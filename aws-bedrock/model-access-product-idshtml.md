# Use product ID condition keys to control

# Use product ID condition keys to control access

The `aws-marketplace:ProductId`

condition key can be used to control the
ability to subscribe to Amazon Bedrock serverless models that have a product ID in AWS Marketplace. To learn
how to use the product ID condition key, see the examples in [Grant IAM permissions to request access to
Amazon Bedrock foundation models with a product ID](./model-access.html#model-access-permissions).

###### Note

Models from the following providers aren't sold through AWS Marketplace and don't have product keys, so you can't scope the `aws-marketplace`

actions to them:

-
Amazon

-
DeepSeek

-
Mistral AI

-
Meta

-
Qwen

-
OpenAI


You can, however, prevent the usage of these models by denying Amazon Bedrock actions and specifying these model IDs in the `Resource`

field. For an example, see [Prevent an identity from using a model
after access has already been granted](./model-access.html#model-access-prevent-usage).

The following table lists product IDs for Amazon Bedrock serverless foundation models that have a product ID:

You can use the following template to attach an IAM policy that controls model access permissions to a role:
