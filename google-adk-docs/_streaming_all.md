# Configuring streaming behaviour¶

# Configuring streaming behaviour[¶](#configuring-streaming-behaviour)

Supported in ADKPython v0.5.0Experimental

There are some configurations you can set for live(streaming) agents.

It's set by [RunConfig](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py). You should use RunConfig with your [Runner.run_live(...)](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/runners.py).

For example, if you want to set voice config, you can leverage speech_config.

# Bidi-streaming (live) in ADK¶

# Bidi-streaming (live) in ADK[¶](#bidi-streaming-live-in-adk)

Bidirectional (Bidi) streaming (live) in ADK adds the low-latency bidirectional voice and video interaction
capability of [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) to
AI agents.

With bidi-streaming, or live, mode, you can provide end users with the experience of natural, human-like voice conversations, including the ability for the user to interrupt the agent's responses with voice commands. Agents with streaming can process text, audio, and video inputs, and they can provide text and audio output.

-
**Quickstart (Bidi-streaming)**

In this quickstart, you'll build a simple agent and use streaming in ADK to implement low-latency and bidirectional voice and video communication.

# Streaming Tools¶

# Streaming Tools[¶](#streaming-tools)

Streaming tools allows tools(functions) to stream intermediate results back to agents and agents can respond to those intermediate results. For example, we can use streaming tools to monitor the changes of the stock price and have the agent react to it. Another example is we can have the agent monitor the video stream, and when there is changes in video stream, the agent can report the changes.

Info

This is only supported in streaming(live) agents/api.

To define a streaming tool, you must adhere to the following:

**Asynchronous Function:**The tool must be an`async`

Python function.**AsyncGenerator Return Type:**The function must be typed to return an`AsyncGenerator`

. The first type parameter to`AsyncGenerator`

is the type of the data you`yield`

(e.g.,`str`

for text messages, or a custom object for structured data). The second type parameter is typically`None`

if the generator doesn't receive values via`send()`

.

We support two types of streaming tools: - Simple type. This is a one type of streaming tools that only take non-video/-audio streams(the streams that you feed to adk web or adk runner) as input. - Video streaming tools. This only works in video streaming and the video stream(the streams that you feed to adk web or adk runner) will be passed into this function.

Now let's define an agent that can monitor stock price changes and monitor the video stream changes.

import asyncio
from typing import AsyncGenerator
from google.adk.agents import LiveRequestQueue
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.tools.function_tool import FunctionTool

async def monitor_stock_price(stock_symbol: str) -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]:
"""This function will monitor the price for the given stock_symbol in a continuous, streaming and asynchronously way."""
print(f"Start monitor stock price for {stock_symbol}!")
# Let's mock stock price change.
await asyncio.sleep(4)
price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 300"
yield price_alert1
print(price_alert1)
await asyncio.sleep(4)
price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 400"
yield price_alert1
print(price_alert1)
await asyncio.sleep(20)

yield price_alert1
print(price_alert1)
await asyncio.sleep(20)
price_alert1 = f"the price for {stock_symbol} is 500"
yield price_alert1
print(price_alert1)
# for video streaming, `input_stream: LiveRequestQueue` is required and reserved key parameter for ADK to pass the video streams in.

yield response
print("response:", response)
# Wait before checking for new images
await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
# Use this exact function to help ADK stop your streaming tools when requested.
# for example, if we want to stop `monitor_stock_price`, then the agent will
# invoke this function with stop_streaming(function_name=monitor_stock_price).
def stop_streaming(function_name: str):

# Part 2: Sending messages with LiveRequestQueue¶

# Part 2: Sending messages with LiveRequestQueue[¶](#part-2-sending-messages-with-liverequestqueue)

In Part 1, you learned the four-phase lifecycle of ADK Bidi-streaming applications. This part focuses on the upstream flow—how your application sends messages to the agent using `LiveRequestQueue`

.

Unlike traditional APIs where different message types require different endpoints or channels, ADK provides a single unified interface through `LiveRequestQueue`

and its `LiveRequest`

message model. This part covers:

**Message types**: Sending text via`send_content()`

, streaming audio/image/video via`send_realtime()`

, controlling conversation turns with activity signals, and gracefully terminating sessions with control signals**Concurrency patterns**: Understanding async queue management and event-loop thread safety**Best practices**: Creating queues in async context, ensuring proper resource cleanup, and understanding message ordering guarantees**Troubleshooting**: Diagnosing common issues like messages not being processed and queue lifecycle problems

Understanding `LiveRequestQueue`

is essential for building responsive streaming applications that handle multimodal inputs seamlessly within async event loops.

## LiveRequestQueue and LiveRequest[¶](#liverequestqueue-and-liverequest)

The `LiveRequestQueue`

is your primary interface for sending messages to the Agent in streaming conversations. Rather than managing separate channels for text, audio, and control signals, ADK provides a unified `LiveRequest`

container that handles all message types through a single, elegant API:

[live_request_queue.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/29c1115959b0084ac1169748863b35323da3cf50/src/google/adk/agents/live_request_queue.py)

class LiveRequest(BaseModel):
content: Optional[Content] = None # Text-based content and structured data
blob: Optional[Blob] = None # Audio/video data and binary streams
activity_start: Optional[ActivityStart] = None # Signal start of user activity
activity_end: Optional[ActivityEnd] = None # Signal end of user activity
close: bool = False # Graceful connection termination signal


This streamlined design handles every streaming scenario you'll encounter. The `content`

and `blob`

fields handle different data types, the `activity_start`

and `activity_end`

fields enable activity signaling, and the `close`

flag provides graceful termination semantics.

The `content`

and `blob`

fields are mutually exclusive—only one can be set per LiveRequest. While ADK does not enforce this client-side and will attempt to send both if set, the Live API backend will reject this with a validation error. ADK's convenience methods `send_content()`

and `send_realtime()`

automatically ensure this constraint is met by setting only one field, so **using these methods (rather than manually creating LiveRequest objects) is the recommended approach**.

The following diagram illustrates how different message types flow from your application through `LiveRequestQueue`

methods, into `LiveRequest`

containers, and finally to the Live API:

```

## Sending Different Message Types[¶](#sending-different-message-types)

`LiveRequestQueue`

provides convenient methods for sending different message types to the agent. This section demonstrates practical patterns for text messages, audio/video streaming, activity signals for manual turn control, and session termination.

### send_content(): Sends Text With Turn-by-Turn[¶](#send_content-sends-text-with-turn-by-turn)

The `send_content()`

method sends text messages in turn-by-turn mode, where each message represents a discrete conversation turn. This signals a complete turn to the model, triggering immediate response generation.

[main.py:194-199](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L194-L199)

content = types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text=json_message["text"])])
live_request_queue.send_content(content)


**Using Content and Part with ADK Bidi-streaming:**

-
(`Content`

`google.genai.types.Content`

): A container that represents a single message or turn in the conversation. It holds an array of`Part`

objects that together compose the complete message. -
(`Part`

`google.genai.types.Part`

): An individual piece of content within a message. For ADK Bidi-streaming with Live API, you'll use: `text`

: Text content (including code) that you send to the model

In practice, most messages use a single text Part for ADK Bidi-streaming. The multi-part structure is designed for scenarios like: - Mixing text with function responses (automatically handled by ADK) - Combining text explanations with structured data - Future extensibility for new content types

For Live API, multimodal inputs (audio/video) use different mechanisms (see `send_realtime()`

below), not multi-part Content.

Content and Part usage in ADK Bidi-streaming

While the Gemini API `Part`

type supports many fields (`inline_data`

, `file_data`

, `function_call`

, `function_response`

, etc.), most are either handled automatically by ADK or use different mechanisms in Live API:

**Function calls**: ADK automatically handles the function calling loop - receiving function calls from the model, executing your registered functions, and sending responses back. You don't manually construct these.**Images/Video**: Do NOT use`send_content()`

with`inline_data`

. Instead, use`send_realtime(Blob(mime_type="image/jpeg", data=...))`

for continuous streaming. See[Part 5: How to Use Image and Video](../part5/#how-to-use-image-and-video).

### send_realtime(): Sends Audio, Image and Video in Real-Time[¶](#send_realtime-sends-audio-image-and-video-in-real-time)

The `send_realtime()`

method sends binary data streams—primarily audio, image and video—flow through the `Blob`

type, which handles transmission in realtime mode. Unlike text content that gets processed in turn-by-turn mode, blobs are designed for continuous streaming scenarios where data arrives in chunks. You provide raw bytes, and Pydantic automatically handles base64 encoding during JSON serialization for safe network transmission (configured in `LiveRequest.model_config`

). The MIME type helps the model understand the content format.

[main.py:181-184](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L181-L184)

audio_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data=audio_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)

For complete details on audio, image and video specifications, formats, and best practices, see [Part 5: How to Use Audio, Image and Video](../part5/).

### Activity Signals[¶](#activity-signals)

Activity signals (`ActivityStart`

/`ActivityEnd`

) can **ONLY** be sent when automatic (server-side) Voice Activity Detection is **explicitly disabled** in your `RunConfig`

. Use them when your application requires manual voice activity control, such as:

**Push-to-talk interfaces**: User explicitly controls when they're speaking (e.g., holding a button)**Noisy environments**: Background noise makes automatic VAD unreliable, so you use client-side VAD or manual control**Client-side VAD**: You implement your own VAD algorithm on the client to reduce network overhead by only sending audio when speech is detected**Custom interaction patterns**: Non-speech scenarios like gesture-triggered interactions or timed audio segments

**What activity signals tell the model:**

`ActivityStart`

: "The user is now speaking - start accumulating audio for processing"`ActivityEnd`

: "The user has finished speaking - process the accumulated audio and generate a response"

Without these signals (when VAD is disabled), the model doesn't know when to start/stop listening for speech, so you must explicitly mark turn boundaries.

**Sending Activity Signals:**

from google.genai import types
# Manual activity signal pattern (e.g., push-to-talk)
live_request_queue.send_activity_start() # Signal: user started speaking
# Stream audio chunks while user holds the talk button
while user_is_holding_button:
audio_blob = types.Blob(mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000", data=audio_chunk)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)
live_request_queue.send_activity_end() # Signal: user stopped speaking


**Default behavior (automatic VAD):** If you don't send activity signals, Live API's built-in VAD automatically detects speech boundaries in the audio stream you send via `send_realtime()`

. This is the recommended approach for most applications.

Learn More

For detailed comparison of automatic VAD vs manual activity signals, including when to disable VAD and best practices, see [Part 5: Voice Activity Detection](../part5/#voice-activity-detection-vad).

### Control Signals[¶](#control-signals)

The `close`

signal provides graceful termination semantics for streaming sessions. It signals the system to cleanly close the model connection and end the Bidi-stream. In ADK Bidi-streaming, your application is responsible for sending the `close`

signal explicitly:

**Manual closure in BIDI mode:** When using `StreamingMode.BIDI`

(Bidi-streaming), your application should manually call `close()`

when the session terminates or when errors occur. This practice minimizes session resource usage.

**Automatic closure in SSE mode:** When using the legacy `StreamingMode.SSE`

(not Bidi-streaming), ADK automatically calls `close()`

on the queue when it receives a `turn_complete=True`

event from the model (see [ base_llm_flow.py:781](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fd2c0f556b786417a9f6add744827b07e7a06b7d/src/google/adk/flows/llm_flows/base_llm_flow.py#L780)).

See [Part 4: Understanding RunConfig](../part4/#streamingmode-bidi-or-sse) for detailed comparison and when to use each mode.

[main.py:238-253](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L238-L253)

try:
logger.debug("Starting asyncio.gather for upstream and downstream tasks")
await asyncio.gather(
upstream_task(),
downstream_task()
)
logger.debug("asyncio.gather completed normally")
except WebSocketDisconnect:
logger.debug("Client disconnected normally")
except Exception as e:
logger.error(f"Unexpected error in streaming tasks: {e}", exc_info=True)
finally:
# Always close the queue, even if exceptions occurred
logger.debug("Closing live_request_queue")
live_request_queue.close()


**What happens if you don't call close()?**

Although ADK cleans up local resources automatically, failing to call `close()`

in BIDI mode prevents sending a graceful termination signal to the Live API, which will then receive an abrupt disconnection after certain timeout period. This can lead to "zombie" Live API sessions that remain open on the cloud service, even though your application has finished with them. These stranded sessions may significantly decrease the number of concurrent sessions your application can handle, as they continue to count against your quota limits until they eventually timeout.

Learn More

For comprehensive error handling patterns during streaming, including when to use `break`

vs `continue`

and handling different error types, see [Part 3: Error Events](../part3/#error-events).

## Concurrency and Thread Safety[¶](#concurrency-and-thread-safety)

Understanding how `LiveRequestQueue`

handles concurrency is essential for building reliable streaming applications. The queue is built on `asyncio.Queue`

, which means it's safe for concurrent access **within the same event loop thread** (the common case), but requires special handling when called from **different threads** (the advanced case). This section explains the design choices behind `LiveRequestQueue`

's API, when you can safely use it without extra precautions, and when you need thread-safety mechanisms like `loop.call_soon_threadsafe()`

.

### Async Queue Management[¶](#async-queue-management)

`LiveRequestQueue`

uses synchronous methods (`send_content()`

, `send_realtime()`

) instead of async methods, even though the underlying queue is consumed asynchronously. This design choice uses `asyncio.Queue.put_nowait()`

- a non-blocking operation that doesn't require `await`

.

**Why synchronous send methods?** Convenience and simplicity. You can call them from anywhere in your async code without `await`

:

[main.py:169-199](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L169-L199)

async def upstream_task() -> None:
"""Receives messages from WebSocket and sends to LiveRequestQueue."""
while True:
message = await websocket.receive()
if "bytes" in message:
audio_data = message["bytes"]
audio_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data=audio_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)
elif "text" in message:
text_data = message["text"]
json_message = json.loads(text_data)
if json_message.get("type") == "text":
content = types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text=json_message["text"])])
live_request_queue.send_content(content)


This pattern mixes async I/O operations with sync CPU operations naturally. The send methods return immediately without blocking, allowing your application to stay responsive.

#### Best Practice: Create Queue in Async Context[¶](#best-practice-create-queue-in-async-context)

Always create `LiveRequestQueue`

within an async context (async function or coroutine) to ensure it uses the correct event loop:

# ✅ Recommended - Create in async context
async def main():
queue = LiveRequestQueue() # Uses existing event loop from async context
# This is the preferred pattern - ensures queue uses the correct event loop
# that will run your streaming operations
# ❌ Not recommended - Creates event loop automatically
queue = LiveRequestQueue() # Works but ADK auto-creates new loop
# This works due to ADK's safety mechanism, but may cause issues with
# loop coordination in complex applications or multi-threaded scenarios


**Why this matters:** `LiveRequestQueue`

requires an event loop to exist when instantiated. ADK includes a safety mechanism that auto-creates a loop if none exists, but relying on this can cause unexpected behavior in multi-threaded scenarios or with custom event loop configurations.

## Message Ordering Guarantees[¶](#message-ordering-guarantees)

`LiveRequestQueue`

provides predictable message delivery behavior:

| Guarantee | Description | Impact |
|---|---|---|
FIFO ordering |
Messages processed in send order (guaranteed by underlying `asyncio.Queue` ) |
Maintains conversation context and interaction consistency |
No coalescing |
Each message delivered independently | No automatic batching—each send operation creates one request |
Unbounded by default |
Queue accepts unlimited messages without blocking | Benefit: Simplifies client code (no blocking on send)Risk: Memory growth if sending faster than processingMitigation: Monitor queue depth in production |


Production Tip: For high-throughput audio/video streaming, monitor`live_request_queue._queue.qsize()`

to detect backpressure. If the queue depth grows continuously, slow down your send rate or implement batching. Note:`_queue`

is an internal attribute and may change in future releases; use with caution.

## Summary[¶](#summary)

In this part, you learned how `LiveRequestQueue`

provides a unified interface for sending messages to ADK streaming agents within an async event loop. We covered the `LiveRequest`

message model and explored how to send different message types: text content via `send_content()`

, audio/video blobs via `send_realtime()`

, activity signals for manual turn control, and control signals for graceful termination via `close()`

. You also learned best practices for async queue management, creating queues in async context, resource cleanup, and message ordering. You now understand how to use `LiveRequestQueue`

as the upstream communication channel in your Bidi-streaming applications, enabling users to send messages concurrently while receiving agent responses. Next, you'll learn how to handle the downstream flow—processing the events that agents generate in response to these messages.

# Part 4: Understanding RunConfig[¶](#part-4-understanding-runconfig)

In Part 3, you learned how to handle events from `run_live()`

to process model responses, tool calls, and streaming updates. This part shows you how to configure those streaming sessions through `RunConfig`

—controlling response formats, managing session lifecycles, and enforcing production constraints.

**What you'll learn**: This part covers response modalities and their constraints, explores the differences between BIDI and SSE streaming modes, examines the relationship between ADK Sessions and Live API sessions, and shows how to manage session duration with session resumption and context window compression. You'll understand how to handle concurrent session quotas, implement architectural patterns for quota management, and configure cost controls through `max_llm_calls`

and audio persistence options. With RunConfig mastery, you can build production-ready streaming applications that balance feature richness with operational constraints.

Response modalities control how the model generates output—as text or audio. Both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API have the same restriction: only one response modality per session.

**Configuration:**

# Phase 2: Session initialization - RunConfig determines streaming behavior
# Default behavior: ADK automatically sets response_modalities to ["AUDIO"]
# when not specified (required by native audio models)
run_config = RunConfig(
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)
# The above is equivalent to:
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"], # Automatically set by ADK in run_live()
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)
# ✅ CORRECT: Text-only responses
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["TEXT"], # Model responds with text only
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI # Still uses bidirectional streaming
)
# ✅ CORRECT: Audio-only responses (explicit)
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"], # Model responds with audio only
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)


Both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API restrict sessions to a single response modality. Attempting to use both will result in an API error:

# ❌ INCORRECT: Both modalities not supported
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["TEXT", "AUDIO"], # ERROR: Cannot use both
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI
)
# Error from Live API: "Only one response modality is supported per session"


**Default Behavior:**

When `response_modalities`

is not specified, ADK's `run_live()`

method automatically sets it to `["AUDIO"]`

because native audio models require an explicit response modality. You can override this by explicitly setting `response_modalities=["TEXT"]`

if needed.

**Key constraints:**

- You must choose either
`TEXT`

or`AUDIO`

at session start.**Cannot switch between modalities mid-session** - You must choose
`AUDIO`

for[Native Audio models](../part5/#understanding-audio-model-architectures). If you want to receive both audio and text responses from native audio models, use the Audio Transcript feature which provides text transcripts of the audio output. See[Audio Transcription](../part5/#audio-transcription)for details - Response modality only affects model output—
**you can always send text, voice, or video input (if the model supports those input modalities)**regardless of the chosen response modality

## StreamingMode: BIDI or SSE[¶](#streamingmode-bidi-or-sse)

ADK supports two distinct streaming modes that use different API endpoints and protocols:

`StreamingMode.BIDI`

: ADK uses WebSocket to connect to the**Live API**(the bidirectional streaming endpoint via`live.connect()`

)`StreamingMode.SSE`

: ADK uses HTTP streaming to connect to the**standard Gemini API**(the unary/streaming endpoint via`generate_content_async()`

)

"Live API" refers specifically to the bidirectional WebSocket endpoint (`live.connect()`

), while "Gemini API" or "standard Gemini API" refers to the traditional HTTP-based endpoint (`generate_content()`

/ `generate_content_async()`

). Both are part of the broader Gemini API platform but use different protocols and capabilities.

**Note:** These modes refer to the **ADK-to-Gemini API communication protocol**, not your application's client-facing architecture. You can build WebSocket servers, REST APIs, SSE endpoints, or any other architecture for your clients with either mode.

This guide focuses on `StreamingMode.BIDI`

, which is required for real-time audio/video interactions and Live API features. However, it's worth understanding the differences between BIDI and SSE modes to choose the right approach for your use case.

**Configuration:**

from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode
# BIDI streaming for real-time audio/video
run_config = RunConfig(
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI,
response_modalities=["AUDIO"] # Supports audio/video modalities
)
# SSE streaming for text-based interactions
run_config = RunConfig(
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
response_modalities=["TEXT"] # Text-only modality
)


### Protocol and Implementation Differences[¶](#protocol-and-implementation-differences)

The two streaming modes differ fundamentally in their communication patterns and capabilities. BIDI mode enables true bidirectional communication where you can send new input while receiving model responses, while SSE mode follows a traditional request-then-response pattern where you send a complete request and stream back the response.

**StreamingMode.BIDI - Bidirectional WebSocket Communication:**

BIDI mode establishes a persistent WebSocket connection that allows simultaneous sending and receiving. This enables real-time features like interruptions, live audio streaming, and immediate turn-taking:

```
sequenceDiagram
participant App as Your Application
participant ADK as ADK
participant Queue as LiveRequestQueue
participant Gemini as Gemini Live API
Note over ADK,Gemini: Protocol: WebSocket
App->>ADK: runner.run_live(run_config)
ADK->>Gemini: live.connect() - WebSocket
activate Gemini
Note over ADK,Queue: Can send while receiving
App->>Queue: send_content(text)
Queue->>Gemini: → Content (via WebSocket)
App->>Queue: send_realtime(audio)
Queue->>Gemini: → Audio blob (via WebSocket)
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial response (partial=True)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text/audio
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial response (partial=True)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text/audio
App->>Queue: send_content(interrupt)
Queue->>Gemini: → New content
Gemini-->>ADK: ← turn_complete=True
ADK-->>App: ← Event: turn complete
deactivate Gemini
Note over ADK,Gemini: Turn Detection: turn_complete flag
```


**StreamingMode.SSE - Unidirectional HTTP Streaming:**

SSE (Server-Sent Events) mode uses HTTP streaming where you send a complete request upfront, then receive the response as a stream of chunks. This is a simpler, more traditional pattern suitable for text-based chat applications:

```
sequenceDiagram
participant App as Your Application
participant ADK as ADK
participant Gemini as Gemini API
Note over ADK,Gemini: Protocol: HTTP
App->>ADK: runner.run(run_config)
ADK->>Gemini: generate_content_stream() - HTTP
activate Gemini
Note over ADK,Gemini: Request sent completely, then stream response
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text
Gemini-->>ADK: ← Final chunk (finish_reason=STOP)
ADK-->>App: ← Event: complete response
deactivate Gemini
Note over ADK,Gemini: Turn Detection: finish_reason
```


### Progressive SSE Streaming[¶](#progressive-sse-streaming)

**Progressive SSE streaming** is a feature that enhances how SSE mode delivers streaming responses. This feature improves response aggregation by:

**Content ordering preservation**: Maintains the original order of mixed content types (text, function calls, inline data)**Intelligent text merging**: Only merges consecutive text parts of the same type (regular text vs thought text)**Progressive delivery**: Marks all intermediate chunks as`partial=True`

, with a single final aggregated response at the end**Deferred function execution**: Skips executing function calls in partial events, only executing them in the final aggregated event to ensure parallel function calls are executed together rather than sequentially**Function call argument streaming**: Supports progressive building of function call arguments through`partial_args`

, enabling real-time display of function call construction

**Default Behavior:**

When you use `StreamingMode.SSE`

, progressive SSE streaming is **enabled by default**. This means you automatically benefit from these improvements without any additional configuration.

**Disabling the feature (if needed):**

If you need to revert to the legacy SSE streaming behavior (simple text accumulation), you can disable it via environment variable:

Legacy Behavior Trade-offs

Disabling progressive SSE streaming reverts to simple text accumulation, which:
- May lose original content ordering when mixing text and function calls
- Does not support function call argument streaming via `partial_args`

- Is provided for backward compatibility only—new applications should use the default progressive mode

**When progressive SSE streaming helps:**

- You're using
`StreamingMode.SSE`

and have mixed content types (text + function calls) - Your responses include thought text (extended thinking) mixed with regular text
- You want to ensure function calls execute only once after complete response aggregation
- You need to display function call construction in real-time as arguments stream in

**Note:** This feature only affects `StreamingMode.SSE`

. It does not apply to `StreamingMode.BIDI`

(the focus of this guide), which uses the Live API's native bidirectional protocol.

### When to Use Each Mode[¶](#when-to-use-each-mode)

Your choice between BIDI and SSE depends on your application requirements and the interaction patterns you need to support. Here's a practical guide to help you choose:

**Use BIDI when:**

- Building voice/video applications with real-time interaction
- Need bidirectional communication (send while receiving)
- Require Live API features (audio transcription, VAD, proactivity, affective dialog)
- Supporting interruptions and natural turn-taking (see
[Part 3: Handling Interrupted Flag](../part3/#handling-interrupted-flag)) - Implementing live streaming tools or real-time data feeds
- Can plan for concurrent session quotas (50-1,000 sessions depending on platform/tier)

**Use SSE when:**

- Building text-based chat applications
- Standard request/response interaction pattern
- Using models without Live API support (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Simpler deployment without WebSocket requirements
- Need larger context windows (Gemini 1.5 supports up to 2M tokens)
- Prefer standard API rate limits (RPM/TPM) over concurrent session quotas

Streaming Mode and Model Compatibility

SSE mode uses the standard Gemini API (`generate_content_async`

) via HTTP streaming, while BIDI mode uses the Live API (`live.connect()`

) via WebSocket. Gemini 1.5 models (Pro, Flash) don't support the Live API protocol and therefore must be used with SSE mode. Gemini 2.0/2.5 Live models support both protocols but are typically used with BIDI mode to access real-time audio/video features.

### Standard Gemini Models (1.5 Series) Accessed via SSE[¶](#standard-gemini-models-15-series-accessed-via-sse)

While this guide focuses on Bidi-streaming with Gemini 2.0 Live models, ADK also supports the Gemini 1.5 model family through SSE streaming. These models offer different trade-offs—larger context windows and proven stability, but without real-time audio/video features. Here's what the 1.5 series supports when accessed via SSE:

**Models:**

`gemini-1.5-pro`

`gemini-1.5-flash`


**Supported:**

- ✅ Text input/output (
`response_modalities=["TEXT"]`

) - ✅ SSE streaming (
`StreamingMode.SSE`

) - ✅ Function calling with automatic execution
- ✅ Large context windows (up to 2M tokens for 1.5-pro)

**Not Supported:**

- ❌ Live audio features (audio I/O, transcription, VAD)
- ❌ Bidi-streaming via
`run_live()`

- ❌ Proactivity and affective dialog
- ❌ Video input

## Understanding Live API Connections and Sessions[¶](#understanding-live-api-connections-and-sessions)

When building ADK Bidi-streaming applications, it's essential to understand how ADK manages the communication layer between itself and the Live API backend. This section explores the fundamental distinction between **connections** (the WebSocket transport links that ADK establishes to Live API) and **sessions** (the logical conversation contexts maintained by Live API). Unlike traditional request-response APIs, the Bidi-streaming architecture introduces unique constraints: connection timeouts, session duration limits that vary by modality (audio-only vs audio+video), finite context windows, and concurrent session quotas that differ between Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API.

### ADK `Session`

vs Live API Session[¶](#adk-session-vs-live-api-session)

Understanding the distinction between **ADK Session** and

**Live API session**is crucial for building reliable streaming applications with ADK Bidi-streaming.

**ADK Session** (managed by SessionService):
- Persistent conversation storage for conversation history, events, and state, created via

`SessionService.create_session()`

- Storage options: in-memory, database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite), or Vertex AI
- Survives across multiple `run_live()`

calls and application restarts (with the persistent `SessionService`

)**Live API session** (managed by Live API backend):
- Maintained by the Live API during the `run_live()`

event loop is running, and destroyed when streaming ends by calling `LiveRequestQueue.close()`

- Subject to platform duration limits, and can be resumed across multiple connections using session resumption handles (see [How ADK Manages Session Resumption](#how-adk-manages-session-resumption) below)

**How they work together:**

**When**`run_live()`

is called:- Retrieves the ADK
`Session`

from`SessionService`

- Initializes the Live API session with conversation history from
`session.events`

- Streams events bidirectionally with the Live API backend
- Updates the ADK
`Session`

with new events as they occur **When**`run_live()`

ends- The Live API session terminates
- The ADK
`Session`

persists **When**or`run_live()`

is called again**the application is restarted**:- ADK loads the history from the ADK
`Session`

- Creates a new Live API session with that context

- ADK loads the history from the ADK

In short, ADK `Session`

provides persistent, long-term conversation storage, while Live API sessions are ephemeral streaming contexts. This separation enables production applications to maintain conversation continuity across network interruptions, application restarts, and multiple streaming sessions.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between ADK Session persistence and ephemeral Live API session contexts, showing how conversation history is maintained across multiple `run_live()`

calls:

```
sequenceDiagram

App->>ADK: runner.run_live(...)
ADK->>LiveSession: Initialize new session with full history
activate LiveSession
Note over ADK,LiveSession: Bidirectional streaming continues...
```


**Key insights:**
- ADK Session survives across multiple `run_live()`

calls and app restarts
- Live API session is ephemeral - created and destroyed per streaming session
- Conversation continuity is maintained through ADK Session's persistent storage
- SessionService manages the persistence layer (in-memory, database, or Vertex AI)

Now that we understand the difference between ADK `Session`

objects and Live API sessions, let's focus on Live API connections and sessions—the backend infrastructure that powers real-time bidirectional streaming.

### Live API Connections and Sessions[¶](#live-api-connections-and-sessions)

Understanding the distinction between **connections** and **sessions** at the Live API level is crucial for building reliable ADK Bidi-streaming applications.

**Connection**: The physical WebSocket link between ADK and the Live API server. This is the network transport layer that carries bidirectional streaming data.

**Session**: The logical conversation context maintained by the Live API, including conversation history, tool call state, and model context. A session can span multiple connections.

Aspect |
Connection |
Session |
|---|---|---|
What is it? |
WebSocket network connection | Logical conversation context |
Scope |
Transport layer | Application layer |
Can span? |
Single network link | Multiple connections via resumption |
Failure impact |
Network error or timeout | Lost conversation history |

#### Live API Connection and Session Limits by Platform[¶](#live-api-connection-and-session-limits-by-platform)

Understanding the constraints of each platform is critical for production planning. Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API have different limits that affect how long conversations can run and how many users can connect simultaneously. The most important distinction is between **connection duration** (how long a single WebSocket connection stays open) and **session duration** (how long a logical conversation can continue).

| Constraint Type | Gemini Live API (Google AI Studio) |
Vertex AI Live API (Google Cloud) |
Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
Connection duration |
~10 minutes | Not documented separately | Each Gemini WebSocket connection auto-terminates; ADK reconnects transparently with session resumption |
Session Duration (Audio-only) |
15 minutes | 10 minutes | Maximum session duration without context window compression. Both platforms: unlimited with context window compression enabled |
Session Duration (Audio + video) |
2 minutes | 10 minutes | Gemini has shorter limit for video; Vertex treats all sessions equally. Both platforms: unlimited with context window compression enabled |
Concurrent sessions |
50 (Tier 1) 1,000 (Tier 2+) |
Up to 1,000 | Gemini limits vary by API tier; Vertex limit is per Google Cloud project |

## Live API Session Resumption[¶](#live-api-session-resumption)

By default, the Live API limits connection duration to approximately 10 minutes—each WebSocket connection automatically closes after this duration. To overcome this limit and enable longer conversations, the **Live API provides Session Resumption**, a feature that transparently migrates a session across multiple connections. When enabled, the Live API generates resumption handles that allow reconnecting to the same session context, preserving the full conversation history and state.

**ADK automates this entirely**: When you enable session resumption in RunConfig, ADK automatically handles all reconnection logic—detecting connection closures, caching resumption handles, and reconnecting seamlessly in the background. You don't need to write any reconnection code. Sessions continue seamlessly beyond the 10-minute connection limit, handling connection timeouts, network disruptions, and planned reconnections automatically.

### Scope of ADK's Reconnection Management[¶](#scope-of-adks-reconnection-management)

ADK manages the **ADK-to-Live API connection** (the WebSocket between ADK and the Gemini/Vertex Live API backend). This is transparent to your application code.

**Your application remains responsible for**:

- Managing client connections to your application (e.g., user's WebSocket to your FastAPI server)
- Implementing client-side reconnection logic if needed
- Handling network failures between clients and your application

When ADK reconnects to the Live API, your application's event loop continues normally—you keep receiving events from `run_live()`

without interruption. From your application's perspective, the Live API session continues seamlessly.

**Configuration:**

from google.genai import types
run_config = RunConfig(
session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)


**When NOT to Enable Session Resumption:**

While session resumption is recommended for most production applications, consider these scenarios where you might not need it:

**Short sessions (<10 minutes)**: If your sessions typically complete within the ~10 minute connection timeout, resumption adds unnecessary overhead**Stateless interactions**: Request-response style interactions where each turn is independent don't benefit from session continuity**Development/testing**: Simpler debugging when each session starts fresh without carrying over state**Cost-sensitive deployments**: Session resumption may incur additional platform costs or resource usage (verify with your platform)

**Best practice**: Enable session resumption by default for production, disable only when you have a specific reason not to use it.

### How ADK Manages Session Resumption[¶](#how-adk-manages-session-resumption)

While session resumption is supported by both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API, using it directly requires managing resumption handles, detecting connection closures, and implementing reconnection logic. ADK takes full responsibility for this complexity, automatically utilizing session resumption behind the scenes so developers don't need to write any reconnection code. You simply enable it in RunConfig, and ADK handles everything transparently.

**ADK's automatic management:**

**Initial Connection**: ADK establishes a WebSocket connection to Live API**Handle Updates**: Throughout the session, the Live API sends`session_resumption_update`

messages containing updated handles. ADK automatically caches the latest handle in`InvocationContext.live_session_resumption_handle`

**Graceful Connection Close**: When the ~10 minute connection limit is reached, the WebSocket closes gracefully (no exception)**Automatic Reconnection**: ADK's internal loop detects the close and automatically reconnects using the most recent cached handle**Session Continuation**: The same session continues seamlessly with full context preserved

Implementation Detail

During reconnection, ADK retrieves the cached handle from `InvocationContext.live_session_resumption_handle`

and includes it in the new `LiveConnectConfig`

for the `live.connect()`

call. This is handled entirely by ADK's internal reconnection loop—developers never need to access or manage these handles directly.

### Sequence Diagram: Automatic Reconnection[¶](#sequence-diagram-automatic-reconnection)

The following sequence diagram illustrates how ADK automatically manages Live API session resumption when the ~10 minute connection timeout is reached. ADK detects the graceful close, retrieves the cached resumption handle, and reconnects transparently without application code changes:

Events and Session Persistence

For details on which events are saved to the ADK `Session`

versus which are only yielded during streaming, see [Part 3: Events Saved to ADK Session](../part3/#events-saved-to-adk-session).

## Live API Context Window Compression[¶](#live-api-context-window-compression)

**Problem:** Live API sessions face two critical constraints that limit conversation duration. First, **session duration limits** impose hard time caps: without compression, Gemini Live API limits audio-only sessions to 15 minutes and audio+video sessions to just 2 minutes, while Vertex AI limits all sessions to 10 minutes. Second, **context window limits** restrict conversation length: models have finite token capacities (128k tokens for `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`

, 32k-128k for Vertex AI models). Long conversations—especially extended customer support sessions, tutoring interactions, or multi-hour voice dialogues—will hit either the time limit or the token limit, causing the session to terminate or lose critical conversation history.

**Solution:** [Context window compression](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-session#context-window-compression) solves both constraints simultaneously. It uses a sliding-window approach to automatically compress or summarize earlier conversation history when the token count reaches a configured threshold. The Live API preserves recent context in full detail while compressing older portions. **Critically, enabling context window compression extends session duration to unlimited time**, removing the session duration limits (15 minutes for audio-only / 2 minutes for audio+video on Gemini Live API; 10 minutes for all sessions on Vertex AI) while also preventing token limit exhaustion. However, there is a trade-off: as the feature summarizes earlier conversation history rather than retaining it all, the detail of past context will be gradually lost over time. The model will have access to compressed summaries of older exchanges, not the full verbatim history.

### Platform Behavior and Official Limits[¶](#platform-behavior-and-official-limits)

Session duration management and context window compression are **Live API platform features**. ADK configures these features via RunConfig and passes the configuration to the Live API, but the actual enforcement and implementation are handled by the Gemini/Vertex AI Live API backends.

**Important**: The duration limits and "unlimited" session behavior mentioned in this guide are based on current Live API behavior. These limits are subject to change by Google. Always verify current session duration limits and compression behavior in the official documentation:

ADK provides an easy way to configure context window compression through RunConfig. However, developers are responsible for appropriately configuring the compression parameters (`trigger_tokens`

and `target_tokens`

) based on their specific requirements—model context window size, expected conversation patterns, and quality needs:

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
# For gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025 (128k context window)
run_config = RunConfig(
context_window_compression=types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
trigger_tokens=100000, # Start compression at ~78% of 128k context
sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(
target_tokens=80000 # Compress to ~62% of context, preserving recent turns
)
)
)


**How it works:**

When context window compression is enabled:

- The Live API monitors the total token count of the conversation context
- When the context reaches the
`trigger_tokens`

threshold, compression activates - Earlier conversation history is compressed or summarized using a sliding window approach
- Recent context (last
`target_tokens`

worth) is preserved in full detail **Two critical effects occur simultaneously:**- Session duration limits are removed (no more 15-minute/2-minute caps on Gemini Live API or 10-minute caps on Vertex AI)
- Token limits are managed (sessions can continue indefinitely regardless of conversation length)

**Choosing appropriate thresholds:**

- Set
`trigger_tokens`

to 70-80% of your model's context window to allow headroom - Set
`target_tokens`

to 60-70% to provide sufficient compression - Test with your actual conversation patterns to optimize these values

**Parameter Selection Strategy:**

The examples above use 78% for `trigger_tokens`

and 62% for `target_tokens`

. Here's the reasoning:

**trigger_tokens at 78%**: Provides a buffer before hitting the hard limit- Allows room for the current turn to complete
- Prevents mid-response compression interruptions
-
Typical conversations can continue for several more turns

-
**target_tokens at 62%**: Leaves substantial room after compression - 16 percentage points (78% - 62%) freed up per compression
- Allows for multiple turns before next compression
-
Balances preservation of context with compression frequency

-
**Adjusting for your use case**: **Long turns**(detailed technical discussions): Increase buffer → 70% trigger, 50% target**Short turns**(quick Q&A): Tighter margins → 85% trigger, 70% target**Context-critical**(requires historical detail): Higher target → 80% trigger, 70% target**Performance-sensitive**(minimize compression overhead): Lower trigger → 70% trigger, 50% target

Always test with your actual conversation patterns to find optimal values.

### When NOT to Use Context Window Compression[¶](#when-not-to-use-context-window-compression)

While compression enables unlimited session duration, consider these trade-offs:

**Context Window Compression Trade-offs:**

| Aspect | With Compression | Without Compression | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
Session Duration |
Unlimited | 15 min (audio) 2 min (video) Gemini 10 min Vertex |
Compression: Long sessions No compression: Short sessions |
Context Quality |
Older context summarized | Full verbatim history | Compression: General conversation No compression: Precision-critical |
Latency |
Compression overhead | No overhead | Compression: Async scenarios No compression: Real-time |
Memory Usage |
Bounded | Grows with session | Compression: Long sessions No compression: Short sessions |
Implementation |
Configure thresholds | No configuration | Compression: Production No compression: Prototypes |

**Common Use Cases:**

✅ **Enable compression when:**
- Sessions need to exceed platform duration limits (15/2/10 minutes)
- Extended conversations may hit token limits (128k for 2.5-flash)
- Customer support sessions that can last hours
- Educational tutoring with long interactions

❌ **Disable compression when:**
- All sessions complete within duration limits
- Precision recall of early conversation is critical
- Development/testing phase (full history aids debugging)
- Quality degradation from summarization is unacceptable

**Best practice**: Enable compression only when you need sessions longer than platform duration limits OR when conversations may exceed context window token limits.

## Best Practices for Live API Connection and Session Management[¶](#best-practices-for-live-api-connection-and-session-management)

### Essential: Enable Session Resumption[¶](#essential-enable-session-resumption)

- ✅
**Always enable session resumption**in RunConfig for production applications - ✅ This enables ADK to automatically handle Gemini's ~10 minute connection timeouts transparently
- ✅ Sessions continue seamlessly across multiple WebSocket connections without user interruption
- ✅ Session resumption handle caching and management

from google.genai import types
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)


### Recommended: Enable Context Window Compression for Unlimited Sessions[¶](#recommended-enable-context-window-compression-for-unlimited-sessions)

- ✅
**Enable context window compression**if you need sessions longer than 15 minutes (audio-only) or 2 minutes (audio+video) - ✅ Once enabled, session duration becomes unlimited—no need to monitor time-based limits
- ✅ Configure
`trigger_tokens`

and`target_tokens`

based on your model's context window - ✅ Test compression settings with realistic conversation patterns
- ⚠️
**Use judiciously**: Compression adds latency during summarization and may lose conversational nuance—only enable when extended sessions are truly necessary for your use case

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig(),
context_window_compression=types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
trigger_tokens=100000,
sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(target_tokens=80000)
)
)


### Optional: Monitor Session Duration[¶](#optional-monitor-session-duration)

**Only applies if NOT using context window compression:**

- ✅ Focus on
**session duration limits**, not connection timeouts (ADK handles those automatically) - ✅
**Gemini Live API**: Monitor for 15-minute limit (audio-only) or 2-minute limit (audio+video) - ✅
**Vertex AI Live API**: Monitor for 10-minute session limit - ✅ Warn users 1-2 minutes before session duration limits
- ✅ Implement graceful session transitions for conversations exceeding session limits

## Concurrent Live API Sessions and Quota Management[¶](#concurrent-live-api-sessions-and-quota-management)

**Problem:** Production voice applications typically serve multiple users simultaneously, each requiring their own Live API session. However, both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API impose strict concurrent session limits that vary by platform and pricing tier. Without proper quota planning and session management, applications can hit these limits quickly, causing connection failures for new users or degraded service quality during peak usage.

**Solution:** Understand platform-specific quotas, design your architecture to stay within concurrent session limits, implement session pooling or queueing strategies when needed, and monitor quota usage proactively. ADK handles individual session lifecycle automatically, but developers must architect their applications to manage multiple concurrent users within quota constraints.

### Understanding Concurrent Live API Session Quotas[¶](#understanding-concurrent-live-api-session-quotas)

Both platforms limit how many Live API sessions can run simultaneously, but the limits and mechanisms differ significantly:

**Gemini Live API (Google AI Studio) - Tier-based quotas:**

Tier |
Concurrent Sessions |
TPM (Tokens Per Minute) |
Access |
|---|---|---|---|
Free Tier |
Limited* | 1,000,000 | Free API key |
Tier 1 |
50 | 4,000,000 | Pay-as-you-go |
Tier 2 |
1,000 | 10,000,000 | Higher usage tier |
Tier 3 |
1,000 | 10,000,000 | Higher usage tier |

*Free tier concurrent session limits are not explicitly documented but are significantly lower than paid tiers.

Source

**Vertex AI Live API (Google Cloud) - Project-based quotas:**

Resource Type |
Limit |
Scope |
|---|---|---|
Concurrent live bidirectional connections |
10 per minute | Per project, per region |
Maximum concurrent sessions |
Up to 1,000 | Per project |
Session creation/deletion/update |
100 per minute | Per project, per region |

Source

**Requesting a quota increase:**

To request an increase for Live API concurrent sessions, navigate to the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the Google Cloud Console. Filter for the quota named **"Bidi generate content concurrent requests"** to find quota values for each project, region and base model, and submit a quota increase request. You'll need the Quota Administrator role (`roles/servicemanagement.quotaAdmin`

) to make the request. See [View and manage quotas](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage) for detailed instructions.

**Key differences:**

-
**Gemini Live API**: Concurrent session limits scale dramatically with API tier (50 → 1,000 sessions). Best for applications with unpredictable or rapidly scaling user bases willing to pay for higher tiers. -
**Vertex AI Live API**: Rate-limited by connection establishment rate (10/min) but supports up to 1,000 total concurrent sessions. Best for enterprise applications with gradual scaling patterns and existing Google Cloud infrastructure. Additionally, you can request quota increases to prepare for production deployments with higher concurrency requirements.

### Architectural Patterns for Managing Quotas[¶](#architectural-patterns-for-managing-quotas)

Once you understand your concurrent session quotas, the next challenge is architecting your application to operate effectively within those limits. The right approach depends on your expected user concurrency, scaling requirements, and tolerance for queueing. This section presents two architectural patterns—from simple direct mapping for low-concurrency applications to session pooling with queueing for applications that may exceed quota limits during peak usage. Choose the pattern that matches your current scale and design it to evolve as your user base grows.

**Choosing the Right Architecture:**

Start: Designing Quota Management

Expected Concurrent Users?
/ \
< Quota Limit > Quota Limit or Unpredictable
| |
v v
Pattern 1: Direct Mapping Pattern 2: Session Pooling
- Simple 1:1 mapping - Queue waiting users
- No quota logic - Graceful degradation
- Fast development - Peak handling
| |
v v
Good for: Good for:
- Prototypes - Production at scale
- Small teams - Unpredictable load
- Controlled users - Public applications


**Quick Decision Guide:**

| Factor | Direct Mapping | Session Pooling |
|---|---|---|
Expected users |
Always < quota | May exceed quota |
User experience |
Always instant | May wait during peaks |
Implementation complexity |
Low | Medium |
Operational overhead |
None | Monitor queue depth |
Best for |
Prototypes, internal tools | Production, public apps |

#### Pattern 1: Direct Mapping (Simple Applications)[¶](#pattern-1-direct-mapping-simple-applications)

For small-scale applications where concurrent users will never exceed quota limits, create a dedicated Live API session for each connected user with a simple 1:1 mapping:

**When a user connects:**Immediately start a`run_live()`

session for them**When they disconnect:**The session ends**No quota management logic:**Assumes your total concurrent users will always stay below your quota limits

This is the simplest possible architecture and works well for prototypes, development environments, and small-scale applications with predictable user loads.

#### Pattern 2: Session Pooling with Queueing[¶](#pattern-2-session-pooling-with-queueing)

For applications that may exceed concurrent session limits during peak usage, track the number of active Live API sessions and enforce your quota limit at the application level:

**When a new user connects:**Check if you have available session slots**If slots are available:**Start a session immediately**If you've reached your quota limit:**- Place the user in a waiting queue
- Notify them they're waiting for an available slot
**As sessions end:**Automatically process the queue to start sessions for waiting users

This provides graceful degradation—users wait briefly during peak times rather than experiencing hard connection failures.

## Miscellaneous Controls[¶](#miscellaneous-controls)

ADK provides additional RunConfig options to control session behavior, manage costs, and persist audio data for debugging and compliance purposes.

run_config = RunConfig(
# Limit total LLM calls per invocation
max_llm_calls=500, # Default: 500 (prevents runaway loops)
# 0 or negative = unlimited (use with caution)
# Save audio/video artifacts for debugging/compliance
save_live_blob=True, # Default: False
# Attach custom metadata to events
custom_metadata={"user_tier": "premium", "session_type": "support"}, # Default: None
# Enable compositional function calling (experimental)
support_cfc=True # Default: False (Gemini 2.x models only)
)


### max_llm_calls[¶](#max_llm_calls)

This parameter caps the total number of LLM invocations allowed per invocation context, providing protection against runaway costs and infinite agent loops.

**Limitation for BIDI Streaming:**

**The max_llm_calls limit does NOT apply to run_live() with StreamingMode.BIDI.** This parameter only protects SSE streaming mode and


`run_async()`

flows. If you're building bidirectional streaming applications (the focus of this guide), you will NOT get automatic cost protection from this parameter.**For Live streaming sessions**, implement your own safeguards:

- Session duration limits
- Turn count tracking
- Custom cost monitoring by tracking token usage in model turn events (see
[Part 3: Event Types and Handling](../part3/#event-types-and-handling)) - Application-level circuit breakers

### save_live_blob[¶](#save_live_blob)

This parameter controls whether audio and video streams are persisted to ADK's session and artifact services for debugging, compliance, and quality assurance purposes.

Migration Note: save_live_audio Deprecated

**If you're using save_live_audio:** This parameter has been deprecated in favor of

`save_live_blob`

. ADK will automatically migrate `save_live_audio=True`

to `save_live_blob=True`

with a deprecation warning, but this compatibility layer will be removed in a future release. Update your code to use `save_live_blob`

instead.Currently, **only audio is persisted** by ADK's implementation. When enabled, ADK persists audio streams to:

: Conversation history includes audio references[Session service](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/): Audio files stored with unique IDs[Artifact service](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/artifacts/)

**Use cases:**

**Debugging**: Voice interaction issues, assistant behavior analysis**Compliance**: Audit trails for regulated industries (healthcare, financial services)**Quality Assurance**: Monitoring conversation quality, identifying issues**Training Data**: Collecting data for model improvement**Development/Testing**: Testing environments and cost-sensitive deployments

**Storage considerations:**

Enabling `save_live_blob=True`

has significant storage implications:

**Audio file sizes**: At 16kHz PCM, audio input generates ~1.92 MB per minute**Session storage**: Audio is stored in both session service and artifact service**Retention policy**: Check your artifact service configuration for retention periods**Cost impact**: Storage costs can accumulate quickly for high-volume voice applications

**Best practices:**

- Enable only when needed (debugging, compliance, training)
- Implement retention policies to auto-delete old audio artifacts
- Consider sampling (e.g., save 10% of sessions for quality monitoring)
- Use compression if supported by your artifact service

### custom_metadata[¶](#custom_metadata)

This parameter allows you to attach arbitrary key-value metadata to events generated during the current invocation. The metadata is stored in the `Event.custom_metadata`

field and persisted to session storage, enabling you to tag events with application-specific context for analytics, debugging, routing, or compliance tracking.

**Configuration:**

from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
# Attach metadata to all events in this invocation
run_config = RunConfig(
custom_metadata={
"user_tier": "premium",
"session_type": "customer_support",
"campaign_id": "promo_2025",
"ab_test_variant": "variant_b"
}
)


**How it works:**

When you provide `custom_metadata`

in RunConfig:

**Metadata attachment**: The dictionary is attached to every`Event`

generated during the invocation**Session persistence**: Events with metadata are stored in the session service (database, Vertex AI, or in-memory)**Event access**: Retrieve metadata from any event via`event.custom_metadata`

**A2A integration**: For Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, ADK automatically propagates A2A request metadata to this field

**Type specification:**

The metadata is a flexible dictionary accepting any JSON-serializable values (strings, numbers, booleans, nested objects, arrays).

**Use cases:**

**User segmentation**: Tag events with user tier, subscription level, or cohort information**Session classification**: Label sessions by type (support, sales, onboarding) for analytics**Campaign tracking**: Associate events with marketing campaigns or experiments**A/B testing**: Track which variant of your application generated the event**Compliance**: Attach jurisdiction, consent flags, or data retention policies**Debugging**: Add trace IDs, feature flags, or environment identifiers**Analytics**: Store custom dimensions for downstream analysis

**Example - Retrieving metadata from events:**

async for event in runner.run_live(
session=session,
live_request_queue=queue,
run_config=RunConfig(
custom_metadata={"user_id": "user_123", "experiment": "new_ui"}
)
):
if event.custom_metadata:
print(f"User: {event.custom_metadata.get('user_id')}")
print(f"Experiment: {event.custom_metadata.get('experiment')}")


**Agent-to-Agent (A2A) integration:**

When using `RemoteA2AAgent`

, ADK automatically extracts metadata from A2A requests and populates `custom_metadata`

:

# A2A request metadata is automatically mapped to custom_metadata
# Source: a2a/converters/request_converter.py
custom_metadata = {
"a2a_metadata": {
# Original A2A request metadata appears here
}
}


This enables seamless metadata propagation across agent boundaries in multi-agent architectures.

**Best practices:**

- Use consistent key naming conventions across your application
- Avoid storing sensitive data (PII, credentials) in metadata—use encryption if necessary
- Keep metadata size reasonable to minimize storage overhead
- Document your metadata schema for team consistency
- Consider using metadata for session filtering and search in production debugging

### support_cfc (Experimental)[¶](#support_cfc-experimental)

This parameter enables Compositional Function Calling (CFC), allowing the model to orchestrate multiple tools in sophisticated patterns—calling tools in parallel, chaining outputs as inputs to other tools, or conditionally executing tools based on intermediate results.

**⚠️ Experimental Feature:** CFC support is experimental and subject to change.

**Critical behavior:** When `support_cfc=True`

, ADK **always uses the Live API** (WebSocket) internally, regardless of the `streaming_mode`

setting. This is because only the Live API backend supports CFC capabilities.

# Even with SSE mode, ADK routes through Live API when CFC is enabled
run_config = RunConfig(
support_cfc=True,
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE # ADK uses Live API internally
)


**Model requirements:**

ADK validates CFC compatibility at session initialization and will raise an error if the model is unsupported:

- ✅
**Supported**:`gemini-2.x`

models (e.g.,`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`

) - ❌
**Not supported**:`gemini-1.5-x`

models **Validation**: ADK checks that the model name starts with`gemini-2`

when`support_cfc=True`

()`runners.py:1322-1328`

**Code executor**: ADK automatically injects`BuiltInCodeExecutor`

when CFC is enabled for safe parallel tool execution

**CFC capabilities:**

**Parallel execution**: Call multiple independent tools simultaneously (e.g., fetch weather for multiple cities at once)**Function chaining**: Use one tool's output as input to another (e.g.,`get_location()`

→`get_weather(location)`

)**Conditional execution**: Execute tools based on intermediate results from prior tool calls

**Use cases:**

CFC is designed for complex, multi-step workflows that benefit from intelligent tool orchestration:

- Data aggregation from multiple APIs simultaneously
- Multi-step analysis pipelines where tools feed into each other
- Complex research tasks requiring conditional exploration
- Any scenario needing sophisticated tool coordination beyond sequential execution

**For bidirectional streaming applications:** While CFC works with BIDI mode, it's primarily optimized for text-based tool orchestration. For real-time audio/video interactions (the focus of this guide), standard function calling typically provides better performance and simpler implementation.

## Summary[¶](#summary)

In this part, you learned how RunConfig enables sophisticated control over ADK Bidi-streaming sessions through declarative configuration. We covered response modalities and their constraints, explored the differences between BIDI and SSE streaming modes, examined the relationship between ADK Sessions and Live API sessions, and learned how to manage session duration with session resumption and context window compression. You now understand how to handle concurrent session quotas, implement architectural patterns for quota management, configure cost controls through `max_llm_calls`

and audio persistence options. With RunConfig mastery, you can build production-ready streaming applications that balance feature richness with operational constraints—enabling extended conversations, managing platform limits, controlling costs effectively, and monitoring resource consumption.

# Part 1: Introduction to ADK Bidi-streaming¶

# Part 1: Introduction to ADK Bidi-streaming[¶](#part-1-introduction-to-adk-bidi-streaming)

Google's Agent Development Kit ([ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)) provides a production-ready framework for building Bidi-streaming applications with Gemini models. This guide introduces ADK's streaming architecture, which enables real-time, two-way communication between users and AI agents through multimodal channels (text, audio, video).

**What you'll learn**: This part covers the fundamentals of Bidi-streaming, the underlying Live API technology (Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API), ADK's architectural components (`LiveRequestQueue`

, `Runner`

, `Agent`

), and a complete FastAPI implementation example. You'll understand how ADK handles session management, tool orchestration, and platform abstraction—reducing months of infrastructure development to declarative configuration.

## ADK Bidi-streaming Demo[¶](#adk-bidi-streaming-demo)

To help you understand the concepts in this guide, we provide a working demo application that showcases ADK bidirectional streaming in action. This FastAPI-based demo implements the complete streaming lifecycle with a practical, real-world architecture.

## 1.1 What is Bidi-streaming?[¶](#11-what-is-bidi-streaming)

Bidi-streaming (Bidirectional streaming) represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI interactions. Instead of the rigid "ask-and-wait" pattern, it enables **real-time, two-way communication** where both human and AI can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This creates natural, human-like conversations with immediate responses and the revolutionary ability to interrupt ongoing interactions.

Think of the difference between sending emails and having a phone conversation. Traditional AI interactions are like emails—you send a complete message, wait for a complete response, then send another complete message. Bidi-streaming is like a phone conversation—fluid, natural, with the ability to interrupt, clarify, and respond in real-time.

### Key Characteristics[¶](#key-characteristics)

These characteristics distinguish Bidi-streaming from traditional AI interactions and make it uniquely powerful for creating engaging user experiences:

-
**Two-way Communication**: Continuous data exchange without waiting for complete responses. Users can interrupt the AI mid-response with new input, creating a natural conversational flow. The AI responds after detecting the user has finished speaking (via automatic voice activity detection or explicit activity signals). -
**Responsive Interruption**: Perhaps the most important feature for the natural user experience—users can interrupt the agent mid-response with new input, just like in human conversation. If an AI is explaining quantum physics and you suddenly ask "wait, what's an electron?", the AI stops immediately and addresses your question. -
**Best for Multimodal**: Bidi-streaming excels at multimodal interactions because it can process different input types simultaneously through a single connection. Users can speak while showing documents, type follow-up questions during voice calls, or seamlessly switch between communication modes without losing context. This unified approach eliminates the complexity of managing separate channels for each modality.

Agent->>Client: "OK, how can I help?" [interrupted: true]
```


### Difference from Other Streaming Types[¶](#difference-from-other-streaming-types)

Understanding how Bidi-streaming differs from other approaches is crucial for appreciating its unique value. The streaming landscape includes several distinct patterns, each serving different use cases:

Streaming Types Comparison

**Bidi-streaming** differs fundamentally from other streaming approaches:

-
**Server-Side Streaming**: One-way data flow from server to client. Like watching a live video stream—you receive continuous data but can't interact with it in real-time. Useful for dashboards or live feeds, but not for conversations. -
**Token-Level Streaming**: Sequential text token delivery without interruption. The AI generates response word-by-word, but you must wait for completion before sending new input. Like watching someone type a message in real-time—you see it forming, but can't interrupt. -
**Bidi-streaming**: Full two-way communication with interruption support. True conversational AI where both parties can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This is what enables natural dialogue where you can interrupt, clarify, or change topics mid-conversation.

### Real-World Applications[¶](#real-world-applications)

Bidi-streaming revolutionizes agentic AI applications by enabling agents to operate with human-like responsiveness and intelligence. These applications showcase how streaming transforms static AI interactions into dynamic, agent-driven experiences that feel genuinely intelligent and proactive.

In a video of the [Shopper's Concierge demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwHPYyw7u6U), the multimodal Bidi-streaming feature significantly improve the user experience of e-commerce by enabling a faster and more intuitive shopping experience. The combination of conversational understanding and rapid, parallelized searching culminates in advanced capabilities like virtual try-on, boosting buyer confidence and reducing the friction of online shopping.

Also, there are many possible real-world applications for Bidi-streaming:

#### Customer Service & Contact Centers[¶](#customer-service-contact-centers)

This is the most direct application. The technology can create sophisticated virtual agents that go far beyond traditional chatbots.

- Use case: A customer calls a retail company's support line about a defective product.
- Multimodality (video): The customer can say, "My coffee machine is leaking from the bottom, let me show you." They can then use their phone's camera to stream live video of the issue. The AI agent can use its vision capabilities to identify the model and the specific point of failure.
- Live Interaction & Interruption: If the agent says, "Okay, I'm processing a return for your Model X coffee maker," the customer can interrupt with, "No, wait, it's the Model Y Pro," and the agent can immediately correct its course without restarting the conversation.

#### E-commerce & Personalized Shopping[¶](#e-commerce-personalized-shopping)

The agent can act as a live, interactive personal shopper, enhancing the online retail experience.

- Use Case: A user is browsing a fashion website and wants styling advice.
- Multimodality (Voice & Image): The user can hold up a piece of clothing to their webcam and ask, "Can you find me a pair of shoes that would go well with these pants?" The agent analyzes the color and style of the pants.
- Live Interaction: The conversation can be a fluid back-and-forth: "Show me something more casual." ... "Okay, how about these sneakers?" ... "Perfect, add the blue ones in size 10 to my cart."

#### Field Service & Technical Assistance[¶](#field-service-technical-assistance)

Technicians working on-site can use a hands-free, voice-activated assistant to get real-time help.

- Use Case: An HVAC technician is on-site trying to diagnose a complex commercial air conditioning unit.
- Multimodality (Video & Voice): The technician, wearing smart glasses or using a phone, can stream their point-of-view to the AI agent. They can ask, "I'm hearing a strange noise from this compressor. Can you identify it and pull up the diagnostic flowchart for this model?"
- Live Interaction: The agent can guide the technician step-by-step, and the technician can ask clarifying questions or interrupt at any point without taking their hands off their tools.

#### Healthcare & Telemedicine[¶](#healthcare-telemedicine)

The agent can serve as a first point of contact for patient intake, triage, and basic consultations.

- Use Case: A patient uses a provider's app for a preliminary consultation about a skin condition.
- Multimodality (Video/Image): The patient can securely share a live video or high-resolution image of a rash. The AI can perform a preliminary analysis and ask clarifying questions.

#### Financial Services & Wealth Management[¶](#financial-services-wealth-management)

An agent can provide clients with a secure, interactive, and data-rich way to manage their finances.

- Use Case: A client wants to review their investment portfolio and discuss market trends.
- Multimodality (Screen Sharing): The agent can share its screen to display charts, graphs, and portfolio performance data. The client could also share their screen to point to a specific news article and ask, "What is the potential impact of this event on my tech stocks?"
- Live Interaction: Analyze the client's current portfolio allocation by accessing their account data.Simulate the impact of a potential trade on the portfolio's risk profile.

## 1.2 Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API[¶](#12-gemini-live-api-and-vertex-ai-live-api)

ADK's Bidi-streaming capabilities are powered by Live API technology, available through two platforms: ** Gemini Live API** (via Google AI Studio) and

**(via Google Cloud). Both provide real-time, low-latency streaming conversations with Gemini models, but serve different development and deployment needs.**

[Vertex AI Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)Throughout this guide, we use **"Live API"** to refer to both platforms collectively, specifying "Gemini Live API" or "Vertex AI Live API" only when discussing platform-specific features or differences.

### What is the Live API?[¶](#what-is-the-live-api)

Live API is Google's real-time conversational AI technology that enables **low-latency Bidi-streaming** with Gemini models. Unlike traditional request-response APIs, Live API establishes persistent WebSocket connections that support:

**Core Capabilities:**

**Multimodal streaming**: Processes continuous streams of audio, video, and text in real-time**Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatically detects when users finish speaking, enabling natural turn-taking without explicit signals. The AI knows when to start responding and when to wait for more input**Immediate responses**: Delivers human-like spoken or text responses with minimal latency**Intelligent interruption**: Enables users to interrupt the AI mid-response, just like human conversations**Audio Transcription**: Real-time transcription of both user input and model output, enabling accessibility features and conversation logging without separate transcription services**Session Management**: Long conversations can span multiple connections through session resumption, with the API preserving full conversation history and context across reconnections**Tool Integration**: Function calling works seamlessly in streaming mode, with tools executing in the background while conversation continues

**Native Audio Model Features:**

**Proactive Audio**: The model can initiate responses based on context awareness, creating more natural interactions where the AI offers help or clarification proactively (Native Audio models only)**Affective Dialog**: Advanced models understand tone of voice and emotional context, adapting responses to match the conversational mood and user sentiment (Native Audio models only)

## 1.3 ADK Bidi-streaming: For Building Realtime Agent Applications[¶](#13-adk-bidi-streaming-for-building-realtime-agent-applications)

Building realtime Agent applications from scratch presents significant engineering challenges. While Live API provides the underlying streaming technology, integrating it into production applications requires solving complex problems: managing WebSocket connections and reconnection logic, orchestrating tool execution and response handling, persisting conversation state across sessions, coordinating concurrent data flows for multimodal inputs, and handling platform differences between development and production environments.

ADK transforms these challenges into simple, declarative APIs. Instead of spending months building infrastructure for session management, tool orchestration, and state persistence, developers can focus on defining agent behavior and creating user experiences. This section explores what ADK handles automatically and why it's the recommended path for building production-ready streaming applications.

**Raw Live API v. ADK Bidi-streaming:**

| Feature | Raw Live API (`google-genai` SDK) |
ADK Bidi-streaming (`adk-python` and `adk-java` SDK) |
|---|---|---|

, `run_live()`

async generator, automatic bidirectional flow coordination (see [Part 2](../part2/)and[Part 3](../part3/))**App-level Session Persistence**[ADK Session docs](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/))### Platform Flexibility[¶](#platform-flexibility)

One of ADK's most powerful features is its transparent support for both [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) and [Vertex AI Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api). This platform flexibility enables a seamless development-to-production workflow: develop locally with Gemini API using free API keys, then deploy to production with Vertex AI using enterprise Google Cloud infrastructure—all **without changing application code**, only environment configuration.

#### How Platform Selection Works[¶](#how-platform-selection-works)

ADK uses the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`

environment variable to determine which Live API platform to use:

`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE`

(or not set): Uses Gemini Live API via Google AI Studio`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE`

: Uses Vertex AI Live API via Google Cloud

This environment variable is read by the underlying `google-genai`

SDK when ADK creates the LLM connection. No code changes are needed when switching platforms—only environment configuration changes.

By handling the complexity of session management, tool orchestration, state persistence, and platform differences, ADK lets you focus on building intelligent agent experiences rather than wrestling with streaming infrastructure. The same code works seamlessly across development and production environments, giving you the full power of Bidi-streaming without the implementation burden.

## 1.4 ADK Bidi-streaming Architecture Overview[¶](#14-adk-bidi-streaming-architecture-overview)

Now that you understand Live API technology and why ADK adds value, let's explore how ADK actually works. This section maps the complete data flow from your application through ADK's pipeline to Live API and back, showing which components handle which responsibilities.

You'll see how key components like `LiveRequestQueue`

, `Runner`

, and `Agent`

orchestrate streaming conversations without requiring you to manage WebSocket connections, coordinate async flows, or handle platform-specific API differences.

| Developer provides: | ADK provides: | Live API provide: |
|---|---|---|
Web / Mobile: Frontend applications that users interact with, handling UI/UX, user input capture, and response display: Real-time communication server (such as
: Custom AI agent definition with specific instructions, tools, and behavior tailored to your application's needs`Agent` |
: Message queue that buffers and sequences incoming user messages (text content, audio blobs, control signals) for orderly processing by the agent
: Execution engine that orchestrates agent sessions, manages conversation state, and provides the
`run_live()` streaming interface: Configuration for streaming behavior, modalities, and advanced features
Internal components (managed automatically, not directly used by developers):
|
(via Google AI Studio) and
(via Google Cloud): Google's real-time language model services that process streaming input, generate responses, handle interruptions, support multimodal content (text, audio, video), and provide advanced AI capabilities like function calling and contextual understanding
|

This architecture demonstrates ADK's clear separation of concerns: your application handles user interaction and transport protocols, ADK manages the streaming orchestration and state, and Live API provide the AI intelligence. By abstracting away the complexity of LLM-side streaming connection management, event loops, and protocol translation, ADK enables you to focus on building agent behavior and user experiences rather than streaming infrastructure.

## 1.5 ADK Bidi-streaming Application Lifecycle[¶](#15-adk-bidi-streaming-application-lifecycle)

ADK Bidi-streaming integrates Live API session into the ADK framework's application lifecycle. This integration creates a four-phase lifecycle that combines ADK's agent management with Live API's real-time streaming capabilities:

**Phase 1: Application Initialization**(Once at Startup)-
ADK Application initialization

- Create an
[Agent](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/): for interacting with users, utilize external tools, and coordinate with other agents. - Create a
[SessionService](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/session/#managing-sessions-with-a-sessionservice): for getting or creating ADK`Session`

- Create a
[Runner](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/runtime/): for providing a runtime for the Agent

- Create an
-
**Phase 2: Session Initialization**(Once per User Session) - ADK
`Session`

initialization:- Get or Create an ADK
`Session`

using the`SessionService`


- Get or Create an ADK
-
ADK Bidi-streaming initialization:

- Create a
[RunConfig](../part4/)for configuring ADK Bidi-streaming - Create a
[LiveRequestQueue](../part2/)for sending user messages to the`Agent`

- Start a
[run_live()](../part3/)event loop

- Create a
-
**Phase 3: Bidi-streaming with**(One or More Times per User Session)`run_live()`

event loop - Upstream: User sends message to the agent with
`LiveRequestQueue`

-
Downstream: Agent responds to the user with

`Event`

-
**Phase 4: Terminate Live API session**(One or More Times per User Session) `LiveRequestQueue.close()`


**Lifecycle Flow Overview:**

```


In the following sections, you'll see each phase detailed, showing exactly when to create each component and how they work together. Understanding this lifecycle pattern is essential for building robust streaming applications that can handle multiple concurrent sessions efficiently.

### Phase 1: Application Initialization[¶](#phase-1-application-initialization)

These components are created once when your application starts and shared across all streaming sessions. They define your agent's capabilities, manage conversation history, and orchestrate the streaming execution.

#### Define Your Agent[¶](#define-your-agent)

The `Agent`

is the core of your streaming application—it defines what your AI can do, how it should behave, and which AI model powers it. You configure your agent with a specific model, tools it can use (like Google Search or custom APIs), and instructions that shape its personality and behavior.

[agent.py:10-15](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/google_search_agent/agent.py#L10-L15)

"""Google Search Agent definition for ADK Bidi-streaming demo."""
import os
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search
# Default models for Live API with native audio support:
# - Gemini Live API: gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025
# - Vertex AI Live API: gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio
agent = Agent(
name="google_search_agent",
model=os.getenv("DEMO_AGENT_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"),
tools=[google_search],
instruction="You are a helpful assistant that can search the web."
)


The agent instance is **stateless and reusable**—you create it once and use it for all streaming sessions. Agent configuration is covered in the [ADK Agent documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/).

Model Availability

For the latest supported models and their capabilities, see [Part 5: Understanding Audio Model Architectures](../part5/#understanding-audio-model-architectures).

Agent vs LlmAgent

`Agent`

is the recommended shorthand for `LlmAgent`

(both are imported from `google.adk.agents`

). They are identical - use whichever you prefer. This guide uses `Agent`

for brevity, but you may see `LlmAgent`

in other ADK documentation and examples.

#### Define Your SessionService[¶](#define-your-sessionservice)

The ADK [Session](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/session/) manages conversation state and history across streaming sessions. It stores and retrieves session data, enabling features like conversation resumption and context persistence.

To create a `Session`

, or get an existing one for a specified `session_id`

, every ADK application needs to have a [SessionService](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/session/#managing-sessions-with-a-sessionservice). For development purpose, ADK provides a simple `InMemorySessionService`

that will lose the `Session`

state when the application shuts down.

[main.py:37](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L37)

from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
# Define your session service
session_service = InMemorySessionService()


For production applications, choose a persistent session service based on your infrastructure:

**Use DatabaseSessionService if:**

- You need persistent storage with SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
- You're building single-server apps (SQLite) or multi-server deployments (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- You want full control over data storage and backups
- Examples:
- SQLite:
`DatabaseSessionService(db_url="sqlite:///./sessions.db")`

- PostgreSQL:
`DatabaseSessionService(db_url="postgresql://user:pass@host/db")`


- SQLite:

**Use VertexAiSessionService if:**

- You're already using Google Cloud Platform
- You want managed storage with built-in scalability
- You need tight integration with Vertex AI features
- Example:
`VertexAiSessionService(project="my-project")`


Both provide session persistence capabilities—choose based on your infrastructure and scale requirements. With persistent session services, the state of the `Session`

will be preserved even after application shutdown. See the [ADK Session Management documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/) for more details.

#### Define Your Runner[¶](#define-your-runner)

The [Runner](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/runtime/) provides the runtime for the `Agent`

. It manages the conversation flow, coordinates tool execution, handles events, and integrates with session storage. You create one runner instance at application startup and reuse it for all streaming sessions.

[main.py:50,53](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L50)

from google.adk.runners import Runner
APP_NAME = "bidi-demo"
# Define your runner
runner = Runner(
app_name=APP_NAME,
agent=agent,
session_service=session_service
)


The `app_name`

parameter is required and identifies your application in session storage. All sessions for your application are organized under this name.

### Phase 2: Session Initialization[¶](#phase-2-session-initialization)

#### Get or Create Session[¶](#get-or-create-session)

ADK `Session`

provides a "conversation thread" of the Bidi-streaming application. Just like you wouldn't start every text message from scratch, agents need context regarding the ongoing interaction. `Session`

is the ADK object designed specifically to track and manage these individual conversation threads.

##### ADK `Session`

vs Live API session[¶](#adk-session-vs-live-api-session)

ADK `Session`

(managed by SessionService) provides **persistent conversation storage** across multiple Bidi-streaming sessions (can spans hours, days or even months), while Live API session (managed by Live API backend) is **a transient streaming context** that exists only during single Bidi-streaming event loop (spans minutes or hours typically) that we will discuss later. When the loop starts, ADK initializes the Live API session with history from the ADK `Session`

, then updates the ADK `Session`

as new events occur.

For a detailed comparison with sequence diagrams, see [Part 4: ADK Session vs Live API session](../part4/#adk-session-vs-live-api-session).

##### Session Identifiers Are Application-Defined[¶](#session-identifiers-are-application-defined)

Sessions are identified by three parameters: `app_name`

, `user_id`

, and `session_id`

. This three-level hierarchy enables multi-tenant applications where each user can have multiple concurrent sessions.

Both `user_id`

and `session_id`

are **arbitrary string identifiers** that you define based on your application's needs. ADK performs no format validation beyond `.strip()`

on `session_id`

—you can use any string values that make sense for your application:

: User UUIDs (`user_id`

examples`"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`

), email addresses (`"alice@example.com"`

), database IDs (`"user_12345"`

), or simple identifiers (`"demo-user"`

): Custom session tokens, UUIDs, timestamp-based IDs (`session_id`

examples`"session_2025-01-27_143022"`

), or simple identifiers (`"demo-session"`

)

**Auto-generation**: If you pass `session_id=None`

or an empty string to `create_session()`

, ADK automatically generates a UUID for you (e.g., `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`

).

**Organizational hierarchy**: These identifiers organize sessions in a three-level structure:

This design enables scenarios like:

- Multi-tenant applications where different users have isolated conversation spaces
- Single users with multiple concurrent chat threads (e.g., different topics)
- Per-device or per-browser session isolation

##### Recommended Pattern: Get-or-Create[¶](#recommended-pattern-get-or-create)

The recommended production pattern is to check if a session exists first, then create it only if needed. This approach safely handles both new sessions and conversation resumption:

[main.py:155-161](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L155-L161)

# Get or create session (handles both new sessions and reconnections)
session = await session_service.get_session(
app_name=APP_NAME,
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id
)
if not session:
await session_service.create_session(
app_name=APP_NAME,
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id
)


This pattern works correctly in all scenarios:

**New conversations**: If the session doesn't exist, it's created automatically**Resuming conversations**: If the session already exists (e.g., reconnection after network interruption), the existing session is reused with full conversation history**Idempotent**: Safe to call multiple times without errors

**Important**: The session must exist before calling `runner.run_live()`

with the same identifiers. If the session doesn't exist, `run_live()`

will raise `ValueError: Session not found`

.

#### Create RunConfig[¶](#create-runconfig)

[RunConfig](../part4/) defines the streaming behavior for this specific session—which modalities to use (text or audio), whether to enable transcription, voice activity detection, proactivity, and other advanced features.

[main.py:110-124](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L110-L124)

from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode
from google.genai import types
# Native audio models require AUDIO response modality with audio transcription
response_modalities = ["AUDIO"]
run_config = RunConfig(
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI,
response_modalities=response_modalities,
input_audio_transcription=types.AudioTranscriptionConfig(),
output_audio_transcription=types.AudioTranscriptionConfig(),
session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)


`RunConfig`

is **session-specific**—each streaming session can have different configuration. For example, one user might prefer text-only responses while another uses voice mode. See [Part 4: Understanding RunConfig](../part4/) for complete configuration options.

#### Create LiveRequestQueue[¶](#create-liverequestqueue)

`LiveRequestQueue`

is the communication channel for sending messages to the agent during streaming. It's a thread-safe async queue that buffers user messages (text content, audio blobs, activity signals) for orderly processing.

[main.py:163](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L163)

from google.adk.agents.live_request_queue import LiveRequestQueue
live_request_queue = LiveRequestQueue()


`LiveRequestQueue`

is **session-specific and stateful**—you create a new queue for each streaming session and close it when the session ends. Unlike `Agent`

and `Runner`

, queues cannot be reused across sessions.

One Queue Per Session

Never reuse a `LiveRequestQueue`

across multiple streaming sessions. Each call to `run_live()`

requires a fresh queue. Reusing queues can cause message ordering issues and state corruption.

The close signal persists in the queue (see [ live_request_queue.py:59-60](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fd2c0f556b786417a9f6add744827b07e7a06b7d/src/google/adk/agents/live_request_queue.py#L66-L67)) and terminates the sender loop (see

[). Reusing a queue would carry over this signal and any remaining messages from the previous session.](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/fd2c0f556b786417a9f6add744827b07e7a06b7d/src/google/adk/flows/llm_flows/base_llm_flow.py#L260-L262)

`base_llm_flow.py:264-266`

### Phase 3: Bidi-streaming with `run_live()`

event loop[¶](#phase-3-bidi-streaming-with-run_live-event-loop)

Once the streaming loop is running, you can send messages to the agent and receive responses **concurrently**—this is Bidi-streaming in action. The agent can be generating a response while you're sending new input, enabling natural interruption-based conversation.

#### Send Messages to the Agent[¶](#send-messages-to-the-agent)

Use `LiveRequestQueue`

methods to send different types of messages to the agent during the streaming session:

[main.py:169-217](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L169-L217)

from google.genai import types
# Send text content
content = types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text=json_message["text"])])
live_request_queue.send_content(content)
# Send audio blob
audio_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data=audio_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)


These methods are **non-blocking**—they immediately add messages to the queue without waiting for processing. This enables smooth, responsive user experiences even during heavy AI processing.

See [Part 2: Sending messages with LiveRequestQueue](../part2/) for detailed API documentation.

#### Receive and Process Events[¶](#receive-and-process-events)

The `run_live()`

async generator continuously yields `Event`

objects as the agent processes input and generates responses. Each event represents a discrete occurrence—partial text generation, audio chunks, tool execution, transcription, interruption, or turn completion.

[main.py:219-234](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L219-L234)

async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
event_json = event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
await websocket.send_text(event_json)


Events are designed for **streaming delivery**—you receive partial responses as they're generated, not just complete messages. This enables real-time UI updates and responsive user experiences.

See [Part 3: Event handling with run_live()](../part3/) for comprehensive event handling patterns.

### Phase 4: Terminate Live API session[¶](#phase-4-terminate-live-api-session)

When the streaming session should end (user disconnects, conversation completes, timeout occurs), close the queue gracefully to signal termination to terminate the Live API session.

#### Close the Queue[¶](#close-the-queue)

Send a close signal through the queue to terminate the streaming loop:

[main.py:253](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L253)

live_request_queue.close()


This signals `run_live()`

to stop yielding events and exit the async generator loop. The agent completes any in-progress processing and the streaming session ends cleanly.

### FastAPI Application Example[¶](#fastapi-application-example)

Here's a complete FastAPI WebSocket application showing all four phases integrated with proper Bidi-streaming. The key pattern is **upstream/downstream tasks**: the upstream task receives messages from WebSocket and sends them to `LiveRequestQueue`

, while the downstream task receives `Event`

objects from `run_live()`

and sends them to WebSocket.

Async Context Required

All ADK bidirectional streaming applications **must run in an async context**. This requirement comes from multiple components:

: ADK's streaming method is an async generator with no synchronous wrapper (unlike`run_live()`

`run()`

)**Session operations**:`get_session()`

and`create_session()`

are async methods**WebSocket operations**: FastAPI's`websocket.accept()`

,`receive_text()`

, and`send_text()`

are all async**Concurrent tasks**: The upstream/downstream pattern requires`asyncio.gather()`

for concurrent execution

All code examples in this guide assume you're running in an async context (e.g., within an async function or coroutine). For consistency with ADK's official documentation patterns, examples show the core logic without boilerplate wrapper functions.

### Key Concepts[¶](#key-concepts)

**Upstream Task (WebSocket → LiveRequestQueue)**

The upstream task continuously receives messages from the WebSocket client and forwards them to the `LiveRequestQueue`

. This enables the user to send messages to the agent at any time, even while the agent is generating a response.

[main.py:169-217](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L169-L217)

async def upstream_task() -> None:
"""Receives messages from WebSocket and sends to LiveRequestQueue."""
try:
while True:
data: str = await websocket.receive_text()
content = types.Content(parts=[types.Part(text=data)])
live_request_queue.send_content(content)
except WebSocketDisconnect:
pass # Client disconnected


**Downstream Task (run_live() → WebSocket)**

The downstream task continuously receives `Event`

objects from `run_live()`

and sends them to the WebSocket client. This streams the agent's responses, tool executions, transcriptions, and other events to the user in real-time.

[main.py:219-234](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L219-L234)

async def downstream_task() -> None:
"""Receives Events from run_live() and sends to WebSocket."""
async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
await websocket.send_text(
event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
)


**Concurrent Execution with Cleanup**

Both tasks run concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`

, enabling true Bidi-streaming. The `try/finally`

block ensures `LiveRequestQueue.close()`

is called even if exceptions occur, minimizing the session resource usage.

[main.py:238-253](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L238-L253)

try:
await asyncio.gather(
upstream_task(),
downstream_task(),
return_exceptions=True
)
finally:
live_request_queue.close() # Always cleanup


This pattern—concurrent upstream/downstream tasks with guaranteed cleanup—is the foundation of production-ready streaming applications. The lifecycle pattern (initialize once, stream many times) enables efficient resource usage and clean separation of concerns, with application components remaining stateless and reusable while session-specific state is isolated in `LiveRequestQueue`

, `RunConfig`

, and session records.

#### Production Considerations[¶](#production-considerations)

This example shows the core pattern. For production applications, consider:

**Error handling (ADK)**: Add proper error handling for ADK streaming events. For details on error event handling, see[Part 3: Error Events](../part3/#error-events).- Handle task cancellation gracefully by catching
`asyncio.CancelledError`

during shutdown - Check exceptions from
`asyncio.gather()`

with`return_exceptions=True`

- exceptions don't propagate automatically

- Handle task cancellation gracefully by catching
**Error handling (Web)**: Handle web application-specific errors in upstream/downstream tasks. For example, with FastAPI you would need to:- Catch
`WebSocketDisconnect`

(client disconnected),`ConnectionClosedError`

(connection lost), and`RuntimeError`

(sending to closed connection) - Validate WebSocket connection state before sending with
`websocket.client_state`

to prevent errors when the connection is closed

- Catch
**Authentication and authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization for your endpoints**Rate limiting and quotas**: Add rate limiting and timeout controls. For guidance on concurrent sessions and quota management, see[Part 4: Concurrent Live API Sessions and Quota Management](../part4/#concurrent-live-api-sessions-and-quota-management).**Structured logging**: Use structured logging for debugging.**Persistent session services**: Consider using persistent session services (`DatabaseSessionService`

or`VertexAiSessionService`

). See the[ADK Session Services documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/)for more details.

## 1.6 What We Will Learn[¶](#16-what-we-will-learn)

This guide takes you through ADK's Bidi-streaming architecture step by step, following the natural flow of streaming applications: how messages travel upstream from users to agents, how events flow downstream from agents to users, how to configure session behaviors, and how to implement multimodal features. Each part focuses on a specific component of the streaming architecture with practical patterns you can apply immediately:

### Prerequisites and Learning Resources[¶](#prerequisites-and-learning-resources)

For building an ADK Bidi-streaming application in production, we recommend having basic knowledge of the following technologies:

Google's production-ready framework for building AI agents with streaming capabilities. ADK provides high-level abstractions for session management, tool orchestration, and state persistence, eliminating the need to implement low-level streaming infrastructure from scratch.

**Live API ( Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API)**

Google's real-time conversational AI technology that enables low-latency bidirectional streaming with Gemini models. The Live API provides the underlying WebSocket-based protocol that powers ADK's streaming capabilities, handling multimodal input/output and natural conversation flow.

Python's built-in support for asynchronous programming using `async`

/`await`

syntax and the `asyncio`

library. ADK streaming is built on async generators and coroutines, requiring familiarity with concepts like async functions, awaiting tasks, and concurrent execution with `asyncio.gather()`

.

A Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. ADK uses Pydantic models extensively for structured data (like `Event`

, `RunConfig`

, and `Content`

), providing type safety, automatic validation, and JSON serialization via `.model_dump_json()`

.

A modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation. FastAPI's native support for WebSockets and async request handling makes it ideal for building ADK streaming endpoints. FastAPI is included in the `adk-python`

package and used by ADK's `adk web`

tool for rapid prototyping. Alternative frameworks with WebSocket support (like Flask-SocketIO or Starlette) can also be used.

A protocol providing full-duplex (two-way) communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSockets enable real-time bidirectional data flow between clients and servers, making them the standard transport for streaming applications. Unlike HTTP request-response, WebSocket connections persist, allowing both parties to send messages at any time.

A standard for servers to push data to web clients over HTTP. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is unidirectional (server-to-client only), making it simpler but less flexible. SSE is useful for streaming agent responses when you don't need client-to-server streaming, such as when user input comes through separate HTTP POST requests.

While this guide covers ADK-specific concepts thoroughly, familiarity with these underlying technologies will help you build more robust production applications.

## Summary[¶](#summary)

In this introduction, you learned how ADK transforms complex real-time streaming infrastructure into a developer-friendly framework. We covered the fundamentals of Live API's bidirectional streaming capabilities, examined how ADK simplifies the streaming complexity through abstractions like `LiveRequestQueue`

, `Runner`

, and `run_live()`

, and explored the complete application lifecycle from initialization through session termination. You now understand how ADK handles the heavy lifting—LLM-side streaming connection management, state persistence, platform differences, and event coordination—so you can focus on building intelligent agent experiences. With this foundation in place, you're ready to dive into the specifics of sending messages, handling events, configuring sessions, and implementing multimodal features in the following parts.

# Part 3: Event handling with run_live()¶

# Part 3: Event handling with run_live()[¶](#part-3-event-handling-with-run_live)

The `run_live()`

method is ADK's primary entry point for streaming conversations, implementing an async generator that yields events as the conversation unfolds. This part focuses on understanding and handling these events—the core communication mechanism that enables real-time interaction between your application, users, and AI models.

You'll learn how to process different event types (text, audio, transcriptions, tool calls), manage conversation flow with interruption and turn completion signals, serialize events for network transport, and leverage ADK's automatic tool execution. Understanding event handling is essential for building responsive streaming applications that feel natural and real-time to users.

Async Context Required

All `run_live()`

code requires async context. See [Part 1: FastAPI Application Example](../part1/#fastapi-application-example) for details and production examples.

## How run_live() Works[¶](#how-run_live-works)

`run_live()`

is an async generator that streams conversation events in real-time. It yields events immediately as they're generated—no buffering, no polling, no callbacks. Events are streamed without internal buffering. Overall memory depends on session persistence (e.g., in-memory vs database), making it suitable for both quick exchanges and extended sessions.

### Method Signature and Flow[¶](#method-signature-and-flow)

**Usage:**

[runners.py](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/29c1115959b0084ac1169748863b35323da3cf50/src/google/adk/runners.py)

# The method signature reveals the thoughtful design
async def run_live(
self,
*, # Keyword-only arguments
user_id: Optional[str] = None, # User identification (required unless session provided)
session_id: Optional[str] = None, # Session tracking (required unless session provided)
live_request_queue: LiveRequestQueue, # The bidirectional communication channel
run_config: Optional[RunConfig] = None, # Streaming behavior configuration
session: Optional[Session] = None, # Deprecated: use user_id and session_id instead
) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]: # Generator yielding conversation events


As its signature tells, every streaming conversation needs identity (user_id), continuity (session_id), communication (live_request_queue), and configuration (run_config). The return type—an async generator of Events—promises real-time delivery without overwhelming system resources.

```

LLMFlow-->>Agent: Event
Agent-->>Runner: Event
Runner-->>Client: Event (yield)
end
```


### Basic Usage Pattern[¶](#basic-usage-pattern)

The simplest way to consume events from `run_live()`

is to iterate over the async generator with a for-loop:

[main.py:225-233](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L225-L233)

async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
event_json = event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
logger.debug(f"[SERVER] Event: {event_json}")
await websocket.send_text(event_json)


Session Identifiers

Both `user_id`

and `session_id`

must match the identifiers you used when creating the session via `SessionService.create_session()`

. These can be any string values based on your application's needs (e.g., UUIDs, email addresses, custom tokens). See [Part 1: Get or Create Session](../part1/#get-or-create-session) for detailed guidance on session identifiers.

### Connection Lifecycle in run_live()[¶](#connection-lifecycle-in-run_live)

The `run_live()`

method manages the underlying Live API connection lifecycle automatically:

**Connection States:**
1. **Initialization**: Connection established when `run_live()`

is called
2. **Active Streaming**: Bidirectional communication via `LiveRequestQueue`

(upstream to the model) and `run_live()`

(downstream from the model)
3. **Graceful Closure**: Connection closes when `LiveRequestQueue.close()`

is called
4. **Error Recovery**: ADK supports transparent session resumption; enable via `RunConfig.session_resumption`

to handle transient failures. See [Part 4: Live API Session Resumption](../part4/#live-api-session-resumption) for details.

#### What run_live() Yields[¶](#what-run_live-yields)

The `run_live()`

method yields a stream of `Event`

objects in real-time as the agent processes user input and generates responses. Understanding the different event types helps you build responsive UIs that handle text, audio, transcriptions, tool calls, metadata, and errors appropriately. Each event type is explained in detail in the sections below.

| Event Type | Description |
|---|---|
|
Model's text responses when using `response_modalities=["TEXT"]` ; includes `partial` , `turn_complete` , and `interrupted` flags for streaming UI management |
|
Raw audio bytes (`inline_data` ) streamed in real-time when using `response_modalities=["AUDIO"]` ; ephemeral (not persisted to session) |
|
Audio aggregated into files and stored in artifacts; contains `file_data` references instead of raw bytes; can be persisted to session history |
|
Token usage information (`prompt_token_count` , `candidates_token_count` , `total_token_count` ) for cost monitoring and quota tracking |
|
Speech-to-text for user input (`input_transcription` ) and model output (`output_transcription` ) when transcription is enabled in `RunConfig` |
|
Function call requests from the model; ADK handles execution automatically |
|
Model errors and connection issues with `error_code` and `error_message` fields |

Source Reference

See the complete event type handling implementation in `runners.py`


#### When run_live() Exits[¶](#when-run_live-exits)

The `run_live()`

event loop can exit under various conditions. Understanding these exit scenarios is crucial for proper resource cleanup and error handling:

| Exit Condition | Trigger | Graceful? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Manual close |
`live_request_queue.close()` |
✅ Yes | User explicitly closes the queue, sending `LiveRequest(close=True)` signal |
All agents complete |
Last agent in SequentialAgent calls `task_completed()` |
✅ Yes | After all sequential agents finish their tasks |
Session timeout |
Live API duration limit reached | ⚠️ Connection closed | Session exceeds maximum duration (see limits below) |
Early exit |
`end_invocation` flag set |
✅ Yes | Set during preprocessing or by tools/callbacks to terminate early |
Empty event |
Queue closure signal | ✅ Yes | Internal signal indicating event stream has ended |
Errors |
Connection errors, exceptions | ❌ No | Unhandled exceptions or connection failures |

SequentialAgent Behavior

When using `SequentialAgent`

, the `task_completed()`

function does NOT exit your application's `run_live()`

loop. It only signals the end of the current agent's work, triggering a seamless transition to the next agent in the sequence. Your event loop continues receiving events from subsequent agents. The loop only exits when the **last** agent in the sequence completes.

For session resumption and connection recovery details, see [Part 4: Live API Session Resumption](../part4/#live-api-session-resumption). For multi-agent workflows, see [Best Practices for Multi-Agent Workflows](#best-practices-for-multi-agent-workflows).

#### Events Saved to ADK `Session`

[¶](#events-saved-to-adk-session)

Not all events yielded by `run_live()`

are persisted to the ADK `Session`

. When `run_live()`

exits, only certain events are saved to the session while others remain ephemeral. Understanding which events are saved versus which are ephemeral is crucial for applications that use session persistence, resumption, or need to review conversation history.

Source Reference

See session event persistence logic in `runners.py`


**Events Saved to the ADK Session:**

These events are persisted to the ADK `Session`

and available in session history:

**Audio Events with File Data**: Saved to ADK`Session`

only if`RunConfig.save_live_blob`

is`True`

; audio data is aggregated into files in artifacts with`file_data`

references**Usage Metadata Events**: Always saved to track token consumption across the ADK`Session`

**Non-Partial Transcription Events**: Final transcriptions are saved; partial transcriptions are not persisted**Function Call and Response Events**: Always saved to maintain tool execution history**Other Control Events**: Most control events (e.g.,`turn_complete`

,`finish_reason`

) are saved

**Events NOT Saved to the ADK Session:**

These events are ephemeral and only yielded to callers during active streaming:

**Audio Events with Inline Data**: Raw audio`Blob`

data in`inline_data`

is never saved to the ADK`Session`

(only yielded for real-time playback)**Partial Transcription Events**: Only yielded for real-time display; final transcriptions are saved

Audio Persistence

To save audio conversations to the ADK `Session`

for review or resumption, enable `RunConfig.save_live_blob = True`

. This persists audio streams to artifacts. See [Part 4: save_live_blob](../part4/#save_live_blob) for configuration details.

## Understanding Events[¶](#understanding-events)

Events are the core communication mechanism in ADK's Bidi-streaming system. This section explores the complete lifecycle of events—from how they're generated through multiple pipeline layers, to concurrent processing patterns that enable true real-time interaction, to practical handling of interruptions and turn completion. You'll learn about event types (text, audio, transcriptions, tool calls), serialization strategies for network transport, and the connection lifecycle that manages streaming sessions across both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API platforms.

### The Event Class[¶](#the-event-class)

ADK's `Event`

class is a Pydantic model that represents all communication in a streaming conversation. It extends `LlmResponse`

and serves as the unified container for model responses, user input, transcriptions, and control signals.

Source Reference

See Event class implementation in [ event.py:30-128](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/29c1115959b0084ac1169748863b35323da3cf50/src/google/adk/events/event.py#L30-L128) and


`llm_response.py:28-200`

#### Key Fields[¶](#key-fields)

**Essential for all applications:**
- `content`

: Contains text, audio, or function calls as `Content.parts`

- `author`

: Identifies who created the event (`"user"`

or agent name)
- `partial`

: Distinguishes incremental chunks from complete text
- `turn_complete`

: Signals when to enable user input again
- `interrupted`

: Indicates when to stop rendering current output

**For voice/audio applications:**
- `input_transcription`

: User's spoken words (when enabled in `RunConfig`

)
- `output_transcription`

: Model's spoken words (when enabled in `RunConfig`

)
- `content.parts[].inline_data`

: Audio data for playback

**For tool execution:**
- `content.parts[].function_call`

: Model's tool invocation requests
- `content.parts[].function_response`

: Tool execution results
- `long_running_tool_ids`

: Track async tool execution

**For debugging and diagnostics:**
- `usage_metadata`

: Token counts and billing information
- `cache_metadata`

: Context cache hit/miss statistics
- `finish_reason`

: Why the model stopped generating (e.g., STOP, MAX_TOKENS, SAFETY)
- `error_code`

/ `error_message`

: Failure diagnostics

Author Semantics

Transcription events have author `"user"`

; model responses/events use the agent's name as `author`

(not `"model"`

). See [Event Authorship](#event-authorship) for details.

#### Understanding Event Identity[¶](#understanding-event-identity)

Events have two important ID fields:

: Unique identifier for this specific event (format: UUID). Each event gets a new ID, even partial text chunks.`event.id`

: Shared identifier for all events in the current invocation (format:`event.invocation_id`

`"e-" + UUID`

). In`run_live()`

, all events from a single streaming session share the same invocation_id. (See[InvocationContext](#invocationcontext-the-execution-state-container)for more about invocations)

**Usage:**

# All events in this streaming session will have the same invocation_id
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
print(f"Event ID: {event.id}") # Unique per event
print(f"Invocation ID: {event.invocation_id}") # Same for all events in session


**Use cases:**
- **event.id**: Track individual events in logs, deduplicate events
- **event.invocation_id**: Group events by conversation session, filter session-specific events

### Event Authorship[¶](#event-authorship)

In live streaming mode, the `Event.author`

field follows special semantics to maintain conversation clarity:

**Model responses**: Authored by the **agent name** (e.g., `"my_agent"`

), not the literal string `"model"`


- This enables multi-agent scenarios where you need to track which agent generated the response
- Example:
`Event(author="customer_service_agent", content=...)`


**User transcriptions**: Authored as `"user"`

when the event contains transcribed user audio

**How it works**:

- Gemini Live API returns user audio transcriptions with
`content.role == 'user'`

- ADK's
`get_author_for_event()`

function checks for this role marker - If
`content.role == 'user'`

, ADK sets`Event.author`

to`"user"`

- Otherwise, ADK sets
`Event.author`

to the agent name (e.g.,`"my_agent"`

)

This transformation ensures that transcribed user input is correctly attributed to the user in your application's conversation history, even though it flows through the model's response stream.

- Example: Input audio transcription →
`Event(author="user", input_transcription=..., content.role="user")`


**Why this matters**:

- In multi-agent applications, you can filter events by agent:
`events = [e for e in stream if e.author == "my_agent"]`

- When displaying conversation history, use
`event.author`

to show who said what - Transcription events are correctly attributed to the user even though they flow through the model

Source Reference

See author attribution logic in `base_llm_flow.py:292-326`


### Event Types and Handling[¶](#event-types-and-handling)

ADK streams distinct event types through `runner.run_live()`

to support different interaction modalities: text responses for traditional chat, audio chunks for voice output, transcriptions for accessibility and logging, and tool call notifications for function execution. Each event includes metadata flags (`partial`

, `turn_complete`

, `interrupted`

) that control UI state transitions and enable natural, human-like conversation flows. Understanding how to recognize and handle these event types is essential for building responsive streaming applications.

### Text Events[¶](#text-events)

The most common event type, containing the model's text responses when you specify `response_modalities`

in `RunConfig`

to `["TEXT"]`

mode:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.content and event.content.parts:
if event.content.parts[0].text:
text = event.content.parts[0].text
if not event.partial:
# Your logic to update streaming display
update_streaming_display(text)


#### Default Response Modality Behavior[¶](#default-response-modality-behavior)

When `response_modalities`

is not explicitly set (i.e., `None`

), ADK automatically defaults to `["AUDIO"]`

mode at the start of `run_live()`

. This means:

**If you provide no RunConfig**: Defaults to`["AUDIO"]`

**If you provide RunConfig without response_modalities**: Defaults to`["AUDIO"]`

**If you explicitly set response_modalities**: Uses your setting (no default applied)

**Why this default exists**: Some native audio models require the response modality to be explicitly set. To ensure compatibility with all models, ADK defaults to `["AUDIO"]`

.

**For text-only applications**: Always explicitly set `response_modalities=["TEXT"]`

in your RunConfig to avoid receiving unexpected audio events.

**Example:**

# Explicit text mode
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["TEXT"],
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI
)


**Key Event Flags:**

These flags help you manage streaming text display and conversation flow in your UI:

`event.partial`

:`True`

for incremental text chunks during streaming;`False`

for complete merged text`event.turn_complete`

:`True`

when the model has finished its complete response`event.interrupted`

:`True`

when user interrupted the model's response

Learn More

For detailed guidance on using `partial`

`turn_complete`

and `interrupted`

flags to manage conversation flow and UI state, see [Handling Text Events](#handling-text-events).

### Audio Events[¶](#audio-events)

When `response_modalities`

is configured to `["AUDIO"]`

in your `RunConfig`

, the model generates audio output instead of text, and you'll receive audio data in the event stream:

**Configuration:**

# Configure RunConfig for audio responses
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI
)
# Audio arrives as inline_data in event.content.parts
async for event in runner.run_live(..., run_config=run_config):
if event.content and event.content.parts:
part = event.content.parts[0]
if part.inline_data:
# Audio event structure:
# part.inline_data.data: bytes (raw PCM audio)
# part.inline_data.mime_type: str (e.g., "audio/pcm")
audio_data = part.inline_data.data
mime_type = part.inline_data.mime_type
print(f"Received {len(audio_data)} bytes of {mime_type}")
# Your logic to play audio
await play_audio(audio_data)


Learn More

—you must choose either`response_modalities`

controls how the model generates output`["TEXT"]`

for text responses or`["AUDIO"]`

for audio responses per session. You cannot use both modalities simultaneously. See[Part 4: Response Modalities](../part4/#response-modalities)for configuration details.- For comprehensive coverage of audio formats, sending/receiving audio, and audio processing flow, see
[Part 5: How to Use Audio, Image and Video](../part5/).

### Audio Events with File Data[¶](#audio-events-with-file-data)

When audio data is aggregated and saved as files in artifacts, ADK yields events containing `file_data`

references instead of raw `inline_data`

. This is useful for persisting audio to session history.

Source Reference

See audio file aggregation logic in `audio_cache_manager.py:156-178`


**Receiving Audio File References:**

async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=queue,
run_config=run_config
):
if event.content and event.content.parts:
for part in event.content.parts:
if part.file_data:
# Audio aggregated into a file saved in artifacts
file_uri = part.file_data.file_uri
mime_type = part.file_data.mime_type
print(f"Audio file saved: {file_uri} ({mime_type})")
# Retrieve audio file from artifact service for playback


**File Data vs Inline Data:**

**Inline Data**(`part.inline_data`

): Raw audio bytes streamed in real-time; ephemeral and not saved to session**File Data**(`part.file_data`

): Reference to audio file stored in artifacts; can be persisted to session history

Both input and output audio data are aggregated into audio files and saved in the artifact service. The file reference is included in the event as `file_data`

, allowing you to retrieve the audio later.

Session Persistence

To save audio events with file data to session history, enable `RunConfig.save_live_blob = True`

. This allows audio conversations to be reviewed or replayed from persisted sessions.

### Metadata Events[¶](#metadata-events)

Usage metadata events contain token usage information for monitoring costs and quota consumption. The `run_live()`

method yields these events separately from content events.

Source Reference

See usage metadata structure in `llm_response.py:105`


**Accessing Token Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=queue,
run_config=run_config
):
if event.usage_metadata:
print(f"Prompt tokens: {event.usage_metadata.prompt_token_count}")
print(f"Response tokens: {event.usage_metadata.candidates_token_count}")
print(f"Total tokens: {event.usage_metadata.total_token_count}")
# Track cumulative usage across the session
total_tokens += event.usage_metadata.total_token_count or 0


**Available Metadata Fields:**

`prompt_token_count`

: Number of tokens in the input (prompt and context)`candidates_token_count`

: Number of tokens in the model's response`total_token_count`

: Sum of prompt and response tokens`cached_content_token_count`

: Number of tokens served from cache (when using context caching)

Cost Monitoring

Usage metadata events allow real-time cost tracking during streaming sessions. You can implement quota limits, display usage to users, or log metrics for billing and analytics.

### Transcription Events[¶](#transcription-events)

When transcription is enabled in `RunConfig`

, you receive transcriptions as separate events:

**Configuration:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# User's spoken words (when input_audio_transcription enabled)
if event.input_transcription:
# Your logic to display user transcription
display_user_transcription(event.input_transcription)
# Model's spoken words (when output_audio_transcription enabled)
if event.output_transcription:
# Your logic to display model transcription
display_model_transcription(event.output_transcription)


These enable accessibility features and conversation logging without separate transcription services.

Learn More

For details on enabling transcription in `RunConfig`

and understanding transcription delivery, see [Part 5: Audio Transcription](../part5/#audio-transcription).

### Tool Call Events[¶](#tool-call-events)

When the model requests tool execution:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.content and event.content.parts:
for part in event.content.parts:
if part.function_call:
# Model is requesting a tool execution

# ADK handles execution automatically


ADK processes tool calls automatically—you typically don't need to handle these directly unless implementing custom tool execution logic.

### Error Events[¶](#error-events)

Production applications need robust error handling to gracefully handle model errors and connection issues. ADK surfaces errors through the `error_code`

and `error_message`

fields:

**Usage:**

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
try:
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Handle errors from the model or connection
if event.error_code:
logger.error(f"Model error: {event.error_code} - {event.error_message}")
# Send error notification to client
await websocket.send_json({
"type": "error",
"code": event.error_code,
"message": event.error_message
})
# Decide whether to continue or break based on error severity
if event.error_code in ["SAFETY", "PROHIBITED_CONTENT", "BLOCKLIST"]:
# Content policy violations - usually cannot retry
break # Terminal error - exit loop
elif event.error_code == "MAX_TOKENS":
# Token limit reached - may need to adjust configuration
break
# For other errors, you might continue or implement retry logic
continue # Transient error - keep processing
# Normal event processing only if no error
if event.content and event.content.parts:
# ... handle content
pass
finally:
queue.close() # Always cleanup connection


Note

The above example shows the basic structure for checking `error_code`

and `error_message`

. For production-ready error handling with user notifications, retry logic, and context logging, see the real-world scenarios below.

**When to use break vs continue:**


The key decision is: *Can the model's response continue meaningfully?*

**Scenario 1: Content Policy Violation (Use break)**

You're building a customer support chatbot. A user asks an inappropriate question that triggers a SAFETY filter:

**Example:**

if event.error_code in ["SAFETY", "PROHIBITED_CONTENT", "BLOCKLIST"]:
# Model has stopped generating - continuation is impossible
await websocket.send_json({
"type": "error",
"message": "I can't help with that request. Please ask something else."
})
break # Exit loop - model won't send more events for this turn


**Why break?** The model has terminated its response. No more events will come for this turn. Continuing would just waste resources waiting for events that won't arrive.

**Scenario 2: Network Hiccup During Streaming (Use continue)**

You're building a voice transcription service. Midway through transcribing, there's a brief network glitch:

**Example:**

if event.error_code == "UNAVAILABLE":
# Temporary network issue
logger.warning(f"Network hiccup: {event.error_message}")
# Don't notify user for brief transient issues that may self-resolve
continue # Keep listening - model may recover and continue


**Why continue?** This is a transient error. The connection might recover, and the model may continue streaming the transcription. Breaking would prematurely end a potentially recoverable stream.

User Notifications

For brief transient errors (lasting <1 second), don't notify the user—they won't notice the hiccup. But if the error persists or impacts the user experience (e.g., streaming pauses for >3 seconds), notify them gracefully: "Experiencing connection issues, retrying..."

**Scenario 3: Token Limit Reached (Use break)**

You're generating a long-form article and hit the maximum token limit:

**Example:**

if event.error_code == "MAX_TOKENS":
# Model has reached output limit
await websocket.send_json({
"type": "complete",
"message": "Response reached maximum length",
"truncated": True
})
break # Model has finished - no more tokens will be generated


**Why break?** The model has reached its output limit and stopped. Continuing won't yield more tokens.

**Scenario 4: Rate Limit with Retry Logic (Use continue with backoff)**

You're running a high-traffic application that occasionally hits rate limits:

**Example:**

retry_count = 0
max_retries = 3
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.error_code == "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED":
retry_count += 1
if retry_count > max_retries:
logger.error("Max retries exceeded")
break # Give up after multiple failures
# Wait and retry
await asyncio.sleep(2 ** retry_count) # Exponential backoff
continue # Keep listening - rate limit may clear
# Reset counter on successful event
retry_count = 0


**Why continue (initially)?** Rate limits are often temporary. With exponential backoff, the stream may recover. But after multiple failures,

`break`

to avoid infinite waiting.**Decision Framework:**

| Error Type | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
`SAFETY` , `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` |
`break` |
Model terminated response |
`MAX_TOKENS` |
`break` |
Model finished generating |
`UNAVAILABLE` , `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` |
`continue` |
Transient network/timeout issue |
`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (rate limit) |
`continue` with retry logic |
May recover after brief wait |
| Unknown errors | `continue` (with logging) |
Err on side of caution |

**Critical: Always use finally for cleanup**

**Usage:**

try:
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# ... error handling ...
finally:
queue.close() # Cleanup runs whether you break or finish normally


Whether you `break`

or the loop finishes naturally, `finally`

ensures the connection closes properly.

**Error Code Reference:**

ADK error codes come from the underlying Gemini API. Here are the most common error codes you'll encounter:

| Error Code | Category | Description | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|
`SAFETY` |
Content Policy | Content violates safety policies | `break` - Inform user, log incident |
`PROHIBITED_CONTENT` |
Content Policy | Content contains prohibited material | `break` - Show policy violation message |
`BLOCKLIST` |
Content Policy | Content matches blocklist | `break` - Alert user, don't retry |
`MAX_TOKENS` |
Limits | Output reached maximum token limit | `break` - Truncate gracefully, summarize |
`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` |
Rate Limiting | Quota or rate limit exceeded | `continue` with backoff - Retry after delay |
`UNAVAILABLE` |
Transient | Service temporarily unavailable | `continue` - Retry, may self-resolve |
`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` |
Transient | Request timeout exceeded | `continue` - Consider retry with backoff |
`CANCELLED` |
Client | Client cancelled the request | `break` - Clean up resources |
`UNKNOWN` |
System | Unspecified error occurred | `continue` with logging - Log for analysis |

## Handling Text Events[¶](#handling-text-events)

Understanding the `partial`

, `interrupted`

, and `turn_complete`

flags is essential for building responsive streaming UIs. These flags enable you to provide real-time feedback during streaming, handle user interruptions gracefully, and detect conversation boundaries for proper state management.

### Handling `partial`

[¶](#handling-partial)

This flag helps you distinguish between incremental text chunks and complete merged text, enabling smooth streaming displays with proper final confirmation.

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.content and event.content.parts:
if event.content.parts[0].text:
text = event.content.parts[0].text
if event.partial:
# Your streaming UI update logic here
update_streaming_display(text)
else:
# Your complete message display logic here
display_complete_message(text)


`partial`

Flag Semantics:

`partial=True`

: The text in this event is**incremental**—it contains ONLY the new text since the last event`partial=False`

: The text in this event is**complete**—it contains the full merged text for this response segment

Note

The `partial`

flag is only meaningful for text content (`event.content.parts[].text`

). For other content types:

**Audio events**: Each audio chunk in`inline_data`

is independent (no merging occurs)**Tool calls**: Function calls and responses are always complete (partial doesn't apply)**Transcriptions**: Transcription events are always complete when yielded

**Example Stream:**

Event 1: partial=True, text="Hello", turn_complete=False
Event 2: partial=True, text=" world", turn_complete=False
Event 3: partial=False, text="Hello world", turn_complete=False
Event 4: partial=False, text="", turn_complete=True # Turn done


**Important timing relationships**:
- `partial=False`

can occur **multiple times** in a turn (e.g., after each sentence)
- `turn_complete=True`

occurs **once** at the very end of the model's complete response, in a **separate event**
- You may receive: `partial=False`

(sentence 1) → `partial=False`

(sentence 2) → `turn_complete=True`

- The merged text event (`partial=False`

with content) is always yielded **before** the `turn_complete=True`

event

Note

ADK internally accumulates all text from `partial=True`

events. When you receive an event with `partial=False`

, the text content equals the sum of all preceding `partial=True`

chunks. This means:

- You can safely ignore all
`partial=True`

events and only process`partial=False`

events if you don't need streaming display - If you do display
`partial=True`

events, the`partial=False`

event provides the complete merged text for validation or storage - This accumulation is handled automatically by ADK's
`StreamingResponseAggregator`

—you don't need to manually concatenate partial text chunks

#### Handling `interrupted`

Flag[¶](#handling-interrupted-flag)

This enables natural conversation flow by detecting when users interrupt the model mid-response, allowing you to stop rendering outdated content immediately.

When users send new input while the model is still generating a response (common in voice conversations), you'll receive an event with `interrupted=True`

:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.interrupted:
# Your logic to stop displaying partial text and clear typing indicators
stop_streaming_display()
# Your logic to show interruption in UI (optional)
show_user_interruption_indicator()


**Example - Interruption Scenario:**

Model: "The weather in San Francisco is currently..."
User: [interrupts] "Actually, I meant San Diego"
→ event.interrupted=True received
→ Your app: stop rendering model response, clear UI
→ Model processes new input
Model: "The weather in San Diego is..."


**When to use interruption handling:**

**Voice conversations**: Stop audio playback immediately when user starts speaking**Clear UI state**: Remove typing indicators and partial text displays**Conversation logging**: Mark which responses were interrupted (incomplete)**User feedback**: Show visual indication that interruption was recognized

#### Handling `turn_complete`

Flag[¶](#handling-turn_complete-flag)

This signals conversation boundaries, allowing you to update UI state (enable input controls, hide indicators) and mark proper turn boundaries in logs and analytics.

When the model finishes its complete response, you'll receive an event with `turn_complete=True`

:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
if event.turn_complete:
# Your logic to update UI to show "ready for input" state
enable_user_input()
# Your logic to hide typing indicator
hide_typing_indicator()
# Your logic to mark conversation boundary in logs
log_turn_boundary()


**Event Flag Combinations:**

Understanding how `turn_complete`

and `interrupted`

combine helps you handle all conversation states:

| Scenario | turn_complete | interrupted | Your App Should |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal completion | True | False | Enable input, show "ready" state |
| User interrupted mid-response | False | True | Stop display, clear partial content |
| Interrupted at end | True | True | Same as normal completion (turn is done) |
| Mid-response (partial text) | False | False | Continue displaying streaming text |

**Implementation:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Handle streaming text
if event.content and event.content.parts and event.content.parts[0].text:
if event.partial:
# Your logic to show typing indicator and update partial text
update_streaming_text(event.content.parts[0].text)
else:
# Your logic to display complete text chunk
display_text(event.content.parts[0].text)
# Handle interruption
if event.interrupted:
# Your logic to stop audio playback and clear indicators
stop_audio_playback()
clear_streaming_indicators()
# Handle turn completion
if event.turn_complete:
# Your logic to enable user input
show_input_ready_state()
enable_microphone()


**Common Use Cases:**

**UI state management**: Show/hide "ready for input" indicators, typing animations, microphone states**Audio playback control**: Know when to stop rendering audio chunks from the model**Conversation logging**: Mark clear boundaries between turns for history/analytics**Streaming optimization**: Stop buffering when turn is complete

**Turn completion and caching:** Audio/transcript caches are flushed automatically at specific points during streaming:
- **On turn completion** (`turn_complete=True`

): Both user and model audio caches are flushed
- **On interruption** (`interrupted=True`

): Model audio cache is flushed
- **On generation completion**: Model audio cache is flushed

## Serializing Events to JSON[¶](#serializing-events-to-json)

ADK `Event`

objects are Pydantic models, which means they come with powerful serialization capabilities. The `model_dump_json()`

method is particularly useful for streaming events over network protocols like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Using event.model_dump_json()[¶](#using-eventmodel_dump_json)

This provides a simple one-liner to convert ADK events into JSON format that can be sent over network protocols like WebSockets or SSE.

The `model_dump_json()`

method serializes an `Event`

object to a JSON string:

[main.py:219-234](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L219-L234)

async def downstream_task() -> None:
"""Receives Events from run_live() and sends to WebSocket."""
async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
event_json = event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
await websocket.send_text(event_json)


**What gets serialized:**

- Event metadata (author, server_content fields)
- Content (text, audio data, function calls)
- Event flags (partial, turn_complete, interrupted)
- Transcription data (input_transcription, output_transcription)
- Tool execution information

**When to use model_dump_json():**

- ✅ Streaming events over network (WebSocket, SSE)
- ✅ Logging/persistence to JSON files
- ✅ Debugging and inspection
- ✅ Integration with JSON-based APIs

**When NOT to use it:**

- ❌ In-memory processing (use event objects directly)
- ❌ High-frequency events where serialization overhead matters
- ❌ When you only need a few fields (extract them directly instead)

Performance Warning

Binary audio data in `event.content.parts[].inline_data`

will be base64-encoded when serialized to JSON, significantly increasing payload size (~133% overhead). For production applications with audio, send binary data separately using WebSocket binary frames or multipart HTTP. See [Optimization for Audio Transmission](#optimization-for-audio-transmission) for details.

### Serialization options[¶](#serialization-options)

This allows you to reduce payload sizes by excluding unnecessary fields, improving network performance and client processing speed.

Pydantic's `model_dump_json()`

supports several useful parameters:

**Usage:**

# Exclude None values for smaller payloads (with camelCase field names)
event_json = event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
# Custom exclusions (e.g., skip large binary audio)
event_json = event.model_dump_json(
exclude={'content': {'parts': {'__all__': {'inline_data'}}}},
by_alias=True
)
# Include only specific fields
event_json = event.model_dump_json(
include={'content', 'author', 'turn_complete', 'interrupted'},
by_alias=True
)
# Pretty-printed JSON (for debugging)
event_json = event.model_dump_json(indent=2, by_alias=True)


The bidi-demo uses `exclude_none=True`

to minimize payload size by omitting fields with None values.

### Deserializing on the Client[¶](#deserializing-on-the-client)

This shows how to parse and handle serialized events on the client side, enabling responsive UI updates based on event properties like turn completion and interruptions.

On the client side (JavaScript/TypeScript), parse the JSON back to objects:

[app.js:339-688](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L341-L690)

// Handle incoming messages
websocket.onmessage = function (event) {
// Parse the incoming ADK Event
const adkEvent = JSON.parse(event.data);
// Handle turn complete event
if (adkEvent.turnComplete === true) {
// Remove typing indicator from current message
if (currentBubbleElement) {
const textElement = currentBubbleElement.querySelector(".bubble-text");
const typingIndicator = textElement.querySelector(".typing-indicator");
if (typingIndicator) {
typingIndicator.remove();
}
}
currentMessageId = null;
currentBubbleElement = null;
return;
}
// Handle interrupted event
if (adkEvent.interrupted === true) {
// Stop audio playback if it's playing
if (audioPlayerNode) {
audioPlayerNode.port.postMessage({ command: "endOfAudio" });
}
// Keep the partial message but mark it as interrupted
if (currentBubbleElement) {
const textElement = currentBubbleElement.querySelector(".bubble-text");
// Remove typing indicator
const typingIndicator = textElement.querySelector(".typing-indicator");
if (typingIndicator) {
typingIndicator.remove();
}
// Add interrupted marker
currentBubbleElement.classList.add("interrupted");
}
currentMessageId = null;
currentBubbleElement = null;
return;
}
// Handle content events (text or audio)
if (adkEvent.content && adkEvent.content.parts) {
const parts = adkEvent.content.parts;
for (const part of parts) {
// Handle text
if (part.text) {
// Add a new message bubble for a new turn
if (currentMessageId == null) {
currentMessageId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
currentBubbleElement = createMessageBubble(part.text, false, true);
currentBubbleElement.id = currentMessageId;
messagesDiv.appendChild(currentBubbleElement);
} else {
// Update the existing message bubble with accumulated text
const existingText = currentBubbleElement.querySelector(".bubble-text").textContent;
const cleanText = existingText.replace(/\.\.\.$/, '');
updateMessageBubble(currentBubbleElement, cleanText + part.text, true);
}
scrollToBottom();
}
}
}
};


Demo Implementation

See the complete WebSocket message handler in `app.js:339-688`


### Optimization for Audio Transmission[¶](#optimization-for-audio-transmission)

Base64-encoded binary audio in JSON significantly increases payload size. For production applications, use a single WebSocket connection with both binary frames (for audio) and text frames (for metadata):

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Check for binary audio
has_audio = (
event.content and
event.content.parts and
any(p.inline_data for p in event.content.parts)
)
if has_audio:
# Send audio via binary WebSocket frame
for part in event.content.parts:
if part.inline_data:
await websocket.send_bytes(part.inline_data.data)
# Send metadata only (much smaller)
metadata_json = event.model_dump_json(
exclude={'content': {'parts': {'__all__': {'inline_data'}}}},
by_alias=True
)
await websocket.send_text(metadata_json)
else:
# Text-only events can be sent as JSON
await websocket.send_text(event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True))


This approach reduces bandwidth by ~75% for audio-heavy streams while maintaining full event metadata.

## Automatic Tool Execution in run_live()[¶](#automatic-tool-execution-in-run_live)

Source Reference

See automatic tool execution implementation in `functions.py`


One of the most powerful features of ADK's `run_live()`

is **automatic tool execution**. Unlike the raw Gemini Live API, which requires you to manually handle tool calls and responses, ADK abstracts this complexity entirely.

### The Challenge with Raw Live API[¶](#the-challenge-with-raw-live-api)

When using the Gemini Live API directly (without ADK), tool use requires manual orchestration:

**Receive**function calls from the model**Execute**the tools yourself**Format**function responses correctly**Send**responses back to the model

This creates significant implementation overhead, especially in streaming contexts where you need to handle multiple concurrent tool calls, manage errors, and coordinate with ongoing audio/text streams.

### How ADK Simplifies Tool Use[¶](#how-adk-simplifies-tool-use)

With ADK, tool execution becomes declarative. Simply define tools on your Agent:

[agent.py:11-16](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/google_search_agent/agent.py#L11-L16)

import os
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search
agent = Agent(
name="google_search_agent",
model=os.getenv("DEMO_AGENT_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"),
tools=[google_search],
instruction="You are a helpful assistant that can search the web."
)


When you call `runner.run_live()`

, ADK automatically:

**Detects**when the model returns function calls in streaming responses**Executes**tools in parallel for maximum performance**Handles**before/after tool callbacks for custom logic**Formats**function responses according to Live API requirements**Sends**responses back to the model seamlessly**Yields**both function call and response events to your application

### Tool Execution Events[¶](#tool-execution-events)

When tools execute, you'll receive events through the `run_live()`

async generator:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Function call event - model requesting tool execution
if event.get_function_calls():
print(f"Model calling: {event.get_function_calls()[0].name}")
# Function response event - tool execution result
if event.get_function_responses():
print(f"Tool result: {event.get_function_responses()[0].response}")


You don't need to handle the execution yourself—ADK does it automatically. You just observe the events as they flow through the conversation.

Learn More

The bidi-demo sends all events (including function calls and responses) directly to the WebSocket client without server-side filtering. This allows the client to observe tool execution in real-time through the event stream. See the downstream task in `main.py:219-234`


### Long-Running and Streaming Tools[¶](#long-running-and-streaming-tools)

ADK supports advanced tool patterns that integrate seamlessly with `run_live()`

:

**Long-Running Tools**: Tools that require human approval or take extended time to complete. Mark them with `is_long_running=True`

. In resumable async flows, ADK can pause after long-running calls. In live flows, streaming continues; `long_running_tool_ids`

indicate pending operations and clients can display appropriate UI.

**Streaming Tools**: Tools that accept an `input_stream`

parameter with type `LiveRequestQueue`

can send real-time updates back to the model during execution, enabling progressive responses.

How Streaming Tools Work

When you call `runner.run_live()`

, ADK inspects your agent's tools at initialization (lines 828-865 in `runners.py`

) to identify streaming tools by checking parameter type annotations for `LiveRequestQueue`

.

**Queue creation and lifecycle**:

**Creation**: ADK creates an`ActiveStreamingTool`

with a dedicated`LiveRequestQueue`

for each streaming tool at the start of`run_live()`

(before processing any events)**Storage**: These queues are stored in`invocation_context.active_streaming_tools[tool_name]`

for the duration of the invocation**Injection**: When the model calls the tool, ADK automatically injects the tool's queue as the`input_stream`

parameter (lines 238-253 in`function_tool.py`

)**Usage**: The tool can use this queue to send real-time updates back to the model during execution**Lifecycle**: The queues persist for the entire`run_live()`

invocation (one InvocationContext = one`run_live()`

call) and are destroyed when`run_live()`

exits

**Queue distinction**:

**Main queue**(`live_request_queue`

parameter): Created by your application, used for client-to-model communication**Tool queues**(`active_streaming_tools[tool_name].stream`

): Created automatically by ADK, used for tool-to-model communication during execution

Both types of queues are `LiveRequestQueue`

instances, but they serve different purposes in the streaming architecture.

This enables tools to provide incremental updates, progress notifications, or partial results during long-running operations.

**Code reference**: See `runners.py:828-865`

(tool detection) and `function_tool.py:238-253`

(parameter injection) for implementation details.

See the [Tools Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/) for implementation examples.

### Key Takeaway[¶](#key-takeaway)

The difference between raw Live API tool use and ADK is stark:

| Aspect | Raw Live API | ADK `run_live()` |
|---|---|---|
Tool Declaration |
Manual schema definition | Automatic from Python functions |
Tool Execution |
Manual handling in app code | Automatic parallel execution |
Response Formatting |
Manual JSON construction | Automatic |
Error Handling |
Manual try/catch and formatting | Automatic capture and reporting |
Streaming Integration |
Manual coordination | Automatic event yielding |
Developer Experience |
Complex, error-prone | Declarative, simple |

This automatic handling is one of the core value propositions of ADK—it transforms the complexity of Live API tool use into a simple, declarative developer experience.

## InvocationContext: The Execution State Container[¶](#invocationcontext-the-execution-state-container)

Source Reference

See InvocationContext implementation in `invocation_context.py`


While `run_live()`

returns an AsyncGenerator for consuming events, internally it creates and manages an `InvocationContext`

—ADK's unified state carrier that encapsulates everything needed for a complete conversation invocation. **One InvocationContext corresponds to one run_live() loop**—it's created when you call

`run_live()`

and persists for the entire streaming session.Think of it as a traveling notebook that accompanies a conversation from start to finish, collecting information, tracking progress, and providing context to every component along the way. It's ADK's runtime implementation of the Context concept, providing the execution-time state and services needed during a live conversation. For a broader overview of context in ADK, see [Context in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/).

### What is an Invocation?[¶](#what-is-an-invocation)

An **invocation** represents a complete interaction cycle:
- Starts with user input (text, audio, or control signal)
- May involve one or multiple agent calls
- Ends when a final response is generated or when explicitly terminated
- Is orchestrated by `runner.run_live()`

or `runner.run_async()`


This is distinct from an **agent call** (execution of a single agent's logic) and a **step** (a single LLM call plus any resulting tool executions).

The hierarchy looks like this:

┌─────────────────────── invocation ──────────────────────────┐
┌──────────── llm_agent_call_1 ────────────┐ ┌─ agent_call_2 ─┐
┌──── step_1 ────────┐ ┌───── step_2 ──────┐
[call_llm] [call_tool] [call_llm] [transfer]


### Who Uses InvocationContext?[¶](#who-uses-invocationcontext)

InvocationContext serves different audiences at different levels:

-
**ADK's internal components**(primary users): Runner, Agent, LLMFlow, and GeminiLlmConnection all receive, read from, and write to the InvocationContext as it flows through the stack. This shared context enables seamless coordination without tight coupling. -
**Application developers**(indirect beneficiaries): You don't typically create or manipulate InvocationContext directly in your application code. Instead, you benefit from the clean, simplified APIs that InvocationContext enables behind the scenes—like the elegant`async for event in runner.run_live()`

pattern. -
**Tool and callback developers**(direct access): When you implement custom tools or callbacks, you receive InvocationContext as a parameter. This gives you direct access to conversation state, session services, and control flags (like`end_invocation`

) to implement sophisticated behaviors.

#### What InvocationContext Contains[¶](#what-invocationcontext-contains)

When you implement custom tools or callbacks, you receive InvocationContext as a parameter. Here's what's available to you:

**Essential Fields for Tool/Callback Developers:**

: Current invocation identifier (unique per`context.invocation_id`

`run_live()`

call):`context.session`

: All events in the session history (across all invocations)`context.session.events`

: Persistent key-value store for session data`context.session.state`

: User identity`context.session.user_id`

: Current streaming configuration (response modalities, transcription settings, cost limits)`context.run_config`

: Set this to`context.end_invocation`

`True`

to immediately terminate the conversation (useful for error handling or policy enforcement)

**Example Use Cases in Tool Development:**

# Example: Comprehensive tool implementation showing common InvocationContext patterns
def my_tool(context: InvocationContext, query: str):
# Access user identity
user_id = context.session.user_id
# Check if this is the user's first message
event_count = len(context.session.events)
if event_count == 0:
return "Welcome! This is your first message."
# Access conversation history
recent_events = context.session.events[-5:] # Last 5 events
# Access persistent session state
# Session state persists across invocations (not just this streaming session)
user_preferences = context.session.state.get('user_preferences', {})
# Update session state (will be persisted)
context.session.state['last_query_time'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
# Access services for persistence
if context.artifact_service:
# Store large files/audio
await context.artifact_service.save_artifact(
app_name=context.session.app_name,
user_id=context.session.user_id,
session_id=context.session.id,
filename="result.bin",
artifact=types.Part(inline_data=types.Blob(mime_type="application/octet-stream", data=data)),
)
# Process the query with context
result = process_query(query, context=recent_events, preferences=user_preferences)
# Terminate conversation in specific scenarios
if result.get('error'):
# Processing error - stop conversation
context.end_invocation = True
return result


Understanding InvocationContext is essential for grasping how ADK maintains state, coordinates execution, and enables advanced features like multi-agent workflows and resumability. Even if you never touch it directly, knowing what flows through your application helps you design better agents and debug issues more effectively.

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Workflows[¶](#best-practices-for-multi-agent-workflows)

ADK's bidirectional streaming supports three agent architectures: **single agent** (one agent handles the entire conversation), **multi-agent with sub-agents** (a coordinator agent dynamically routes to specialist agents using `transfer_to_agent`

), and **sequential workflow agents** (agents execute in a fixed pipeline using `task_completed`

). This section focuses on best practices for sequential workflows, where understanding agent transitions and state sharing is crucial for smooth BIDI communication.

For comprehensive coverage of multi-agent patterns, see [Workflow Agents as Orchestrators](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/#workflow-agents-as-orchestrators) in the ADK documentation.

When building multi-agent systems with ADK, understanding how agents transition and share state during live streaming is crucial for smooth BIDI communication.

### SequentialAgent with BIDI Streaming[¶](#sequentialagent-with-bidi-streaming)

`SequentialAgent`

enables workflow pipelines where agents execute one after another. Each agent completes its task before the next one begins. The challenge with live streaming is determining when an agent has finished processing continuous audio or video input.

Source Reference

See SequentialAgent implementation in `sequential_agent.py:119-158`


**How it works:**

ADK automatically adds a `task_completed()`

function to each agent in the sequence. When the model calls this function, it signals completion and triggers the transition to the next agent:

**Usage:**

# SequentialAgent automatically adds this tool to each sub-agent
def task_completed():
"""
Signals that the agent has successfully completed the user's question
or task.
"""
return 'Task completion signaled.'


### Recommended Pattern: Transparent Sequential Flow[¶](#recommended-pattern-transparent-sequential-flow)

The key insight is that **agent transitions happen transparently** within the same `run_live()`

event stream. Your application doesn't need to manage transitions—just consume events uniformly:

**Usage:**

async def handle_sequential_workflow():
"""Recommended pattern for SequentialAgent with BIDI streaming."""
# 1. Single queue shared across all agents in the sequence
queue = LiveRequestQueue()
# 2. Background task captures user input continuously
async def capture_user_input():
while True:
# Your logic to read audio from microphone
audio_chunk = await microphone.read()
queue.send_realtime(
blob=types.Blob(data=audio_chunk, mime_type="audio/pcm")
)
input_task = asyncio.create_task(capture_user_input())
try:
# 3. Single event loop handles ALL agents seamlessly
async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id="user_123",
session_id="session_456",
live_request_queue=queue,
):
# Events flow seamlessly across agent transitions
current_agent = event.author
# Handle audio and text output
if event.content and event.content.parts:
for part in event.content.parts:
# Check for audio data
if part.inline_data and part.inline_data.mime_type.startswith("audio/"):
# Your logic to play audio
await play_audio(part.inline_data.data)
# Check for text data
if part.text:
await display_text(f"[{current_agent}] {part.text}")
# No special transition handling needed!
finally:
input_task.cancel()
queue.close()


### Event Flow During Agent Transitions[¶](#event-flow-during-agent-transitions)

Here's what your application sees when agents transition:

# Agent 1 (Researcher) completes its work
Event: author="researcher", text="I've gathered all the data."
Event: author="researcher", function_call: task_completed()
Event: author="researcher", function_response: task_completed
# --- Automatic transition (invisible to your code) ---
# Agent 2 (Writer) begins
Event: author="writer", text="Let me write the report based on the research..."
Event: author="writer", text=" The findings show..."
Event: author="writer", function_call: task_completed()
Event: author="writer", function_response: task_completed
# --- Automatic transition ---
# Agent 3 (Reviewer) begins - the last agent in sequence
Event: author="reviewer", text="Let me review the report..."
Event: author="reviewer", text="The report looks good. All done!"
Event: author="reviewer", function_call: task_completed()
Event: author="reviewer", function_response: task_completed
# --- Last agent completed: run_live() exits ---
# Your async for loop ends here


### Design Principles[¶](#design-principles)

#### 1. Single Event Loop[¶](#1-single-event-loop)

Use one event loop for all agents in the sequence:

**Usage:**

# ✅ CORRECT: One loop handles all agents
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Your event handling logic here
await handle_event(event) # Works for Agent1, Agent2, Agent3...
# ❌ INCORRECT: Don't break the loop or create multiple loops
for agent in agents:
async for event in runner.run_live(...): # WRONG!
...


#### 2. Persistent Queue[¶](#2-persistent-queue)

The same `LiveRequestQueue`

serves all agents:

# User input flows to whichever agent is currently active
User speaks → Queue → Agent1 (researcher)
↓
User speaks → Queue → Agent2 (writer)
↓
User speaks → Queue → Agent3 (reviewer)


**Don't create new queues per agent:**

# ❌ INCORRECT: New queue per agent
for agent in agents:
new_queue = LiveRequestQueue() # WRONG!
# ✅ CORRECT: Single queue for entire workflow
queue = LiveRequestQueue()
async for event in runner.run_live(live_request_queue=queue):
...


#### 3. Agent-Aware UI (Optional)[¶](#3-agent-aware-ui-optional)

Track which agent is active for better user experience:

**Usage:**

current_agent_name = None
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Detect agent transitions
if event.author and event.author != current_agent_name:
current_agent_name = event.author
# Your logic to update UI indicator
await update_ui_indicator(f"Now: {current_agent_name}")
# Your event handling logic here
await handle_event(event)


#### 4. Transition Notifications[¶](#4-transition-notifications)

Optionally notify users when agents hand off:

**Usage:**

async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# Detect task completion (transition signal)
if event.content and event.content.parts:
for part in event.content.parts:
if (part.function_response and
part.function_response.name == "task_completed"):
# Your logic to display transition notification
await display_notification(
f"✓ {event.author} completed. Handing off to next agent..."
)
continue
# Your event handling logic here
await handle_event(event)


### Key Differences: transfer_to_agent vs task_completed[¶](#key-differences-transfer_to_agent-vs-task_completed)

Understanding these two functions helps you choose the right multi-agent pattern:

| Function | Agent Pattern | When `run_live()` Exits |
Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
`transfer_to_agent` |
Coordinator (dynamic routing) | `LiveRequestQueue.close()` |
Route user to specialist based on intent |
`task_completed` |
Sequential (pipeline) | `LiveRequestQueue.close()` or `task_completed` of the last agent |
Fixed workflow: research → write → review |

**transfer_to_agent example:**

# Coordinator routes based on user intent
User: "I need help with billing"
Event: author="coordinator", function_call: transfer_to_agent(agent_name="billing")
# Stream continues with billing agent - same run_live() loop
Event: author="billing", text="I can help with your billing question..."


**task_completed example:**

# Sequential workflow progresses through pipeline
Event: author="researcher", function_call: task_completed()
# Current agent exits, next agent in sequence begins
Event: author="writer", text="Based on the research..."


### Best Practices Summary[¶](#best-practices-summary)

| Practice | Reason |
|---|---|
| Use single event loop | ADK handles transitions internally |
| Keep queue alive across agents | Same queue serves all sequential agents |
Track `event.author` |
Know which agent is currently responding |
| Don't reset session/context | Conversation state persists across agents |
| Handle events uniformly | All agents produce the same event types |
Let `task_completed` signal transitions |
Don't manually manage sequential flow |

The SequentialAgent design ensures smooth transitions—your application simply sees a continuous stream of events from different agents in sequence, with automatic handoffs managed by ADK.

## Summary[¶](#summary)

In this part, you mastered event handling in ADK's Bidi-streaming architecture. We explored the different event types that agents generate—text responses, audio chunks, transcriptions, tool calls, and control signals—and learned how to process each event type effectively. You now understand how to handle interruptions and turn completion signals for natural conversation flow, serialize events for network transport using Pydantic's model serialization, leverage ADK's automatic tool execution to simplify agent workflows, and access InvocationContext for advanced state management scenarios. With these event handling patterns in place, you're equipped to build responsive streaming applications that provide real-time feedback to users. Next, you'll learn how to configure sophisticated streaming behaviors through RunConfig, including multimodal interactions, session resumption, and cost controls.

# Part 5: How to Use Audio, Image and Video¶

# Part 5: How to Use Audio, Image and Video[¶](#part-5-how-to-use-audio-image-and-video)

This section covers audio, image and video capabilities in ADK's Live API integration, including supported models, audio model architectures, specifications, and best practices for implementing voice and video features.

## How to Use Audio[¶](#how-to-use-audio)

Live API's audio capabilities enable natural voice conversations with sub-second latency through bidirectional audio streaming. This section covers how to send audio input to the model and receive audio responses, including format requirements, streaming best practices, and client-side implementation patterns.

### Sending Audio Input[¶](#sending-audio-input)

**Audio Format Requirements:**

Before calling `send_realtime()`

, ensure your audio data is already in the correct format:

**Format**: 16-bit PCM (signed integer)**Sample Rate**: 16,000 Hz (16kHz)**Channels**: Mono (single channel)

ADK does not perform audio format conversion. Sending audio in incorrect formats will result in poor quality or errors.

[main.py:181-184](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L181-L184)

audio_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data=audio_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)


#### Best Practices for Sending Audio Input[¶](#best-practices-for-sending-audio-input)

-
**Chunked Streaming**: Send audio in small chunks for low latency. Choose chunk size based on your latency requirements:**Ultra-low latency**(real-time conversation): 10-20ms chunks (~320-640 bytes @ 16kHz)**Balanced**(recommended): 50-100ms chunks (~1600-3200 bytes @ 16kHz)**Lower overhead**: 100-200ms chunks (~3200-6400 bytes @ 16kHz)

Use consistent chunk sizes throughout the session for optimal performance. Example: 100ms @ 16kHz = 16000 samples/sec × 0.1 sec × 2 bytes/sample = 3200 bytes.

-
**Prompt Forwarding**: ADK's`LiveRequestQueue`

forwards each chunk promptly without coalescing or batching. Choose chunk sizes that meet your latency and bandwidth requirements. Don't wait for model responses before sending next chunks. -
**Continuous Processing**: The model processes audio continuously, not turn-by-turn. With automatic VAD enabled (the default), just stream continuously and let the API detect speech. -
**Activity Signals**: Use`send_activity_start()`

/`send_activity_end()`

only when you explicitly disable VAD for manual turn-taking control. VAD is enabled by default, so activity signals are not needed for most applications.

#### Handling Audio Input at the Client[¶](#handling-audio-input-at-the-client)

In browser-based applications, capturing microphone audio and sending it to the server requires using the Web Audio API with AudioWorklet processors. The bidi-demo demonstrates how to capture microphone input, convert it to the required 16-bit PCM format at 16kHz, and stream it continuously to the WebSocket server.

**Architecture:**

**Audio capture**: Use Web Audio API to access microphone with 16kHz sample rate**Audio processing**: AudioWorklet processor captures audio frames in real-time**Format conversion**: Convert Float32Array samples to 16-bit PCM**WebSocket streaming**: Send PCM chunks to server via WebSocket

[audio-recorder.js:7-58](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/audio-recorder.js#L7-L58)

// Start audio recorder worklet
export async function startAudioRecorderWorklet(audioRecorderHandler) {
// Create an AudioContext with 16kHz sample rate
// This matches the Live API's required input format (16-bit PCM @ 16kHz)
const audioRecorderContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 16000 });
// Load the AudioWorklet module that will process audio in real-time
// AudioWorklet runs on a separate thread for low-latency, glitch-free audio processing
const workletURL = new URL("./pcm-recorder-processor.js", import.meta.url);
await audioRecorderContext.audioWorklet.addModule(workletURL);
// Request access to the user's microphone
// channelCount: 1 requests mono audio (single channel) as required by Live API
micStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
audio: { channelCount: 1 }
});
const source = audioRecorderContext.createMediaStreamSource(micStream);
// Create an AudioWorkletNode that uses our custom PCM recorder processor
// This node will capture audio frames and send them to our handler
const audioRecorderNode = new AudioWorkletNode(
audioRecorderContext,
"pcm-recorder-processor"
);
// Connect the microphone source to the worklet processor
// The processor will receive audio frames and post them via port.postMessage
source.connect(audioRecorderNode);
audioRecorderNode.port.onmessage = (event) => {
// Convert Float32Array to 16-bit PCM format required by Live API
const pcmData = convertFloat32ToPCM(event.data);
// Send the PCM data to the handler (which will forward to WebSocket)
audioRecorderHandler(pcmData);
};
return [audioRecorderNode, audioRecorderContext, micStream];
}
// Convert Float32 samples to 16-bit PCM
function convertFloat32ToPCM(inputData) {
// Create an Int16Array of the same length
const pcm16 = new Int16Array(inputData.length);
for (let i = 0; i < inputData.length; i++) {
// Web Audio API provides Float32 samples in range [-1.0, 1.0]
// Multiply by 0x7fff (32767) to convert to 16-bit signed integer range [-32768, 32767]
pcm16[i] = inputData[i] * 0x7fff;
}
// Return the underlying ArrayBuffer (binary data) for efficient transmission
return pcm16.buffer;
}


[pcm-recorder-processor.js:1-18](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/pcm-recorder-processor.js#L1-L18)

super();
}
process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
if (inputs.length > 0 && inputs[0].length > 0) {
// Use the first channel (mono)
const inputChannel = inputs[0][0];
// Copy the buffer to avoid issues with recycled memory
const inputCopy = new Float32Array(inputChannel);
this.port.postMessage(inputCopy);
}
return true;
}
}
registerProcessor("pcm-recorder-processor", PCMProcessor);


[app.js:977-986](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L979-L988)

// Audio recorder handler - called for each audio chunk
function audioRecorderHandler(pcmData) {
if (websocket && websocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN && is_audio) {
// Send audio as binary WebSocket frame (more efficient than base64 JSON)
websocket.send(pcmData);
console.log("[CLIENT TO AGENT] Sent audio chunk: %s bytes", pcmData.byteLength);
}
}


**Key Implementation Details:**

-
**16kHz Sample Rate**: The AudioContext must be created with`sampleRate: 16000`

to match Live API requirements. Modern browsers support this rate. -
**Mono Audio**: Request single-channel audio (`channelCount: 1`

) since Live API expects mono input. This reduces bandwidth and processing overhead. -
**AudioWorklet Processing**: AudioWorklet runs on a separate thread from the main JavaScript thread, ensuring low-latency, glitch-free audio processing without blocking the UI. -
**Float32 to PCM16 Conversion**: Web Audio API provides audio as Float32Array values in range [-1.0, 1.0]. Multiply by 32767 (0x7fff) to convert to 16-bit signed integer PCM. -
**Binary WebSocket Frames**: Send PCM data directly as ArrayBuffer via WebSocket binary frames instead of base64-encoding in JSON. This reduces bandwidth by ~33% and eliminates encoding/decoding overhead. -
**Continuous Streaming**: The AudioWorklet`process()`

method is called automatically at regular intervals (typically 128 samples at a time for 16kHz). This provides consistent chunk sizes for streaming.

This architecture ensures low-latency audio capture and efficient transmission to the server, which then forwards it to the ADK Live API via `LiveRequestQueue.send_realtime()`

.

### Receiving Audio Output[¶](#receiving-audio-output)

When `response_modalities=["AUDIO"]`

is configured, the model returns audio data in the event stream as `inline_data`

parts.

**Audio Format Requirements:**

The model outputs audio in the following format:

**Format**: 16-bit PCM (signed integer)**Sample Rate**: 24,000 Hz (24kHz) for native audio models**Channels**: Mono (single channel)**MIME Type**:`audio/pcm;rate=24000`


The audio data arrives as raw PCM bytes, ready for playback or further processing. No additional conversion is required unless you need a different sample rate or format.

**Receiving Audio Output:**

from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode
# Configure for audio output
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"], # Required for audio responses
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI
)
# Process audio output from the model
async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id="user_123",
session_id="session_456",
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
# Events may contain multiple parts (text, audio, etc.)
if event.content and event.content.parts:
for part in event.content.parts:
# Audio data arrives as inline_data with audio/pcm MIME type
if part.inline_data and part.inline_data.mime_type.startswith("audio/pcm"):
# The data is already decoded to raw bytes (24kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono)
audio_bytes = part.inline_data.data
# Your logic to stream audio to client
await stream_audio_to_client(audio_bytes)
# Or save to file
# with open("output.pcm", "ab") as f:
# f.write(audio_bytes)


Automatic Base64 Decoding

The Live API wire protocol transmits audio data as base64-encoded strings. The google.genai types system uses Pydantic's base64 serialization feature (`val_json_bytes='base64'`

) to automatically decode base64 strings into bytes when deserializing API responses. When you access `part.inline_data.data`

, you receive ready-to-use bytes—no manual base64 decoding needed.

#### Handling Audio Events at the Client[¶](#handling-audio-events-at-the-client)

The bidi-demo uses a different architectural approach: instead of processing audio on the server, it forwards all events (including audio data) to the WebSocket client and handles audio playback in the browser. This pattern separates concerns—the server focuses on ADK event streaming while the client handles media playback using Web Audio API.

[main.py:225-233](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L225-L233)

# The bidi-demo forwards all events (including audio) to the WebSocket client
async for event in runner.run_live(
user_id=user_id,
session_id=session_id,
live_request_queue=live_request_queue,
run_config=run_config
):
event_json = event.model_dump_json(exclude_none=True, by_alias=True)
await websocket.send_text(event_json)


**Demo Implementation (Client - JavaScript):**

The client-side implementation involves three components: WebSocket message handling, audio player setup with AudioWorklet, and the AudioWorklet processor itself.

[app.js:638-688](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L640-L690)

}
}
}
}
// Decode base64 audio data to ArrayBuffer
function base64ToArray(base64) {
// Convert base64url to standard base64 (RFC 4648 compliance)
// base64url uses '-' and '_' instead of '+' and '/', which are URL-safe
let standardBase64 = base64.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
// Add padding '=' characters if needed
// Base64 strings must be multiples of 4 characters
while (standardBase64.length % 4) {
standardBase64 += '=';
}
// Decode base64 string to binary string using browser API
const binaryString = window.atob(standardBase64);
const len = binaryString.length;
const bytes = new Uint8Array(len);
// Convert each character code (0-255) to a byte

// Move read index forward unless buffer is empty (underflow protection)
if (this.readIndex != this.writeIndex) {
this.readIndex = (this.readIndex + 1) % this.bufferSize;
}
// If readIndex == writeIndex, we're out of data - output silence (0.0)
}
return true; // Keep processor alive (return false to terminate)
}
}
registerProcessor('pcm-player-processor', PCMPlayerProcessor);


**Key Implementation Patterns:**

-
**Base64 Decoding**: The server sends audio data as base64-encoded strings in JSON. The client must decode to ArrayBuffer before passing to AudioWorklet. Handle both standard base64 and base64url encoding. -
**24kHz Sample Rate**: The AudioContext must be created with`sampleRate: 24000`

to match Live API output format (different from 16kHz input). -
**Ring Buffer Architecture**: Use a circular buffer to handle variable network latency and ensure smooth playback. The buffer stores Float32 samples and handles overflow by overwriting oldest data. -
**PCM16 to Float32 Conversion**: Live API sends 16-bit signed integers. Divide by 32768 to convert to Float32 in range [-1.0, 1.0] required by Web Audio API. -
**Mono to Stereo**: The processor duplicates mono audio to both left and right channels for stereo output, ensuring compatibility with all audio devices. -
**Interruption Handling**: On interruption events, send`endOfAudio`

command to clear the buffer by setting`readIndex = writeIndex`

, preventing playback of stale audio.

This architecture ensures smooth, low-latency audio playback while handling network jitter and interruptions gracefully.

## How to Use Image and Video[¶](#how-to-use-image-and-video)

Both images and video in ADK Bidi-streaming are processed as JPEG frames. Rather than typical video streaming using HLS, mp4, or H.264, ADK uses a straightforward frame-by-frame image processing approach where both static images and video frames are sent as individual JPEG images.

**Image/Video Specifications:**

**Format**: JPEG (`image/jpeg`

)**Frame rate**: 1 frame per second (1 FPS) recommended maximum**Resolution**: 768x768 pixels (recommended)

[main.py:202-217](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/31847c0723fbf16ddf6eed411eb070d1c76afd1a/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/main.py#L202-L217)

# Decode base64 image data
image_data = base64.b64decode(json_message["data"])
mime_type = json_message.get("mimeType", "image/jpeg")
# Send image as blob
image_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type=mime_type,
data=image_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(image_blob)


**Not Suitable For**:

**Real-time video action recognition**- 1 FPS is too slow to capture rapid movements or actions**Live sports analysis or motion tracking**- Insufficient temporal resolution for fast-moving subjects

**Example Use Case for Image Processing**:

In the [Shopper's Concierge demo](https://youtu.be/LwHPYyw7u6U?si=lG9gl9aSIuu-F4ME&t=40), the application uses `send_realtime()`

to send the user-uploaded image. The agent recognizes the context from the image and searches for relevant items on the e-commerce site.

### Handling Image Input at the Client[¶](#handling-image-input-at-the-client)

In browser-based applications, capturing images from the user's webcam and sending them to the server requires using the MediaDevices API to access the camera, capturing frames to a canvas, and converting to JPEG format. The bidi-demo demonstrates how to open a camera preview modal, capture a single frame, and send it as base64-encoded JPEG to the WebSocket server.

**Architecture:**

**Camera access**: Use`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`

to access webcam**Video preview**: Display live camera feed in a`<video>`

element**Frame capture**: Draw video frame to`<canvas>`

and convert to JPEG**Base64 encoding**: Convert canvas to base64 data URL for transmission**WebSocket transmission**: Send as JSON message to server

[app.js:801-843](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L803-L845)

// 1. Opening Camera Preview
// Open camera modal and start preview
async function openCameraPreview() {
try {
// Request access to the user's webcam with 768x768 resolution
cameraStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
video: {
width: { ideal: 768 },
height: { ideal: 768 },
facingMode: 'user'
}
});
// Set the stream to the video element
cameraPreview.srcObject = cameraStream;
// Show the modal
cameraModal.classList.add('show');
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error accessing camera:', error);
addSystemMessage(`Failed to access camera: ${error.message}`);
}
}
// Close camera modal and stop preview
function closeCameraPreview() {
// Stop the camera stream
if (cameraStream) {
cameraStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
cameraStream = null;
}
// Clear the video source
cameraPreview.srcObject = null;
// Hide the modal
cameraModal.classList.remove('show');
}


[app.js:846-914](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L848-L916)

// 2. Capturing and Sending Image
// Capture image from the live preview
function captureImageFromPreview() {
if (!cameraStream) {
addSystemMessage('No camera stream available');
return;
}
try {
// Create canvas to capture the frame
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
canvas.width = cameraPreview.videoWidth;
canvas.height = cameraPreview.videoHeight;
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
// Draw current video frame to canvas
context.drawImage(cameraPreview, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
// Convert canvas to data URL for display
const imageDataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.85);
// Display the captured image in the chat
const imageBubble = createImageBubble(imageDataUrl, true);
messagesDiv.appendChild(imageBubble);
// Convert canvas to blob for sending to server
canvas.toBlob((blob) => {
// Convert blob to base64 for sending to server
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.onloadend = () => {
// Remove data:image/jpeg;base64, prefix
const base64data = reader.result.split(',')[1];
sendImage(base64data);
};
reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
}, 'image/jpeg', 0.85);
// Close the camera modal
closeCameraPreview();
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error capturing image:', error);
addSystemMessage(`Failed to capture image: ${error.message}`);
}
}
// Send image to server
function sendImage(base64Image) {
if (websocket && websocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
const jsonMessage = JSON.stringify({
type: "image",
data: base64Image,
mimeType: "image/jpeg"
});
websocket.send(jsonMessage);
console.log("[CLIENT TO AGENT] Sent image");
}
}


**Key Implementation Details:**

-
**768x768 Resolution**: Request ideal resolution of 768x768 to match the recommended specification. The browser will provide the closest available resolution. -
**User-Facing Camera**: The`facingMode: 'user'`

constraint selects the front-facing camera on mobile devices, appropriate for self-portrait captures. -
**Canvas Frame Capture**: Use`canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage()`

to capture a single frame from the live video stream. This creates a static snapshot of the current video frame. -
**JPEG Compression**: The second parameter to`toDataURL()`

and`toBlob()`

is the quality (0.0 to 1.0). Using 0.85 provides good quality while keeping file size manageable. -
**Dual Output**: The code creates both a data URL for immediate UI display and a blob for efficient base64 encoding, demonstrating a pattern for responsive user feedback. -
**Resource Cleanup**: Always call`getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop())`

when closing the camera to release the hardware resource and turn off the camera indicator light. -
**Base64 Encoding**: The FileReader converts the blob to a data URL (`data:image/jpeg;base64,<data>`

). Split on comma and take the second part to get just the base64 data without the prefix.

This implementation provides a user-friendly camera interface with preview, single-frame capture, and efficient transmission to the server for processing by the Live API.

### Custom Video Streaming Tools Support[¶](#custom-video-streaming-tools-support)

ADK provides special tool support for processing video frames during streaming sessions. Unlike regular tools that execute synchronously, streaming tools can yield video frames asynchronously while the model continues to generate responses.

**Streaming Tool Lifecycle:**

**Start**: ADK invokes your async generator function when the model calls it**Stream**: Your function yields results continuously via`AsyncGenerator`

**Stop**: ADK cancels the generator task when:- The model calls a
`stop_streaming()`

function you provide - The session ends
- An error occurs

**Important**: You must provide a `stop_streaming(function_name: str)`

function as a tool to allow the model to explicitly stop streaming operations.

For implementing custom video streaming tools that process and yield video frames to the model, see the [Streaming Tools documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/streaming-tools/).

## Understanding Audio Model Architectures[¶](#understanding-audio-model-architectures)

When building voice applications with the Live API, one of the most important decisions is selecting the right audio model architecture. The Live API supports two fundamentally different type of models for audio processing: **Native Audio** and **Half-Cascade**. These model architectures differ in how they process audio input and generate audio output, which directly impacts response naturalness, tool execution reliability, latency characteristics, and overall use case suitability.

Understanding these architectures helps you make informed model selection decisions based on your application's requirements—whether you prioritize natural conversational AI, production reliability, or specific feature availability.

### Native Audio Models[¶](#native-audio-models)

A fully integrated end-to-end audio model architecture where the model processes audio input and generates audio output directly, without intermediate text conversion. This approach enables more human-like speech with natural prosody.

| Audio Model Architecture | Platform | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native Audio | Gemini Live API |
|

[gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash-live-api)**Key Characteristics:**

**End-to-end audio processing**: Processes audio input and generates audio output directly without converting to text intermediately**Natural prosody**: Produces more human-like speech patterns, intonation, and emotional expressiveness**Extended voice library**: Supports all half-cascade voices plus additional voices from Text-to-Speech (TTS) service**Automatic language detection**: Determines language from conversation context without explicit configuration**Advanced conversational features**:: Adapts response style to input expression and tone, detecting emotional cues[Affective dialog](#proactivity-and-affective-dialog): Can proactively decide when to respond, offer suggestions, or ignore irrelevant input[Proactive audio](#proactivity-and-affective-dialog)**Dynamic thinking**: Supports thought summaries and dynamic thinking budgets**AUDIO-only response modality**: Does not support TEXT response modality with`RunConfig`

, resulting in slower initial response times

### Half-Cascade Models[¶](#half-cascade-models)

A hybrid architecture that combines native audio input processing with text-to-speech (TTS) output generation. Also referred to as "Cascaded" models in some documentation.

Audio input is processed natively, but responses are first generated as text then converted to speech. This separation provides better reliability and more robust tool execution in production environments.

| Audio Model Architecture | Platform | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Half-Cascade | Gemini Live API |
|

[gemini-live-2.5-flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash#2.5-flash)**Key Characteristics:**

**Hybrid architecture**: Combines native audio input processing with TTS-based audio output generation**TEXT response modality support**: Supports TEXT response modality with`RunConfig`

in addition to AUDIO, enabling much faster responses for text-only use cases**Explicit language control**: Supports manual language code configuration via`speech_config.language_code`

**Established TTS quality**: Leverages proven text-to-speech technology for consistent audio output**Supported voices**: Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, Aoede, Leda, Orus, Zephyr (8 prebuilt voices)

### How to Handle Model Names[¶](#how-to-handle-model-names)

When building ADK applications, you'll need to specify which model to use. The recommended approach is to use environment variables for model configuration, which provides flexibility as model availability and naming change over time.

**Recommended Pattern:**

import os
from google.adk.agents import Agent
# Use environment variable with fallback to a sensible default
agent = Agent(
name="my_agent",
model=os.getenv("DEMO_AGENT_MODEL", "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"),
tools=[...],
instruction="..."
)


**Why use environment variables:**

**Model availability changes**: Models are released, updated, and deprecated regularly (e.g.,`gemini-2.0-flash-live-001`

was deprecated on December 09, 2025)**Platform-specific names**: Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API use different model naming conventions for the same functionality**Easy switching**: Change models without modifying code by updating the`.env`

file**Environment-specific configuration**: Use different models for development, staging, and production

**Configuration in .env file:**

# For Gemini Live API (publicly available)
DEMO_AGENT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025
# For Vertex AI Live API (if using Vertex AI)
# DEMO_AGENT_MODEL=gemini-live-2.5-flash-native-audio


Environment Variable Loading Order

When using `.env`

files with `python-dotenv`

, you must call `load_dotenv()`

**before** importing any modules that read environment variables. Otherwise, `os.getenv()`

will return `None`

and fall back to the default value, ignoring your `.env`

configuration.

**Correct order in main.py:**

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path
# Load .env file BEFORE importing agent
load_dotenv(Path(__file__).parent / ".env")
# Now safe to import modules that use environment variables
from google_search_agent.agent import agent


**Incorrect order (will not work):**

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from google_search_agent.agent import agent # Agent reads env var here
# Too late! Agent already initialized with default model
load_dotenv(Path(__file__).parent / ".env")


This is a Python import behavior: when you import a module, its top-level code executes immediately. If your agent module calls `os.getenv("DEMO_AGENT_MODEL")`

at import time, the `.env`

file must already be loaded.

**Selecting the right model:**

**Choose platform**: Decide between Gemini Live API (public) or Vertex AI Live API (enterprise)**Choose architecture**:- Native Audio for natural conversational AI with advanced features
- Half-Cascade for production reliability with tool execution
**Check current availability**: Refer to the model tables above and official documentation**Configure environment variable**: Set`DEMO_AGENT_MODEL`

in your`.env`

file (seeand`agent.py:11-16`

)`main.py:99-152`


### Live API Models Compatibility and Availability[¶](#live-api-models-compatibility-and-availability)

For the latest information on Live API model compatibility and availability:

**Gemini Live API models**: See the[Gemini models documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini)**Vertex AI Live API models**: See the[Vertex AI model documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models)

Always verify model availability and feature support in the official documentation before deploying to production.

## Audio Transcription[¶](#audio-transcription)

The Live API provides built-in audio transcription capabilities that automatically convert speech to text for both user input and model output. This eliminates the need for external transcription services and enables real-time captions, conversation logging, and accessibility features. ADK exposes these capabilities through `RunConfig`

, allowing you to enable transcription for either or both audio directions.

**Configuration:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
# Default behavior: Audio transcription is ENABLED by default
# Both input and output transcription are automatically configured
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"]
# input_audio_transcription defaults to AudioTranscriptionConfig()
# output_audio_transcription defaults to AudioTranscriptionConfig()
)
# To disable transcription explicitly:
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
input_audio_transcription=None, # Explicitly disable user input transcription
output_audio_transcription=None # Explicitly disable model output transcription
)
# Enable only input transcription (disable output):
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
input_audio_transcription=types.AudioTranscriptionConfig(), # Explicitly enable (redundant with default)
output_audio_transcription=None # Explicitly disable
)
# Enable only output transcription (disable input):
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
input_audio_transcription=None, # Explicitly disable
output_audio_transcription=types.AudioTranscriptionConfig() # Explicitly enable (redundant with default)
)


**Event Structure**:

Transcriptions are delivered as `types.Transcription`

objects on the `Event`

object:

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional
from google.genai import types
@dataclass
class Event:
content: Optional[Content] # Audio/text content
input_transcription: Optional[types.Transcription] # User speech → text
output_transcription: Optional[types.Transcription] # Model speech → text
# ... other fields


Learn More

For complete Event structure, see [Part 3: The Event Class](../part3/#the-event-class).

Each `Transcription`

object has two attributes:
- ** .text**: The transcribed text (string)
-

**: Boolean indicating if transcription is complete (True) or partial (False)**

`.finished`

**How Transcriptions Are Delivered**:

Transcriptions arrive as separate fields in the event stream, not as content parts. Always use defensive null checking when accessing transcription data:

**Processing Transcriptions:**

from google.adk.runners import Runner
# ... runner setup code ...
async for event in runner.run_live(...):
# User's speech transcription (from input audio)
if event.input_transcription: # First check: transcription object exists
# Access the transcription text and status
user_text = event.input_transcription.text
is_finished = event.input_transcription.finished
# Second check: text is not None or empty
# This handles cases where transcription is in progress or empty
if user_text and user_text.strip():
print(f"User said: {user_text} (finished: {is_finished})")
# Your caption update logic
update_caption(user_text, is_user=True, is_final=is_finished)
# Model's speech transcription (from output audio)
if event.output_transcription: # First check: transcription object exists
model_text = event.output_transcription.text
is_finished = event.output_transcription.finished
# Second check: text is not None or empty
# This handles cases where transcription is in progress or empty
if model_text and model_text.strip():
print(f"Model said: {model_text} (finished: {is_finished})")
# Your caption update logic
update_caption(model_text, is_user=False, is_final=is_finished)


Best Practice for Transcription Null Checking

Always use two-level null checking for transcriptions:

- Check if the transcription object exists (
`if event.input_transcription`

) - Check if the text is not empty (
`if user_text and user_text.strip()`

)

This pattern prevents errors from `None`

values and handles partial transcriptions that may be empty.

### Handling Audio Transcription at the Client[¶](#handling-audio-transcription-at-the-client)

In web applications, transcription events need to be forwarded from the server to the browser and rendered in the UI. The bidi-demo demonstrates a pattern where the server forwards all ADK events (including transcription events) to the WebSocket client, and the client handles displaying transcriptions as speech bubbles with visual indicators for partial vs. finished transcriptions.

**Architecture:**

**Server side**: Forward transcription events through WebSocket (already shown in previous section)**Client side**: Process`inputTranscription`

and`outputTranscription`

events from the WebSocket**UI rendering**: Display partial transcriptions with typing indicators, finalize when`finished: true`


[app.js:530-653](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/2f7b82f182659e0990bfb86f6ef400dd82633c07/python/agents/bidi-demo/app/static/js/app.js#L532-L655)

// Handle input transcription (user's spoken words)
if (adkEvent.inputTranscription && adkEvent.inputTranscription.text) {
const transcriptionText = adkEvent.inputTranscription.text;
const isFinished = adkEvent.inputTranscription.finished;
if (transcriptionText) {
if (currentInputTranscriptionId == null) {
// Create new transcription bubble
currentInputTranscriptionId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
currentInputTranscriptionElement = createMessageBubble(
transcriptionText,
true, // isUser
!isFinished // isPartial
);
currentInputTranscriptionElement.id = currentInputTranscriptionId;
currentInputTranscriptionElement.classList.add("transcription");
messagesDiv.appendChild(currentInputTranscriptionElement);
} else {
// Update existing transcription bubble
if (currentOutputTranscriptionId == null && currentMessageId == null) {
// Accumulate input transcription text (Live API sends incremental pieces)
const existingText = currentInputTranscriptionElement
.querySelector(".bubble-text").textContent;
const cleanText = existingText.replace(/\.\.\.$/, '');
const accumulatedText = cleanText + transcriptionText;
updateMessageBubble(
currentInputTranscriptionElement,
accumulatedText,
!isFinished
);
}
}
// If transcription is finished, reset the state
if (isFinished) {
currentInputTranscriptionId = null;
currentInputTranscriptionElement = null;
}
}
}
// Handle output transcription (model's spoken words)
if (adkEvent.outputTranscription && adkEvent.outputTranscription.text) {
const transcriptionText = adkEvent.outputTranscription.text;
const isFinished = adkEvent.outputTranscription.finished;
if (transcriptionText) {
// Finalize any active input transcription when model starts responding
if (currentInputTranscriptionId != null && currentOutputTranscriptionId == null) {
const textElement = currentInputTranscriptionElement
.querySelector(".bubble-text");
const typingIndicator = textElement.querySelector(".typing-indicator");
if (typingIndicator) {
typingIndicator.remove();
}
currentInputTranscriptionId = null;
currentInputTranscriptionElement = null;
}
if (currentOutputTranscriptionId == null) {
// Create new transcription bubble for model
currentOutputTranscriptionId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7);
currentOutputTranscriptionElement = createMessageBubble(
transcriptionText,
false, // isUser
!isFinished // isPartial
);
currentOutputTranscriptionElement.id = currentOutputTranscriptionId;
currentOutputTranscriptionElement.classList.add("transcription");
messagesDiv.appendChild(currentOutputTranscriptionElement);
} else {
// Update existing transcription bubble
const existingText = currentOutputTranscriptionElement
.querySelector(".bubble-text").textContent;
const cleanText = existingText.replace(/\.\.\.$/, '');
updateMessageBubble(
currentOutputTranscriptionElement,
cleanText + transcriptionText,
!isFinished
);
}
// If transcription is finished, reset the state
if (isFinished) {
currentOutputTranscriptionId = null;
currentOutputTranscriptionElement = null;
}
}
}


**Key Implementation Patterns:**

-
**Incremental Text Accumulation**: The Live API may send transcriptions in multiple chunks. Accumulate text by appending new pieces to existing content: -
**Partial vs Finished States**: Use the`finished`

flag to determine whether to show typing indicators: `finished: false`

→ Show typing indicator (e.g., "...")-
`finished: true`

→ Remove typing indicator, finalize bubble -
**Bubble State Management**: Track current transcription bubbles separately for input and output using IDs. Create new bubbles only when starting fresh transcriptions: -
**Turn Coordination**: When the model starts responding (first output transcription arrives), finalize any active input transcription to prevent overlapping updates.

This pattern ensures smooth real-time transcription display with proper handling of streaming updates, turn transitions, and visual feedback for users.

### Multi-Agent Transcription Requirements[¶](#multi-agent-transcription-requirements)

For multi-agent scenarios (agents with `sub_agents`

), ADK automatically enables audio transcription regardless of your `RunConfig`

settings. This automatic behavior is required for agent transfer functionality, where text transcriptions are used to pass conversation context between agents.

**Automatic Enablement Behavior:**

When an agent has `sub_agents`

defined, ADK's `run_live()`

method automatically enables both input and output audio transcription **even if you explicitly set them to None**. This ensures that agent transfers work correctly by providing text context to the next agent.

**Why This Matters:**

**Cannot be disabled**: You cannot turn off transcription in multi-agent scenarios**Required for functionality**: Agent transfer breaks without text context**Transparent to developers**: Transcription events are automatically available**Plan for data handling**: Your application will receive transcription events that must be processed

**Implementation Details:**

The automatic enablement happens in `Runner.run_live()`

when both conditions are met:
- The agent has `sub_agents`

defined
- A `LiveRequestQueue`

is provided (bidirectional streaming mode)

Source

## Voice Configuration (Speech Config)[¶](#voice-configuration-speech-config)

The Live API provides voice configuration capabilities that allow you to customize how the model sounds when generating audio responses. ADK supports voice configuration at two levels: **agent-level** (per-agent voice settings) and **session-level** (global voice settings via RunConfig). This enables sophisticated multi-agent scenarios where different agents can speak with different voices, as well as single-agent applications with consistent voice characteristics.

### Agent-Level Configuration[¶](#agent-level-configuration)

You can configure `speech_config`

on a per-agent basis by creating a custom `Gemini`

LLM instance with voice settings, then passing that instance to the `Agent`

. This is particularly useful in multi-agent workflows where different agents represent different personas or roles.

**Configuration:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.tools import google_search
# Create a Gemini instance with custom speech config
custom_llm = Gemini(
model="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025",
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Puck"
)
),
language_code="en-US"
)
)
# Pass the Gemini instance to the agent
agent = Agent(
model=custom_llm,
tools=[google_search],
instruction="You are a helpful assistant."
)


### RunConfig-Level Configuration[¶](#runconfig-level-configuration)

You can also set `speech_config`

in RunConfig to apply a default voice configuration for all agents in the session. This is useful for single-agent applications or when you want a consistent voice across all agents.

**Configuration:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Kore"
)
),
language_code="en-US"
)
)


### Configuration Precedence[¶](#configuration-precedence)

When both agent-level (via `Gemini`

instance) and session-level (via `RunConfig`

) `speech_config`

are provided, **agent-level configuration takes precedence**. This allows you to set a default voice in RunConfig while overriding it for specific agents.

**Precedence Rules:**

**Gemini instance has**: Use the Gemini's voice configuration (highest priority)`speech_config`

**RunConfig has**: Use RunConfig's voice configuration`speech_config`

**Neither specified**: Use Live API default voice (lowest priority)

**Example:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
from google.adk.tools import google_search
# Create Gemini instance with custom voice
custom_llm = Gemini(
model="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025",
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Puck" # Agent-level: highest priority
)
)
)
)
# Agent uses the Gemini instance with custom voice
agent = Agent(
model=custom_llm,
tools=[google_search],
instruction="You are a helpful assistant."
)
# RunConfig with default voice (will be overridden by agent's Gemini config)
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Kore" # This is overridden for the agent above
)
)
)
)


### Multi-Agent Voice Configuration[¶](#multi-agent-voice-configuration)

For multi-agent workflows, you can assign different voices to different agents by creating separate `Gemini`

instances with distinct `speech_config`

values. This creates more natural and distinguishable conversations where each agent has its own voice personality.

**Multi-Agent Example:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
# Customer service agent with a friendly voice
customer_service_llm = Gemini(
model="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025",
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Aoede" # Friendly, warm voice
)
)
)
)
customer_service_agent = Agent(
name="customer_service",
model=customer_service_llm,
instruction="You are a friendly customer service representative."
)
# Technical support agent with a professional voice
technical_support_llm = Gemini(
model="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025",
speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(
voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
voice_name="Charon" # Professional, authoritative voice
)
)
)
)
technical_support_agent = Agent(
name="technical_support",
model=technical_support_llm,
instruction="You are a technical support specialist."
)
# Root agent that coordinates the workflow
root_agent = Agent(
name="root_agent",
model="gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025",
instruction="Coordinate customer service and technical support.",
sub_agents=[customer_service_agent, technical_support_agent]
)
# RunConfig without speech_config - each agent uses its own voice
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"]
)


In this example, when the customer service agent speaks, users hear the "Aoede" voice. When the technical support agent takes over, users hear the "Charon" voice. This creates a more engaging and natural multi-agent experience.

### Configuration Parameters[¶](#configuration-parameters)

** voice_config**: Specifies which prebuilt voice to use for audio generation
- Configured through nested

`VoiceConfig`

and `PrebuiltVoiceConfig`

objects
- `voice_name`

: String identifier for the prebuilt voice (e.g., "Kore", "Puck", "Charon")** language_code**: ISO 639 language code for speech synthesis (e.g., "en-US", "ja-JP")
- Determines the language and regional accent for synthesized speech
-

**Model-specific behavior:**-

**Half-Cascade models**: Use the specified

`language_code`

for TTS output
- **Native audio models**: May ignore

`language_code`

and automatically determine language from conversation context. Consult model-specific documentation for support.### Available Voices[¶](#available-voices)

The available voices vary by model architecture. To verify which voices are available for your specific model:
- Check the [Gemini Live API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-guide) for the complete list
- Test voice configurations in development before deploying to production
- If a voice is not supported, the Live API will return an error

**Half-cascade models** support these voices:
- Puck
- Charon
- Kore
- Fenrir
- Aoede
- Leda
- Orus
- Zephyr

**Native audio models** support an extended voice list that includes all half-cascade voices plus additional voices from the Text-to-Speech (TTS) service. For the complete list of voices supported by native audio models:
- See the [Gemini Live API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-guide#available-voices)
- Or check the [Text-to-Speech voice list](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices) which native audio models also support

The extended voice list provides more options for voice characteristics, accents, and languages compared to half-cascade models.

### Platform Availability[¶](#platform-availability)

Voice configuration is supported on both platforms, but voice availability may vary:

**Gemini Live API:**

- ✅ Fully supported with documented voice options
- ✅ Half-cascade models: 8 voices (Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, Aoede, Leda, Orus, Zephyr)
- ✅ Native audio models: Extended voice list (see
[documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-guide))

**Vertex AI Live API:**

- ✅ Voice configuration supported
- ⚠️
**Platform-specific difference**: Voice availability may differ from Gemini Live API - ⚠️
**Verification required**: Check[Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)for the current list of supported voices

**Best practice**: Always test your chosen voice configuration on your target platform during development. If a voice is not supported on your platform/model combination, the Live API will return an error at connection time.

### Important Notes[¶](#important-notes)

**Model compatibility**: Voice configuration is only available for Live API models with audio output capabilities**Configuration levels**: You can set`speech_config`

at the agent level (via`Gemini(speech_config=...)`

) or session level (`RunConfig(speech_config=...)`

). Agent-level configuration takes precedence.**Agent-level usage**: To configure voice per agent, create a`Gemini`

instance with`speech_config`

and pass it to`Agent(model=gemini_instance)`

**Default behavior**: If`speech_config`

is not specified at either level, the Live API uses a default voice**Native audio models**: Automatically determine language based on conversation context; explicit`language_code`

may not be supported**Voice availability**: Specific voice names may vary by model; refer to the current Live API documentation for supported voices on your chosen model

## Voice Activity Detection (VAD)[¶](#voice-activity-detection-vad)

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is a Live API feature that automatically detects when users start and stop speaking, enabling natural turn-taking without manual control. VAD is **enabled by default** on all Live API models, allowing the model to automatically manage conversation turns based on detected speech activity.

### How VAD Works[¶](#how-vad-works)

When VAD is enabled (the default), the Live API automatically:

**Detects speech start**: Identifies when a user begins speaking**Detects speech end**: Recognizes when a user stops speaking (natural pauses)**Manages turn-taking**: Allows the model to respond when the user finishes speaking**Handles interruptions**: Enables natural conversation flow with back-and-forth exchanges

This creates a hands-free, natural conversation experience where users don't need to manually signal when they're speaking or done speaking.

### When to Disable VAD[¶](#when-to-disable-vad)

You should disable automatic VAD in these scenarios:

**Push-to-talk implementations**: Your application manually controls when audio should be sent (e.g., audio interaction apps in noisy environments or rooms with cross-talk)**Client-side voice detection**: Your application uses client-side VAD that sends activity signals to your server to reduce CPU and network overhead from continuous audio streaming**Specific UX patterns**: Your design requires users to manually indicate when they're done speaking

When you disable VAD (which is enabled by default), you must use manual activity signals (`ActivityStart`

/`ActivityEnd`

) to control conversation turns. See [Part 2: Activity Signals](../part2/#activity-signals) for details on manual turn control.

### VAD Configurations[¶](#vad-configurations)

**Default behavior (VAD enabled, no configuration needed):**

from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
# VAD is enabled by default - no explicit configuration needed
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"]
)


**Disable automatic VAD (enables manual turn control):**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
realtime_input_config=types.RealtimeInputConfig(
automatic_activity_detection=types.AutomaticActivityDetection(
disabled=True # Disable automatic VAD
)
)
)


### Client-Side VAD Example[¶](#client-side-vad-example)

When building voice-enabled applications, you may want to implement client-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to reduce CPU and network overhead. This pattern combines browser-based VAD with manual activity signals to control when audio is sent to the server.

**The architecture:**

**Client-side**: Browser detects voice activity using Web Audio API (AudioWorklet with RMS-based VAD)**Signal coordination**: Send`activity_start`

when voice detected,`activity_end`

when voice stops**Audio streaming**: Send audio chunks only during active speech periods**Server configuration**: Disable automatic VAD since client handles detection

#### Server-Side Configuration[¶](#server-side-configuration)

**Configuration:**

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode
from google.adk.agents.live_request_queue import LiveRequestQueue
from google.genai import types
# Configure RunConfig to disable automatic VAD
run_config = RunConfig(
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI,
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
realtime_input_config=types.RealtimeInputConfig(
automatic_activity_detection=types.AutomaticActivityDetection(
disabled=True # Client handles VAD
)
)
)


#### WebSocket Upstream Task[¶](#websocket-upstream-task)

**Implementation:**

async def upstream_task(websocket: WebSocket, live_request_queue: LiveRequestQueue):
"""Receives audio and activity signals from client."""
try:
while True:
# Receive JSON message from WebSocket
message = await websocket.receive_json()
if message.get("type") == "activity_start":
# Client detected voice - signal the model
live_request_queue.send_activity_start()
elif message.get("type") == "activity_end":
# Client detected silence - signal the model
live_request_queue.send_activity_end()
elif message.get("type") == "audio":
# Stream audio chunk to the model
import base64
audio_data = base64.b64decode(message["data"])
audio_blob = types.Blob(
mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data=audio_data
)
live_request_queue.send_realtime(audio_blob)
except WebSocketDisconnect:
live_request_queue.close()


#### Client-Side VAD Implementation[¶](#client-side-vad-implementation)

**Implementation:**

// vad-processor.js - AudioWorklet processor for voice detection
class VADProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
constructor() {
super();
this.threshold = 0.05; // Adjust based on environment
}
process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {
const input = inputs[0];
if (input && input.length > 0) {
const channelData = input[0];
let sum = 0;
// Calculate RMS (Root Mean Square)
for (let i = 0; i < channelData.length; i++) {
sum += channelData[i] ** 2;
}
const rms = Math.sqrt(sum / channelData.length);
// Signal voice detection status
this.port.postMessage({
voice: rms > this.threshold,
rms: rms
});
}
return true;
}
}
registerProcessor('vad-processor', VADProcessor);


#### Client-Side Coordination[¶](#client-side-coordination)

**Coordinating VAD Signals:**

// Main application logic
let isSilence = true;
let lastVoiceTime = 0;
const SILENCE_TIMEOUT = 2000; // 2 seconds of silence before sending activity_end
// Set up VAD processor
const vadNode = new AudioWorkletNode(audioContext, 'vad-processor');
vadNode.port.onmessage = (event) => {
const { voice, rms } = event.data;
if (voice) {
// Voice detected
if (isSilence) {
// Transition from silence to speech - send activity_start
websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "activity_start" }));
isSilence = false;
}
lastVoiceTime = Date.now();
} else {
// No voice detected - check if silence timeout exceeded
if (!isSilence && Date.now() - lastVoiceTime > SILENCE_TIMEOUT) {
// Sustained silence - send activity_end
websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "activity_end" }));
isSilence = true;
}
}
};
// Set up audio recorder to stream chunks
audioRecorderNode.port.onmessage = (event) => {
const audioData = event.data; // Float32Array
// Only send audio when voice is detected
if (!isSilence) {
// Convert to PCM16 and send to server
const pcm16 = convertFloat32ToPCM(audioData);
const base64Audio = arrayBufferToBase64(pcm16);
websocket.send(JSON.stringify({
type: "audio",
mime_type: "audio/pcm;rate=16000",
data: base64Audio
}));
}
};


**Key Implementation Details:**

-
**RMS-Based Voice Detection**: The AudioWorklet processor calculates Root Mean Square (RMS) of audio samples to detect voice activity. RMS provides a simple but effective measure of audio energy that can distinguish speech from silence. -
**Adjustable Threshold**: The`threshold`

value (0.05 in the example) can be tuned based on the environment. Lower thresholds are more sensitive (detect quieter speech but may trigger on background noise), higher thresholds require louder speech. -
**Silence Timeout**: Use a timeout (e.g., 2000ms) before sending`activity_end`

to avoid prematurely ending a turn during natural pauses in speech. This creates a more natural conversation flow. -
**State Management**: Track`isSilence`

state to detect transitions between silence and speech. Send`activity_start`

only on silence→speech transitions, and`activity_end`

only after sustained silence. -
**Conditional Audio Streaming**: Only send audio chunks when`!isSilence`

to reduce bandwidth. This can save ~50-90% of network traffic depending on the conversation's speech-to-silence ratio. -
**AudioWorklet Thread Separation**: The VAD processor runs on the audio rendering thread, ensuring real-time performance without being affected by main thread JavaScript execution or network delays.

#### Benefits of Client-Side VAD[¶](#benefits-of-client-side-vad)

This pattern provides several advantages:

**Reduced CPU and network overhead**: Only send audio during active speech, not continuous silence**Faster response**: Immediate local detection without server round-trip**Better control**: Fine-tune VAD sensitivity based on client environment

Activity Signal Timing

When using manual activity signals with client-side VAD:

- Always send
`activity_start`

**before**sending the first audio chunk - Always send
`activity_end`

**after**sending the last audio chunk - The model will only process audio between
`activity_start`

and`activity_end`

signals - Incorrect timing may cause the model to ignore audio or produce unexpected behavior

## Proactivity and Affective Dialog[¶](#proactivity-and-affective-dialog)

The Live API offers advanced conversational features that enable more natural and context-aware interactions. **Proactive audio** allows the model to intelligently decide when to respond, offer suggestions without explicit prompts, or ignore irrelevant input. **Affective dialog** enables the model to detect and adapt to emotional cues in voice tone and content, adjusting its response style for more empathetic interactions. These features are currently supported only on native audio models.

**Configuration:**

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig
run_config = RunConfig(
# Model can initiate responses without explicit prompts
proactivity=types.ProactivityConfig(proactive_audio=True),
# Model adapts to user emotions
enable_affective_dialog=True
)


**Proactivity:**

When enabled, the model can:

- Offer suggestions without being asked
- Provide follow-up information proactively
- Ignore irrelevant or off-topic input
- Anticipate user needs based on context

**Affective Dialog:**

The model analyzes emotional cues in voice tone and content to:

- Detect user emotions (frustrated, happy, confused, etc.)
- Adapt response style and tone accordingly
- Provide empathetic responses in customer service scenarios
- Adjust formality based on detected sentiment

**Practical Example - Customer Service Bot**:

from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode
# Configure for empathetic customer service
run_config = RunConfig(
response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI,
# Model can proactively offer help
proactivity=types.ProactivityConfig(proactive_audio=True),
# Model adapts to customer emotions
enable_affective_dialog=True
)
# Example interaction (illustrative - actual model behavior may vary):
# Customer: "I've been waiting for my order for three weeks..."
# [Model may detect frustration in tone and adapt response]
# Model: "I'm really sorry to hear about this delay. Let me check your order
# status right away. Can you provide your order number?"
#
# [Proactivity in action]
# Model: "I see you previously asked about shipping updates. Would you like
# me to set up notifications for future orders?"
#
# Note: Proactive and affective behaviors are probabilistic. The model's
# emotional awareness and proactive suggestions will vary based on context,
# conversation history, and inherent model variability.


### Platform Compatibility[¶](#platform-compatibility)

These features are **model-specific** and have platform implications:

**Gemini Live API:**

- ✅ Supported on
`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`

(native audio model) - ❌ Not supported on
`gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview`

(half-cascade model)

**Vertex AI Live API:**

- ❌ Not currently supported on
`gemini-live-2.5-flash`

(half-cascade model) - ⚠️
**Platform-specific difference**: Proactivity and affective dialog require native audio models, which are currently only available on Gemini Live API

**Key insight**: If your application requires proactive audio or affective dialog features, you must use Gemini Live API with a native audio model. Half-cascade models on either platform do not support these features.

**Testing Proactivity**:

To verify proactive behavior is working:

-
**Create open-ended context**: Provide information without asking questions -
**Test emotional response**: -
**Monitor for unprompted responses**:- Model should occasionally offer relevant information
- Should ignore truly irrelevant input
- Should anticipate user needs based on context


**When to Disable**:

Consider disabling proactivity/affective dialog for:
- **Formal/professional contexts** where emotional adaptation is inappropriate
- **High-precision tasks** where predictability is critical
- **Accessibility applications** where consistent behavior is expected
- **Testing/debugging** where deterministic behavior is needed
