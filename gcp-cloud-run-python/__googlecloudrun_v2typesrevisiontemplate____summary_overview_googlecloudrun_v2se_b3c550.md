ListJobsPager(
method: typing.Callable[[...], google.cloud.run_v2.types.job.ListJobsResponse],
request: google.cloud.run_v2.types.job.ListJobsRequest,
response: google.cloud.run_v2.types.job.ListJobsResponse,

```


A pager for iterating through `list_jobs`

requests.

This class thinly wraps an initial
[ListJobsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListJobsResponse) object, and
provides an `__iter__`

method to iterate through its
`jobs`

field.

If there are more pages, the `__iter__`

method will make additional
`ListJobs`

requests and continue to iterate
through the `jobs`

field on the
corresponding responses.

All the usual [ListJobsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListJobsResponse)
attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.

## Methods

*,
retry: typing.Optional[

A pager for iterating through `list_tasks`

requests.

This class thinly wraps an initial
[ListTasksResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListTasksResponse) object, and
provides an `__iter__`

method to iterate through its
`tasks`

field.

method will make additional
`ListTasks`

requests and continue to iterate
through the `tasks`

field on the
corresponding responses.

All the usual [ListTasksResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListTasksResponse)
attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.

# Class EmptyDirVolumeSource (0.15.0)

`EmptyDirVolumeSource(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`

`size_limit` |
`str`
Limit on the storage usable by this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers. The default is nil which means that the limit is undefined. More info: https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/in-memory-volumes#configure-volume.

# Class VersionToPath (0.15.0)

`VersionToPath(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


VersionToPath maps a specific version of a secret to a relative file to mount to, relative to VolumeMount's mount_path.

## Attributes |
|
|---|---|
Name |
Description |
`path` |
`str`
Required. The relative path of the secret in the container. |
`version` |
`str`
The Cloud Secret Manager secret version. Can be 'latest' for the latest value, or an integer or a secret alias for a specific version. |
`mode` |
`int`
Integer octal mode bits to use on this file, must be a value between 01 and 0777 (octal). If 0 or not set, the Volume's default mode will be used. Notes - Internally, a umask of 0222 will be applied to any non-zero value. - This is an integer representation of the mode bits. So, the octal integer value should look exactly as the chmod numeric notation with a leading zero. Some examples: for chmod 640 (u=rw,g=r), set to 0640 (octal) or 416 (base-10). For chmod 755 (u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx), set to 0755 (octal) or 493 (base-10). - This might be in conflict with other options that affect the file mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set. |
