# Class ExecutionTemplate (0.14.0)

`ExecutionTemplate(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


ExecutionTemplate describes the data an execution should have when created from a template.

## Attributes |
|
|---|---|
Name |
Description |
`labels` |
`MutableMapping[str, str]`
Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter, or break down billing charges by team, component, environment, state, etc. For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels or https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels. .. raw:: html Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with |
`annotations` |
`MutableMapping[str, str]`
Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. .. raw:: html Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with This field follows Kubernetes annotations' namespacing, limits, and rules. |
`parallelism` |
`int`
Optional. Specifies the maximum desired number of tasks the execution should run at given time. When the job is run, if this field is 0 or unset, the maximum possible value will be used for that execution. The actual number of tasks running in steady state will be less than this number when there are fewer tasks waiting to be completed remaining, i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism. |
`task_count` |
`int`
Specifies the desired number of tasks the execution should run. Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that task signals the success of the execution. Defaults to 1. |
`template` |
Required. Describes the task(s) that will be created when executing an execution. |

# Module pagers (0.14.0)

API documentation for `run_v2.services.jobs.pagers`

module.

## Classes

[ListJobsAsyncPager](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.services.jobs.pagers.ListJobsAsyncPager)

```
ListJobsAsyncPager(
method: typing.Callable[
[...], typing.Awaitable[google.cloud.run_v2.types.job.ListJobsResponse]
],
request: google.cloud.run_v2.types.job.ListJobsRequest,

```


A pager for iterating through `list_jobs`

requests.

This class thinly wraps an initial
[ListJobsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListJobsResponse) object, and
provides an `__aiter__`

method to iterate through its
`jobs`

field.

If there are more pages, the `__aiter__`

method will make additional
`ListJobs`

requests and continue to iterate
through the `jobs`

field on the
corresponding responses.

All the usual [ListJobsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListJobsResponse)
attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.
