`reconciling` |
`bool`
Output only. Returns true if the Instance is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new Instance is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the Instance to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation` will have a transient
value that might mismatch the intended state. Once
reconciliation is over (and this field is false), there are
two possible outcomes: reconciliation succeeded and the
serving state matches the Instance, or there was an error,
and reconciliation failed. This state can be found in
`terminal_condition.state` .
