Optional. Name of the function target if the source is a function source. Required for function builds. |
`cache_image_uri` |
`str`
Optional. cache_image_uri is the GCR/AR URL where the cache image will be stored. cache_image_uri is optional and omitting it will disable caching. This URL must be stable across builds. It is used to derive a build-specific temporary URL by substituting the tag with the build ID. The build will clean up the temporary image on a best-effort basis. |
`base_image` |
`str`
Optional. The base image to use for the build. |
`environment_variables` |
`MutableMapping[str, str]`
Optional. User-provided build-time environment variables. |
`enable_automatic_updates` |
