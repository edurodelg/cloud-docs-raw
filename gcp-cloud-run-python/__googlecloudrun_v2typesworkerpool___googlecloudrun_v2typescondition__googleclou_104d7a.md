# Class WorkerPool (0.15.0)

`WorkerPool(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


WorkerPool acts as a top-level container that manages a set of configurations and revision templates which implement a pull-based workload. WorkerPool exists to provide a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about, and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout policy and team resource ownership.

## Attributes |
|
|---|---|
Name |
Description |
`name` |
`str`
The fully qualified name of this WorkerPool. In CreateWorkerPoolRequest, this field is ignored, and instead composed from CreateWorkerPoolRequest.parent and CreateWorkerPoolRequest.worker_id. Format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workerPools/{worker_id}`
|
`description` |
`str`
User-provided description of the WorkerPool. This field currently has a 512-character limit. |
`uid` |
`str`
Output only. Server assigned unique identifier for the trigger. The value is a UUID4 string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until the resource is deleted. |
`generation` |
`int`
Output only. A number that monotonically increases every time the user modifies the desired state. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a `string` instead of an
`integer` .
|
`labels` |
`MutableMapping[str, str]`
Optional. Unstructured key value map that can be used to organize and categorize objects. User-provided labels are shared with Google's billing system, so they can be used to filter, or break down billing charges by team, component, environment, state, etc. For more information, visit https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels or https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/labels. Cloud Run API v2 does not support labels with `run.googleapis.com` , `cloud.googleapis.com` ,
`serving.knative.dev` , or `autoscaling.knative.dev`
namespaces, and they will be rejected. All system labels in
v1 now have a corresponding field in v2 WorkerPool.
|
`annotations` |
`MutableMapping[str, str]`
Optional. Unstructured key value map that may be set by external tools to store and arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. Cloud Run API v2 does not support annotations with `run.googleapis.com` , `cloud.googleapis.com` ,
`serving.knative.dev` , or `autoscaling.knative.dev`
namespaces, and they will be rejected in new resources. All
system annotations in v1 now have a corresponding field in
v2 WorkerPool.
.. raw:: html
This field follows Kubernetes annotations' namespacing, limits, and rules. |
`create_time` |
`google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp`
Output only. The creation time. |
`update_time` |
`google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp`
Output only. The last-modified time. |
`delete_time` |
`google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp`
Output only. The deletion time. It is only populated as a response to a Delete request. |

Output only. For a deleted resource, the time after which it will be permamently deleted. |
`creator` |
`str`
Output only. Email address of the authenticated creator. |
`last_modifier` |
`str`
Output only. Email address of the last authenticated modifier. |
`client` |
`str`
Arbitrary identifier for the API client. |
`client_version` |
`str`
Arbitrary version identifier for the API client. |
`launch_stage` |
`google.api.launch_stage_pb2.LaunchStage`
Optional. The launch stage as defined by `Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages |
`binary_authorization` |
Optional. Settings for the Binary Authorization feature. |
`template` |
Required. The template used to create revisions for this WorkerPool. |
`instance_splits` |
`MutableSequence[`
Optional. Specifies how to distribute instances over a collection of Revisions belonging to the WorkerPool. If instance split is empty or not provided, defaults to 100% instances assigned to the latest `Ready` Revision.
|
`scaling` |
Optional. Specifies worker-pool-level scaling settings |
`observed_generation` |
`int`
Output only. The generation of this WorkerPool currently serving workloads. See comments in `reconciling` for
additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
Run. Please note that unlike v1, this is an int64 value. As
with most Google APIs, its JSON representation will be a
`string` instead of an `integer` .
|
`terminal_condition` |
Output only. The Condition of this WorkerPool, containing its readiness status, and detailed error information in case it did not reach a serving state. See comments in `reconciling` for additional information on reconciliation
process in Cloud Run.
|
`conditions` |
`MutableSequence[`
Output only. The Conditions of all other associated sub-resources. They contain additional diagnostics information in case the WorkerPool does not reach its Serving state. See comments in `reconciling` for
additional information on reconciliation process in Cloud
Run.
|
`latest_ready_revision` |
`str`
Output only. Name of the latest revision that is serving workloads. See comments in `reconciling` for additional
information on reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
|
`latest_created_revision` |
`str`

reconciliation process in Cloud Run.
|

`satisfies_pzs` |
`bool`
Output only. Reserved for future use. |
`reconciling` |
`bool`
Output only. Returns true if the WorkerPool is currently being acted upon by the system to bring it into the desired state. When a new WorkerPool is created, or an existing one is updated, Cloud Run will asynchronously perform all necessary steps to bring the WorkerPool to the desired serving state. This process is called reconciliation. While reconciliation is in process, `observed_generation` ,
`latest_ready_revison` , `instance_split_statuses` , and
`uri` will have transient values that might mismatch the
intended state: Once reconciliation is over (and this field
is false), there are two possible outcomes: reconciliation
succeeded and the serving state matches the WorkerPool, or
there was an error, and reconciliation failed. This state
can be found in `terminal_condition.state` .
If reconciliation succeeded, the following fields will
match: `instance_splits` and `instance_split_statuses` ,
`observed_generation` and `generation` ,
`latest_ready_revision` and `latest_created_revision` .
If reconciliation failed, `instance_split_statuses` ,
`observed_generation` , and `latest_ready_revision` will
have the state of the last serving revision, or empty for
newly created WorkerPools. Additional information on the
failure can be found in `terminal_condition` and
`conditions` .
|
`etag` |
`str`
Optional. A system-generated fingerprint for this version of the resource. May be used to detect modification conflict during updates. |

# Class EnvVar (0.15.0)

`EnvVar(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


EnvVar represents an environment variable present in a Container.

This message has `oneof`

_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.

.. _oneof: [https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields](https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields)

Name |
Description |
`name` |
`str`
Required. Name of the environment variable. Must not exceed 32768 characters. |
`value` |
`str`
Literal value of the environment variable. Defaults to "", and the maximum length is 32768 bytes. Variable references are not supported in Cloud Run. This field is a member of `oneof` _ `values` .
|
`value_source` |
Source for the environment variable's value. This field is a member of `oneof` _ `values` .
