# Class Condition (0.14.0)

`Condition(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


Defines a status condition for a resource.

This message has `oneof`

_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
members.
