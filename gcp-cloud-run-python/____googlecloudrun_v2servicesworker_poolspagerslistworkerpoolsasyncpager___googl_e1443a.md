ListWorkerPoolsAsyncPager(
method: typing.Callable[

A pager for iterating through `list_worker_pools`

requests.

This class thinly wraps an initial
[ListWorkerPoolsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListWorkerPoolsResponse) object, and
provides an `__aiter__`

method to iterate through its
`worker_pools`

field.

If there are more pages, the `__aiter__`

method will make additional
`ListWorkerPools`

requests and continue to iterate
through the `worker_pools`

field on the
corresponding responses.

All the usual [ListWorkerPoolsResponse](/python/docs/reference/run/latest/google.cloud.run_v2.types.ListWorkerPoolsResponse)
attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.

## Methods

### ListWorkerPoolsAsyncPager

```
ListWorkerPoolsAsyncPager(
method: typing.Callable[
[...],
typing.Awaitable[google.cloud.run_v2.types.worker_pool.ListWorkerPoolsResponse],
],
request: google.cloud.run_v2.types.worker_pool.ListWorkerPoolsRequest,
response: google.cloud.run_v2.types.worker_pool.ListWorkerPoolsResponse,
*,
retry: typing.Optional[
typing.Union[
google.api_core.retry.retry_unary_async.AsyncRetry,
google.api_core.gapic_v1.method._MethodDefault,
]
] = _MethodDefault._DEFAULT_VALUE,
timeout: typing.Union[float, object] = _MethodDefault._DEFAULT_VALUE,
