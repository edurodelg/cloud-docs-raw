# Quickstart: Respond to blob storage events by using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you use Visual Studio Code to build an app that responds to events in a Blob Storage container. After testing the code locally by using an emulator, you deploy it to a new serverless function app running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project uses the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`

) extension with Visual Studio Code to simplify initializing and verifying your project code locally, as well as deploying your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

This article supports version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions.

This article supports version 2 of the Python programming model for Azure Functions.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)on one of the[supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).The

[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)for Visual Studio Code. This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local). When this tool isn't available locally, the extension tries to install it by using a package-based installer. You can also install or update the Core Tools package by running`Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools`

from the command palette. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead[manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

[C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)for Visual Studio Code.

The

[Java Development Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure), version 8, 11, 17 or 21 (Linux).[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org), version 3.0 or above.

[Node.js 18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)or above. Use the`node --version`

command to check your version.

Python versions that are

[supported by Azure Functions](supported-languages#languages-by-runtime-version). For more information, see[How to install Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).The

[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)for Visual Studio Code.

- The
[Azure Developer CLI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-dev)for Visual Studio Code.

[REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)or an equivalent REST tool you use to securely execute HTTP requests.

## Initialize the project

Use the `azd init`

command from the command palette to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace where you want to create your project.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Initialize App (init)`

, then choose**Select a template**.There might be a slight delay while

`azd`

initializes the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions C# Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-dotnet`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions Python Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-python`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions TypeScript Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-typescript`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions Java Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-java`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-java-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions PowerShell Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-powershell`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

In `azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

## Add the local.settings.json file

Functions needs the local.settings.json file to configure the host when running locally.

Run this command to go to the

`src`

app folder:`cd src`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "java", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "powershell", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION": "7.2", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


## Create and activate a virtual environment

In the `src`

folder, run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python doesn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


## Set up local storage emulator

Use the Azurite emulator to run your code project locally before creating and using Azure resources.

If you haven't already,

[install Azurite](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite#install-azurite).Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azurite: Start`

to start the local storage emulator.In the

**Azure**area, expand**Workspace**>**Attached Storage Accounts**>**Local Emulator**, right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac)**Blob Containers**, select**Create Blob Container...**, and create these two blob storage containers in the local emulator:`unprocessed-pdf`

: container that the trigger monitors for storage events.`processed-pdf`

: container where the function sends processed blobs as output.

Expand

**Blob Containers**, right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac)**unprocessed-pdf**, select**Upload Files...**, press`Enter`to accept the root directory, and upload the PDF files from the`data`

project folder.

When running locally, you can use REST to trigger the function by simulating the function receiving a message from an event subscription.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer by using the Azurite emulator. The `PDFProcessorSTORAGE`

environment variable defines the storage account connection, which is also set to `"UseDevelopmentStorage=true"`

in the local.settings.json file when running locally.

Run this command from the

`src`

project folder in a terminal or command prompt:`func start`

`mvn clean package mvn azure-functions:run`

`npm install func start`

`npm install npm start`

When the Functions host starts, it writes the name of the trigger and the trigger type to the terminal output. In Functions, the project root folder contains the host.json file.

With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, open the`test.http`

file in your project and select**Send Request**to trigger the`ProcessBlobUpload`

function by sending a test blob event to the blob event webhook.This step simulates receiving an event from an event subscription when running locally, and you should see the request and processed file information written in the logs. If you aren't using

*REST Client*, you must use another secure REST tool to call the endpoint with the payload in`test.http`

.In the Workspace area for the blob container, expand

**processed-pdf**and verify that the function processed the PDF file and copied it with a`processed-`

prefix.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload.cs project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/ProcessBlobUpload.cs). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`BlobTrigger`

with`Source = BlobTriggerSource.EventGrid`

for near real-time processing - Bind to
`BlobClient`

for the source blob and`BlobContainerClient`

for the destination - Process blob content and copy it to another container by using streams

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [function_app.py project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/function_app.py). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`@app.blob_trigger`

with`source="EventGrid"`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using the
`InputStream`

parameter - Copy processed files to the destination container using the Azure Storage SDK

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [processBlobUpload.ts project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/functions/processBlobUpload.ts). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`app.storageBlob()`

with`source: 'EventGrid'`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using the Node.js Azure Storage SDK
- Process and copy files to the destination container asynchronously

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload.java project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-java-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/samples/ProcessBlobUpload.java). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`@BlobTrigger`

with`source = "EventGrid"`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using
`BlobInputStream`

parameter - Copy processed files to the destination container using Azure Storage SDK for Java

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload/run.ps1 project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/processBlobUpload/run.ps1) and the corresponding [function.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/processBlobUpload/function.json). The function demonstrates how to:

- Configure blob trigger with
`"source": "EventGrid"`

in function.json for near real-time processing - Access blob content using PowerShell Azure Storage cmdlets
- Process and copy files to the destination container using Azure PowerShell modules

After you review and verify your function code locally, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Create Azure resources and deploy

Use the `azd up`

command to create the function app in a Flex Consumption plan along with other required Azure resources, including the event subscription. After the infrastructure is ready, `azd`

also deploys your project code to the new function app in Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Sign In with Azure Developer CLI`

, then sign in by using your Azure account.In the project root, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Provision and Deploy (up)`

to create the required Azure resources and deploy your code.When prompted in the Terminal window, provide these required deployment parameters:

Prompt Description Select an Azure Subscription to use Choose the subscription in which you want to create your resources. *Environment name*An environment that's used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. The

`azd up`

command uses your responses to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to create and configure these required Azure resources, following the latest best practices:- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Storage account with blob containers
- Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Event Grid subscription for blob events
- Service-to-service connections by using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)

After the command completes successfully, your app runs in Azure with an event subscription configured to trigger your function when blobs are added to the

`unprocessed-pdf`

container.Make a note of the

`AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

and`AZURE_FUNCTION_APP_NAME`

in the output. These names are unique for your storage account and function app in Azure, respectively.

## Verify the deployed function

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Storage: Upload Files...`

. Accept the root directory, and as before, upload one or more PDF files from the`data`

project folder.When prompted, select the name of your new storage account (from

`AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

). Select**Blob Containers**>**unprocessed-pdf**.Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Storage: Open in Explorer`

. Select the same storage account >**Blob Containers**>**processed-pdf**, then**Open in new window**.In the Explorer, verify that the PDF files you uploaded were processed by your function. The output is written to the

`processed-pdf`

container with a`processed-`

prefix.

The Event Grid blob trigger processes files within seconds of upload. This speed demonstrates the near real-time capabilities of this approach compared to traditional polling-based blob triggers.

## Redeploy your code

Run the `azd up`

command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that were used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure. This action helps you avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

## Usage

Changing the default embeddings `model`

changes the way that embeddings are stored in the vector database. Changing the default model can cause the lookups to start misbehaving when they don't match the rest of the data that was previously ingested into the vector database. The default model for embeddings is `text-embedding-ada-002`

.

When calculating the maximum character length for input chunks, consider that the maximum input tokens allowed for second-generation input embedding models like `text-embedding-ada-002`

is `8191`

. A single token is approximately four characters in length (in English), which translates to roughly 32,000 (English) characters of input that can fit into a single chunk.

# Choose the right integration and automation services in Azure

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article compares the following Microsoft cloud services:

[Microsoft Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/)(was Microsoft Flow)[Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/)[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/)[Azure App Service WebJobs](../app-service/webjobs-create)

All of these services can solve integration problems and automate business processes. They can all define input, actions, conditions, and output. You can run each of them on a schedule or trigger. Each service has unique advantages, and this article explains the differences.

Note

If you're looking for a more general comparison between Azure Functions and other Azure compute options, see the following articles:

For a summary and comparison of automation service options in Azure,
see [Choose the Automation services in Azure](../automation/automation-services).

## Compare Azure Logic Apps and Microsoft Power Automate

These services are both *designer-first* integration platforms where you can build and run automated workflows. Both platforms integrate with various Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and enterprise applications. Both provide similar workflow designers, and while [their connectors share some overlap](/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/), each platform also offers their own unique connectors.

Power Automate empowers business users, office workers, and citizen developers to build simple integrations without having to work with IT or developers or to write code. One example might be an approval workflow for a SharePoint document library. Azure Logic Apps supports integrations ranging from little-to-no-code scenarios to more advanced, codeful, and complex workflows. Examples include B2B processes or scenarios that require enterprise-level interactions with Azure DevOps. A business workflow can also grow from simple to complete over time.

To help you determine whether you want to use Azure Logic Apps or Power Automate for a specific integration, see the [Capability comparison table](/en-us/azure/logic-apps/power-automate-migration#compare-capability-details).

## Compare Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps

These Azure services enable you to build and run serverless workloads. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, while Azure Logic Apps is a serverless workflow integration platform. Both can create complex *orchestrations*. An orchestration is a collection of functions, which are called *actions* in Azure Logic Apps, that you can run to complete a complex task. For example, to process a batch of orders, you might execute many instances of a function in parallel, wait for all instances to finish, and then execute a function that computes a result on the aggregate.

For Azure Functions, you develop orchestrations by writing code and using the [Durable Functions extension](durable/durable-functions-overview). For Azure Logic Apps, you create orchestrations by using a visual designer or by editing Azure Resource Manager templates.

You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration. For example, you can call functions from logic app workflows and call logic app workflows from functions. Choose how to build each orchestration based on the services' capabilities or your personal preference. The following table lists some key differences between these services:

## Compare Functions and WebJobs

Like Azure Functions, Azure App Service WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK is a *code-first* integration service that is designed for developers. Both are built on [Azure App Service](../app-service/overview) and support features such as [source control integration](../app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment), [authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization), and [monitoring with Application Insights integration](functions-monitoring).

### WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK

You can use the *WebJobs* feature of App Service to run a script or code in the context of an App Service web app. The *WebJobs SDK* is a framework designed for WebJobs that simplifies the code you write to respond to events in Azure services. For example, you might respond to the creation of an image blob in Azure Storage by creating a thumbnail image. The WebJobs SDK runs as a .NET console application, which you can deploy to a WebJob.

WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK work best together, but you can use WebJobs without the WebJobs SDK and vice versa. A WebJob can run any program or script that runs in the App Service sandbox. A WebJobs SDK console application can run anywhere console applications run, such as on-premises servers.

### Comparison table

Azure Functions is built on the WebJobs SDK, so it shares many of the same event triggers and connections to other Azure services. Here are some factors to consider when you're choosing between Azure Functions and WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK:

| Functions | WebJobs with WebJobs SDK | |
|---|---|---|
|
✔ | |
|
✔ | |
|
✔ | |
|
✔ | |
Trigger events |

[Timer](functions-bindings-timer)[Azure Storage queues and blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob)[Azure Service Bus queues and topics](functions-bindings-service-bus)[Azure Cosmos DB](functions-bindings-cosmosdb)[Azure Event Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs)[File system](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions/Extensions/Files/FileTriggerAttribute.cs)**Supported languages**F#

JavaScript

Java

Python

PowerShell

1**Package managers**21 WebJobs (without the WebJobs SDK) supports languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, Bash, .cmd, .bat, PowerShell, PHP, TypeScript, Python, and more. A WebJob can run any program or script that can run in the App Service sandbox.

2 WebJobs (without the WebJobs SDK) supports npm and NuGet.

### Summary

Azure Functions offers more developer productivity than Azure App Service WebJobs does. It also offers more options for programming languages, development environments, Azure service integration, and pricing. For most scenarios, it's the best choice.

Here are two scenarios for which WebJobs might be the best choice:

- You need more control over the code that listens for events, the
`JobHost`

object. Functions offers a limited number of ways to customize`JobHost`

behavior in the[host.json](functions-host-json)file. Sometimes you need to do things that you can't specify by using a string in a JSON file. For example, only the WebJobs SDK lets you configure a custom retry policy for Azure Storage. - You have an App Service app for which you want to run code snippets, and you want to manage them together in the same Azure DevOps environment.

For other scenarios where you want to run code snippets for integrating Azure or external services, choose Azure Functions over WebJobs with the WebJobs SDK.

## Power Automate, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs together

You don't have to choose just one of these services. They integrate with each other and with external services.

A Power Automate flow can call an Azure Logic Apps workflow. An Azure Logic Apps workflow can call a function in Azure Functions, and vice versa. For example, see [Create a function that integrates with Azure Logic Apps](functions-twitter-email).

Between Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, and Functions, the integration experience between these services continues to improve over time. You can build a component in one service and use that component in the other services.

For more information about integration services, see the following articles:

[Leveraging Azure Functions & Azure App Service for integration scenarios by Christopher Anderson](https://www.biztalk360.com/integrate-2016-resources/leveraging-azure-functions-azure-app-service-integration-scenarios/)[Integrations Made Simple by Charles Lamanna](https://www.biztalk360.com/integrate-2016-resources/integrations-made-simple/)[Azure Logic Apps Live webcast](https://aka.ms/logicappslive)[Power Automate frequently asked questions](/en-us/power-automate/frequently-asked-questions)

# Azure Cache for Redis input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When a function runs, the Azure Cache for Redis input binding retrieves data from a cache and passes it to your function as an input parameter.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-cache).

## Scope of availability for functions bindings

| Binding Type | Azure Managed Redis | Azure Cache for Redis |
|---|---|---|
| Input | Yes | Yes |

Important

When using Azure Managed Redis or the Enterprise tiers of Azure Cache for Redis, use port 10000 rather than port 6380 or 6379.

Important

The Node.js v4 model for Functions isn't yet supported by the Azure Cache for Redis extension. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Important

The Python v2 model for Functions isn't yet supported by the Azure Cache for Redis extension. For more details about how the v2 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators).

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

For .NET functions, using the *isolated worker* model is recommended over the *in-process* model. For a comparison of the *in-process* and *isolated worker* models, see differences between the *isolated worker* model and the *in-process* model for .NET on Azure Functions.

The following code uses the key from the pub/sub trigger to obtain and log the value from an input binding using a `GET`

command:

```
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Redis.Samples.RedisInputBinding
{
public class SetGetter
{
private readonly ILogger<SetGetter> logger;
public SetGetter(ILogger<SetGetter> logger)
{
this.logger = logger;
}
[Function(nameof(SetGetter))]
public void Run(
[RedisPubSubTrigger(Common.connectionStringSetting, "__keyevent@0__:set")] string key,
[RedisInput(Common.connectionStringSetting, "GET {Message}")] string value)
{
logger.LogInformation($"Key '{key}' was set to value '{value}'");
}
}
}
```


More samples for the Azure Cache for Redis input binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-redis-extension).

The following code uses the key from the pub/sub trigger to obtain and log the value from an input binding using a `GET`

command:

```
package com.function.RedisInputBinding;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.redis.annotation.*;
public class SetGetter {
@FunctionName("SetGetter")
public void run(
@RedisPubSubTrigger(
name = "key",
connection = "redisConnectionString",
channel = "__keyevent@0__:set")
String key,
@RedisInput(
name = "value",
connection = "redisConnectionString",
command = "GET {Message}")
String value,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Key '" + key + "' was set to value '" + value + "'");
}
}
```


This function.json defines both a pub/sub trigger and an input binding to the GET message on an Azure Cache for Redis instance:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
"name": "key",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"type": "redis",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"command": "GET {Message}",
"name": "value",
"direction": "in"
}
],
"scriptFile": "index.js"
}
```


This JavaScript code (from index.js) retrieves and logs the cached value related to the key provided by the pub/sub trigger.

```
module.exports = async function (context, key, value) {
context.log("Key '" + key + "' was set to value '" + value + "'");
}
```


This function.json defines both a pub/sub trigger and an input binding to the GET message on an Azure Cache for Redis instance:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
"name": "key",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"type": "redis",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"command": "GET {Message}",
"name": "value",
"direction": "in"
}
],
"scriptFile": "run.ps1"
}
```


This PowerShell code (from run.ps1) retrieves and logs the cached value related to the key provided by the pub/sub trigger.

```
param($key, $value, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "Key '$key' was set to value '$value'"
```


The following example uses a pub/sub trigger with an input binding to the GET message on an Azure Cache for Redis instance. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

This function.json defines both a pub/sub trigger and an input binding to the GET message on an Azure Cache for Redis instance:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "redisPubSubTrigger",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"channel": "__keyevent@0__:set",
"name": "key",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"type": "redis",
"connection": "redisConnectionString",
"command": "GET {Message}",
"name": "value",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


This Python code (from __init__.py) retrieves and logs the cached value related to the key provided by the pub/sub trigger:

```
import logging
def main(key: str, value: str):
logging.info("Key '" + key + "' was set to value '" + value + "'")
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

## Attributes

Note

Not all commands are supported for this binding. At the moment, only read commands that return a single output are supported. The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-redis-extension/blob/main/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Redis/Bindings/RedisAsyncConverter.cs#L63)

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
`Connection` |
The name of the
`<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |

`Command`

`GET key`

, `HGET key field`

.## Annotations

The `RedisInput`

annotation supports these properties:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`name` |
The name of the specific input binding. |
`connection` |
The name of the
`<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |

`command`

`GET key`

or `HGET key field`

.## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
`connection` |
The name of the
`<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |

`command`

`GET key`

, `HGET key field`

.Note

Python v2 and Node.js v4 for Functions don't use function.json to define the function. Both of these new language versions aren't currently supported by Azure Redis Cache bindings.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The input binding expects to receive a string from the cache.

When you use a custom type as the binding parameter, the extension tries to deserialize a JSON-formatted string into the custom type of this parameter.

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities to authorize requests against your cache, if possible. Authorization by using Microsoft Entra ID and managed identities provides superior security and ease of use over shared access key authorization. For more information about using managed identities with your cache, see [Use Microsoft Entra ID for cache authentication](/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-azure-active-directory-for-authentication).

# MCP tool trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the MCP tool trigger to define tool endpoints in a [Model Content Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) server. Client language models and agents can use tools to perform specific tasks, such as storing or accessing code snippets.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-mcp).

## Example

Note

For C#, the Azure Functions MCP extension supports only the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `SaveSnippet`

that tries to persist a named code snippet to blob storage.

```
private const string BlobPath = "snippets/{mcptoolargs.snippetname}.json";
[Function(nameof(SaveSnippet))]
[BlobOutput(BlobPath)]
public string SaveSnippet(
[McpToolTrigger("save_snippet", "Saves a code snippet into your snippet collection.")]
ToolInvocationContext context,
[McpToolProperty("snippetname", "The name of the snippet.", isRequired: true)]
string name,
[McpToolProperty("snippet", "The code snippet.", isRequired: true)]
string snippet
)
{
return snippet;
}
```


This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `GetSnippet`

that tries to retrieve a code snippet by name from blob storage.

```
private const string BlobPath = "snippets/{mcptoolargs.snippetname}.json";
[Function(nameof(GetSnippet))]
public object GetSnippet(
[McpToolTrigger("get_snippets", "Gets code snippets from your snippet collection.")]
ToolInvocationContext context,
[BlobInput(BlobPath)] string snippetContent
)
{
return snippetContent;
}
```


The tool properties for the `GetSnippet`

function are configured in `Program.cs`

:

```
var builder = FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication();
builder.Services
.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryWorkerService()
.ConfigureFunctionsApplicationInsights();
builder
.ConfigureMcpTool("get_snippets")
.WithProperty("snippetname", "string", "The name of the snippet.", required: true);
builder.Build().Run();
```


Tip

The example above used literal strings for things like the name of the "get_snippets" tool in both `Program.cs`

and the function. Consider instead using shared constant strings to keep things in sync across your project.

For the complete code example, see [SnippetTool.cs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet/blob/main/src/SnippetsTool.cs).

This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `SaveSnippets`

that tries to persist a named code snippet to blob storage.

```
@FunctionName("SaveSnippets")
@StorageAccount("AzureWebJobsStorage")
public String saveSnippet(
@McpToolTrigger(
name = "saveSnippets",
description = "Saves a text snippet to your snippets collection."
)
String mcpToolInvocationContext,
@McpToolProperty(
name = "snippetName",
propertyType = "string",
description = "The name of the snippet.",
required = true
)
String snippetName,
@McpToolProperty(
name = "snippet",
propertyType = "string",
description = "The content of the snippet.",
required = true
)
String snippet,
@BlobOutput(name = "outputBlob", path = "snippets/{mcptoolargs.snippetName}.json")
OutputBinding<String> outputBlob,
final ExecutionContext context
) {
// Log the entire incoming JSON for debugging
context.getLogger().info(mcpToolInvocationContext);
// Log the snippet name and content
context.getLogger().info("Saving snippet with name: " + snippetName);
context.getLogger().info("Snippet content:\n" + snippet);
// Write the snippet content to the output blob
outputBlob.setValue(snippet);
return "Successfully saved snippet '" + snippetName + "' with " + snippet.length() + " characters.";
}
```


This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `GetSnippets`

that tries to retrieve a code snippet by name from blob storage.

```
@FunctionName("GetSnippets")
@StorageAccount("AzureWebJobsStorage")
public String getSnippet(
@McpToolTrigger(
name = "getSnippets",
description = "Gets a text snippet from your snippets collection."
)
String mcpToolInvocationContext,
@McpToolProperty(
name = "snippetName",
propertyType = "string",
description = "The name of the snippet.",
required = true
)
String snippetName,
@BlobInput(name = "inputBlob", path = "snippets/{mcptoolargs.snippetName}.json")
String inputBlob,
final ExecutionContext context
) {
// Log the entire incoming JSON for debugging
context.getLogger().info(mcpToolInvocationContext);
// Log the snippet name and the fetched snippet content from the blob
context.getLogger().info("Retrieving snippet with name: " + snippetName);
context.getLogger().info("Snippet content:");
context.getLogger().info(inputBlob);
// Return the snippet content or a not found message
if (inputBlob != null && !inputBlob.trim().isEmpty()) {
return inputBlob;
} else {
return "Snippet '" + snippetName + "' not found.";
}
}
```


For the complete code example, see [Snippets.java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-java/blob/main/src/main/java/com/function/Snippets.java).

Example code for JavaScript isn't currently available. See the TypeScript examples for general guidance using Node.js.

This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `savesnippet`

that tries to persist a named code snippet to blob storage.

```
import { app, InvocationContext, input, output, arg } from "@azure/functions";
app.mcpTool("saveSnippet", {
toolName: SAVE_SNIPPET_TOOL_NAME,
description: SAVE_SNIPPET_TOOL_DESCRIPTION,
toolProperties: {
[SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_NAME]: arg.string().describe(SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION),
[SNIPPET_PROPERTY_NAME]: arg.string().describe(SNIPPET_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION)
},
extraOutputs: [blobOutputBinding],
handler: saveSnippet,
});
```


This code handles the `savesnippet`

trigger:

```
export async function saveSnippet(
_toolArguments: unknown,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<string> {
console.info("Saving snippet");
// Get snippet name and content from the tool arguments
const mcptoolargs = context.triggerMetadata.mcptoolargs as {
snippetname?: string;
snippet?: string;
};
const snippetName = mcptoolargs?.snippetname;
const snippet = mcptoolargs?.snippet;
if (!snippetName) {
return "No snippet name provided";
}
if (!snippet) {
return "No snippet content provided";
}
// Save the snippet to blob storage using the output binding
context.extraOutputs.set(blobOutputBinding, snippet);
console.info(`Saved snippet: ${snippetName}`);
return snippet;
}
```


This code creates an endpoint to expose a tool named `getsnippet`

that tries to retrieve a code snippet by name from blob storage.

```
import { app, InvocationContext, input, output, arg } from "@azure/functions";
app.mcpTool("getSnippet", {
toolName: GET_SNIPPET_TOOL_NAME,
description: GET_SNIPPET_TOOL_DESCRIPTION,
toolProperties: {
[SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_NAME]: arg.string().describe(SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION)
},
extraInputs: [blobInputBinding],
handler: getSnippet,
});
```


This code handles the `getsnippet`

trigger:

```
export async function getSnippet(
_toolArguments: unknown,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<string> {
console.info("Getting snippet");
// Get snippet name from the tool arguments
const mcptoolargs = context.triggerMetadata.mcptoolargs as {
snippetname?: string;
};
const snippetName = mcptoolargs?.snippetname;
console.info(`Snippet name: ${snippetName}`);
if (!snippetName) {
return "No snippet name provided";
}
// Get the content from blob binding - properly retrieving from extraInputs
const snippetContent = context.extraInputs.get(blobInputBinding);
if (!snippetContent) {
return `Snippet '${snippetName}' not found`;
}
console.info(`Retrieved snippet: ${snippetName}`);
return snippetContent as string;
}
```


For the complete code example, see [snippetsMcpTool.ts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript/blob/main/src/functions/snippetsMcpTool.ts).

This code uses the `mcp_tool_trigger`

decorator to create an endpoint to expose a tool named `save_snippet`

that tries to persist a named code snippet to blob storage.

```
@app.mcp_tool_trigger(
arg_name="context",
tool_name="save_snippet",
description="Save a snippet with a name.",
tool_properties=tool_properties_save_snippets_json,
)
@app.blob_output(arg_name="file", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage", path=_BLOB_PATH)
def save_snippet(file: func.Out[str], context) -> str:
content = json.loads(context)
snippet_name_from_args = content["arguments"][_SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_NAME]
snippet_content_from_args = content["arguments"][_SNIPPET_PROPERTY_NAME]
if not snippet_name_from_args:
return "No snippet name provided"
if not snippet_content_from_args:
return "No snippet content provided"
file.set(snippet_content_from_args)
logging.info(f"Saved snippet: {snippet_content_from_args}")
return f"Snippet '{snippet_content_from_args}' saved successfully"
```


This code uses the `mcp_tool_trigger`

decorator to create an endpoint to expose a tool named `get_snippet`

that tries to retrieve a code snippet by name from blob storage.

```
@app.mcp_tool_trigger(
arg_name="context",
tool_name="get_snippet",
description="Retrieve a snippet by name.",
tool_properties=tool_properties_get_snippets_json,
)
@app.blob_input(arg_name="file", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage", path=_BLOB_PATH)
def get_snippet(file: func.InputStream, context) -> str:
"""
Retrieves a snippet by name from Azure Blob Storage.
Args:
file (func.InputStream): The input binding to read the snippet from Azure Blob Storage.
context: The trigger context containing the input arguments.
Returns:
str: The content of the snippet or an error message.
"""
snippet_content = file.read().decode("utf-8")
logging.info(f"Retrieved snippet: {snippet_content}")
return snippet_content
```

Important

The MCP extension doesn't currently support PowerShell apps.

## Attributes

C# libraries use `McpToolTriggerAttribute`

to define the function trigger.

The attribute's constructor takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
ToolName |
(Required) name of the tool that's being exposed by the MCP trigger endpoint. |
Description |
(Optional) friendly description of the tool endpoint for clients. |

See [Usage](#usage) to learn how to define properties of the endpoint as input parameters.

## Annotations

The `@McpToolTrigger`

annotation creates a function that exposes a tool endpoint in your remote MCP server.

The annotation supports the following configuration options:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
name |
(Required) name of the tool that's being exposed by the MCP trigger endpoint. |
description |
(Optional) friendly description of the tool endpoint for clients. |

The `@McpToolProperty`

annotation defines individual properties for your tools. Each property parameter in your function should be annotated with this annotation.

The `@McpToolProperty`

annotation supports the following configuration options:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
name |
(Required) name of the tool property that gets exposed to clients. |
propertyType |
(Required) type of the tool property. Valid types are: `string` , `number` , `integer` , `boolean` , `object` . |
description |
(Optional) description of what the tool property does. |
required |
(Optional) if set to `true` , the tool property is required as an argument for tool calls. Defaults to `false` . |

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

The `mcp_tool_trigger`

decorator requires version 1.24.0 or later of the [ azure-functions package](https://pypi.org/project/azure-functions/). The following MCP trigger properties are supported on

`mcp_tool_trigger`

:| Property | Description |
|---|---|
arg_name |
The variable name (usually `context` ) used in function code to access the execution context. |
tool_name |
(Required) The name of the MCP server tool exposed by the function endpoint. |
description |
A description of the MCP server tool exposed by the function endpoint. |
tool_properties |
The JSON string representation of one or more property objects that expose properties of the tool to clients. |

## Configuration

The trigger supports these binding options, which are defined in your code:

| Options | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `mcpToolTrigger` . Only used with generic definitions. |
toolName |
(Required) The name of the MCP server tool exposed by the function endpoint. |
description |
A description of the MCP server tool exposed by the function endpoint. |
toolProperties |
An array of `toolProperty` objects that expose properties of the tool to clients. |
extraOutputs |
When defined, sends function output to another binding. |
handler |
The method that contains the actual function code. |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The MCP tool trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|

[define tool properties](#tool-properties).When binding to a JSON serializable type, you can optionally also include a parameter of type

[ToolInvocationContext](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mcp-extension/blob/main/src/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Mcp/Abstractions/ToolInvocationContext.cs)to access the tool call information.### Tool properties

MCP clients invoke tools with arguments to provide data and context for the tool's operation. The clients know how to collect and pass these arguments based on properties that the tool advertises as part of the protocol. You therefore need to define properties of the tool in your function code.

When you define a tool property, it's optional by default, and the client can omit it when invoking the tool. You need to explicitly mark properties as required if the tool can't operate without them.

Note

Earlier versions of the MCP extension preview made all tool properties required by default. This behavior changed as of version `1.0.0-preview.7`

, and now you must explicitly mark properties as required.

In C#, you can define properties for your tools in several ways. Which approach you use is a matter of code style preference. The options are:

- Your function takes input parameters using the
`McpToolProperty`

attribute. - You define a custom type with the properties, and the function binds to that type.
- You use the
`FunctionsApplicationBuilder`

to define properties in your`Program.cs`

file.

You can define one or more tool properties by applying the `McpToolProperty`

attribute to input binding-style parameters in your function.

The `McpToolPropertyAttribute`

type supports these properties:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
PropertyName |
Name of the tool property that gets exposed to clients. |
Description |
Description of what the tool property does. |
IsRequired |
(Optional) If set to `true` , the tool property is required as an argument for tool calls. Defaults to `false` . |

The property type is inferred from the type of the parameter to which you apply the attribute. For example `[McpToolProperty("snippetname", "The name of the snippet.", true)] string name`

defines a required tool property named `snippetname`

of type `string`

in MCP messages.

You can see these attributes used in the `SaveSnippet`

tool in the [Examples](#example).

In Java, you define tool properties by using the `@McpToolProperty`

annotation on individual function parameters. Each parameter that represents a tool property should be annotated with this annotation, specifying the property name, type, description, and whether it's required.

You can see these annotations used in the [Examples](#example).

You can configure tool properties in the trigger definition's `toolProperties`

field, which is a string representation of an array of `ToolProperty`

objects.

A `ToolProperty`

object has this structure:

```
{
"propertyName": "Name of the property",
"propertyType": "Type of the property",
"description": "Optional property description",
"isRequired": true|false,
"isArray": true|false
}
```


The fields of a `ToolProperty`

object are:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
propertyName |
Name of the tool property that gets exposed to clients. |
propertyType |
Type of the tool property. Valid types are: `string` , `number` , `integer` , `boolean` , `object` . See `isArray` for array types. |
description |
Description of what the tool property does. |
isRequired |
(Optional) If set to `true` , the tool property is required as an argument for tool calls. Defaults to `false` . |
isArray |
(Optional) If set to `true` , the tool property is an array of the specified property type. Defaults to `false` . |

You can provide the `toolProperties`

field as an array of `ToolProperty`

objects, or you can use the `arg`

helpers from `@azure/functions`

to define properties in a more type-safe way:

```
toolProperties: {
[SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_NAME]: arg.string().describe(SNIPPET_NAME_PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION)
}
```


For more information, see [Examples](#example).
