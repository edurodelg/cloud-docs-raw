# Tutorial: Apply machine learning models in Azure Functions with Python and TensorFlow

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to use Python, TensorFlow, and Azure Functions with a machine learning model to classify an image based on its contents. Because you do all work locally and create no Azure resources in the cloud, there is no cost to complete this tutorial.

- Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python.
- Import a custom TensorFlow machine learning model into a function app.
- Build a serverless HTTP API for classifying an image as containing a dog or a cat.
- Consume the API from a web app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). (Python 3.7.4 and Python 3.6.x are verified with Azure Functions; Python 3.8 and later versions are not yet supported.)- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) - A code editor such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Prerequisite check

- In a terminal or command window, run
`func --version`

to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 2.7.1846 or later. - Run
`python --version`

(Linux/macOS) or`py --version`

(Windows) to check your Python version reports 3.7.x.

## Clone the tutorial repository

In a terminal or command window, clone the following repository using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial.git`

Navigate into the folder and examine its contents.

`cd functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial`

*start*is your working folder for the tutorial.*end*is the final result and full implementation for your reference.*resources*contains the machine learning model and helper libraries.*frontend*is a website that calls the function app.


## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Navigate to the *start* folder and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Be sure to use Python 3.7, which is supported by Azure Functions.

```
cd start
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

.)

## Create a local functions project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single boilerplate function named `classify`

that provides an HTTP endpoint. You add more specific code in a later section.

In the

*start*folder, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to initialize a Python function app:`func init --worker-runtime python`

After initialization, the

*start*folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)and[host.json](functions-host-json). Because*local.settings.json*can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the*.gitignore*file.Tip

Because a function project is tied to a specific runtime, all the functions in the project must be written with the same language.

Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the

`--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the`--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger.`func new`

create a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named*function.json*.`func new --name classify --template "HTTP trigger"`

This command creates a folder matching the name of the function,

*classify*. In that folder are two files:*__init__.py*, which contains the function code, and*function.json*, which describes the function's trigger and its input and output bindings. For details on the contents of these files, see[Programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration#programming-model)in the Python developer guide.

## Run the function locally

Start the function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host in the

*start*folder:`func start`

Once you see the

`classify`

endpoint appear in the output, navigate to the URL,`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?name=Azure`

. The message "Hello Azure!" should appear in the output.Use

**Ctrl**-**C**to stop the host.

## Import the TensorFlow model and add helper code

To modify the `classify`

function to classify an image based on its contents, you use a pre-built TensorFlow model that was trained with and exported from Azure Custom Vision Service. The model, which is contained in the *resources* folder of the sample you cloned earlier, classifies an image based on whether it contains a dog or a cat. You then add some helper code and dependencies to your project.

To build your own model using the free tier of the Custom Vision Service, follow the instructions in the [sample project repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/blob/master/train-custom-vision-model.md).

Tip

If you want to host your TensorFlow model independent of the function app, you can instead mount a file share containing your model to your Linux function app. To learn more, see [Mount a file share to a Python function app using Azure CLI](scripts/functions-cli-mount-files-storage-linux).

In the

*start*folder, run following command to copy the model files into the*classify*folder. Be sure to include`\*`

in the command.`cp ../resources/model/* classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder contains files named*model.pb*and*labels.txt*. If not, check that you ran the command in the*start*folder.In the

*start*folder, run the following command to copy a file with helper code into the*classify*folder:`cp ../resources/predict.py classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder now contains a file named*predict.py*.Open

*start/requirements.txt*in a text editor and add the following dependencies required by the helper code:`tensorflow==1.14 Pillow requests`

Save

*requirements.txt*.Install the dependencies by running the following command in the

*start*folder. Installation may take a few minutes, during which time you can proceed with modifying the function in the next section.`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`

On Windows, you may encounter the error, "Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:" followed by a long pathname to a file like

*sharded_mutable_dense_hashtable.cpython-37.pyc*. Typically, this error happens because the depth of the folder path becomes too long. In this case, set the registry key`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem@LongPathsEnabled`

to`1`

to enable long paths. Alternately, check where your Python interpreter is installed. If that location has a long path, try reinstalling in a folder with a shorter path.

Tip

When calling upon *predict.py* to make its first prediction, a function named `_initialize`

loads the TensorFlow model from disk and caches it in global variables. This caching speeds up subsequent predictions.

## Update the function to run predictions

Open

*classify/__init__.py*in a text editor and add the following lines after the existing`import`

statements to import the standard JSON library and the*predict*helpers:`import logging import azure.functions as func import json # Import helper script from .predict import predict_image_from_url`

Replace the entire contents of the

`main`

function with the following code:`def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse: image_url = req.params.get('img') logging.info('Image URL received: ' + image_url) results = predict_image_from_url(image_url) headers = { "Content-type": "application/json", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" } return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(results), headers = headers)`

This function receives an image URL in a query string parameter named

`img`

. It then calls`predict_image_from_url`

from the helper library to download and classify the image using the TensorFlow model. The function then returns an HTTP response with the results.Important

Because this HTTP endpoint is called by a web page hosted on another domain, the response includes an

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header to satisfy the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.In a production application, change

`*`

to the web page's specific origin for added security.Save your changes, then assuming that dependencies have finished installing, start the local function host again with

`func start`

. Be sure to run the host in the*start*folder with the virtual environment activated. Otherwise the host will start, but you will see errors when invoking the function.`func start`

In a browser, open the following URL to invoke the function with the URL of a cat image and confirm that the returned JSON classifies the image as a cat.

`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?img=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat1.png`

Keep the host running because you use it in the next step.


### Run the local web app front end to test the function

To test invoking the function endpoint from another web app, there's a simple app in the repository's *frontend* folder.

Open a new terminal or command prompt and activate the virtual environment (as described earlier under

[Create and activate a Python virtual environment](#create-and-activate-a-python-virtual-environment)).Navigate to the repository's

*frontend*folder.Start an HTTP server with Python:

`python -m http.server`

In a browser, navigate to

`localhost:8000`

, then enter one of the following photo URLs into the textbox, or use the URL of any publicly accessible image.`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat1.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat2.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/dog1.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/dog2.png`


Select

**Submit**to invoke the function endpoint to classify the image.If the browser reports an error when you submit the image URL, check the terminal in which you're running the function app. If you see an error like "No module found 'PIL'", you may have started the function app in the

*start*folder without first activating the virtual environment you created earlier. If you still see errors, run`pip install -r requirements.txt`

again with the virtual environment activated and look for errors.

Note

The model always classifies the content of the image as a cat or a dog, regardless of whether the image contains either, defaulting to dog. Images of tigers and panthers, for example, typically classify as cat, but images of elephants, carrots, or airplanes classify as dog.

## Clean up resources

Because the entirety of this tutorial runs locally on your machine, there are no Azure resources or services to clean up.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to build and customize an HTTP API endpoint with Azure Functions to classify images using a TensorFlow model. You also learned how to call the API from a web app. You can use the techniques in this tutorial to build out APIs of any complexity, all while running on the serverless compute model provided by Azure Functions.

# Dapr Topic trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can be triggered on a Dapr topic subscription using the following Dapr events.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("TransferEventBetweenTopics")]
public static void Run(
[DaprTopicTrigger("%PubSubName%", Topic = "A")] CloudEvent subEvent,
[DaprPublish(PubSubName = "%PubSubName%", Topic = "B")] out DaprPubSubEvent pubEvent,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
pubEvent = new DaprPubSubEvent("Transfer from Topic A: " + subEvent.Data);
}
```


Here's the Java code for subscribing to a topic using the Dapr Topic trigger:

```
@FunctionName("PrintTopicMessage")
public String run(
@DaprTopicTrigger(
pubSubName = "%PubSubName%",
topic = "B")
String payload,
final ExecutionContext context) throws JsonProcessingException {
Logger logger = context.getLogger();
logger.info("Java function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.");
```


Use the `app`

object to register the `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('TransferEventBetweenTopics', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'daprTopicTrigger',
name: "subEvent",
pubsubname: "%PubSubName%",
topic: "A"
}),
return: daprPublishOutput,
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
context.log(context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data);
return { payload: context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data };
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "daprTopicTrigger",
"pubsubname": "%PubSubName%",
"topic": "B",
"name": "subEvent",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$subEvent
)
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $subEvent["data"] | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
Write-Host "Topic B received a message: $jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr Topic trigger, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="PrintTopicMessage")
@app.dapr_topic_trigger(arg_name="subEvent", pub_sub_name="%PubSubName%", topic="B", route="B")
def main(subEvent) -> None:
logging.info('Python function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.')
subEvent_json = json.loads(subEvent)
logging.info("Topic B received a message: " + subEvent_json["data"])
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprTopicTrigger`

to trigger a Dapr pub/sub binding, which supports the following properties.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
PubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
Topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Annotations

The `DaprTopicTrigger`

annotation allows you to create a function that runs when a topic is received.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
pubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties for `@dapp.dapr_topic_trigger`

that you set in your Python code.

| Property | Description | Can be sent via Attribute | Can be sent via RequestBody |
|---|---|---|---|
pub_sub_name |
The name of the Dapr subscription component type. | ✔️ | ❌ |
topic |
The subscription topic. | ✔️ | ❌ |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

To use a Dapr Topic trigger, start by setting up a Dapr pub/sub component. You can learn more about which component to use and how to set it up in the official Dapr documentation.

To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in Python v2, set up your project with the correct dependencies.

In your

`requirements.text`

file, add the following line:`azure-functions==1.18.0b3`

In the terminal, install the Python library.

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Modify your

`local.setting.json`

file with the following configuration:`"PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES":1`

# Azure Web PubSub output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the *Web PubSub* output binding to invoke Azure Web PubSub service to do something. You can send a message to:

- All connected clients
- Connected clients authenticated to a specific user
- Connected clients joined in a specific group
- A specific client connection

The output binding also allows you to manage clients and groups, and grant/revoke permissions targeting specific connectionId with group.

- Add connection to group
- Add user to group
- Remove connection from a group
- Remove user from a group
- Remove user from all groups
- Close all client connections
- Close a specific client connection
- Close connections in a group
- Grant permission of a connection
- Revoke permission of a connection

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-web-pubsub).

## Example

```
[Function("WebPubSubOutputBinding")]
[WebPubSubOutput(Hub = "<hub>", Connection = "<web_pubsub_connection_name>")]
public static WebPubSubAction Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
return new SendToAllAction
{
Data = BinaryData.FromString("Hello Web PubSub!"),
DataType = WebPubSubDataType.Text
};
}
```


```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const wpsMsg = output.generic({
type: 'webPubSub',
name: 'actions',
hub: '<hub>',
});
app.http('message', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [wpsMsg],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.extraOutputs.set(wpsMsg, [{
"actionName": "sendToAll",
"data": `Hello world`,
"dataType": `text`
}]);
}
});
```


Note

Complete samples for this language are pending

Note

The Web PubSub extensions for Java is not supported yet.

### WebPubSubAction

`WebPubSubAction`

is the base abstract type of output bindings. The derived types represent the action server want service to invoke.

In C# language, we provide a few static methods under `WebPubSubAction`

to help discover available actions. For example, user can create the `SendToAllAction`

by call `WebPubSubAction.CreateSendToAllAction()`

.

| Derived Class | Properties |
|---|---|
`SendToAllAction` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToGroupAction` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToUserAction` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`SendToConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`AddUserToGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromAllGroupsAction` |
UserId |
`AddConnectionToGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`RemoveConnectionFromGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`CloseAllConnectionsAction` |
Excluded, Reason |
`CloseClientConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`CloseGroupConnectionsAction` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`GrantPermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`RevokePermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

** actionName** is the key parameter to resolve the type. Available actions are listed as follows.

| ActionName | Properties |
|---|---|
`sendToAll` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToGroup` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToUser` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`sendToConnection` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`addUserToGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromAllGroups` |
UserId |
`addConnectionToGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`removeConnectionFromGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`closeAllConnections` |
Excluded, Reason |
`closeClientConnection` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`closeGroupConnections` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`grantPermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`revokePermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

Important

The message data property in the sent message related actions must be `string`

if data type is set to `json`

or `text`

to avoid data conversion ambiguity. Please use `JSON.stringify()`

to convert the json object in need. This is applied to any place using message property, for example, `UserEventResponse.Data`

working with `WebPubSubTrigger`

.

When data type is set to `binary`

, it's allowed to leverage binding naturally supported `dataType`

as `binary`

configured in the `function.json`

, see [Trigger and binding definitions](functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=csharp#trigger-and-binding-definitions) for details.

### Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file and the `WebPubSub`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `webPubSub` |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `out` |
name |
n/a | Variable name used in function code for output binding object. |
hub |
Hub | The value must be set to the name of the Web PubSub hub for the function to be triggered. We support set the value in attribute as higher priority, or it can be set in app settings as a global value. |
connection |
Connection | The name of the app setting that contains the Web PubSub Service connection string (defaults to "WebPubSubConnectionString"). |

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Web PubSub service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize a managed identity request by using Microsoft Entra ID](../azure-web-pubsub/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity).

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging

You can also easily [enable console logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) if you want to dig deeper into the requests you're making against the service.

# Connect functions to Azure services using bindings

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create a function, language-specific trigger code is added in your project from a set of trigger templates. If you want to connect your function to other services by using input or output bindings, you have to add specific binding definitions in your function. To learn more about bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

## Local development

When you develop functions locally, you need to update the function code to add bindings. For languages that use function.json, [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) provides tooling to add bindings to a function.

### Manually add bindings based on examples

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to add binding-specific attributes to the function definition in code.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to add binding-specific annotations to the function definition in code.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to update the function code and add a definition to the function.json configuration file.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need update the function definition, depending on your model:

The following example shows the function definition after adding a [Queue Storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output) to an [HTTP triggered function](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger):

Because an HTTP triggered function also returns an HTTP response, the function returns a `MultiResponse`

object, which represents both the HTTP and queue output.

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
```


This example is the definition of the `MultiResponse`

object that includes the output binding:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public IActionResult HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


When applying that example to your own project, you might need to change `HttpRequest`

to `HttpRequestData`

and `IActionResult`

to `HttpResponseData`

, depending on if you are using [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) or not.

Messages are sent to the queue when the function completes. The way you define the output binding depends on your process model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@FunctionName("HttpExample")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=java#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=javascript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=powershell#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@app.route(route="HttpExample")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
def HttpExample(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out [func.QueueMessage]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Python model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=python#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=typescript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

Use the following table to find examples of specific binding types that you can use to guide you in updating an existing function. First, choose the language tab that corresponds to your project.

Binding code for C# depends on the [specific process model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#benefits-of-the-isolated-worker-model).

When you use Visual Studio Code to develop your function and your function uses a function.json file, the Azure Functions extension can automatically add a binding to an existing function.json file. To learn more, see [Add input and output bindings](functions-develop-vs-code#add-input-and-output-bindings).

## Azure portal

When you develop your functions in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you add input and output bindings in the **Integrate** tab for a given function. The new bindings are added to either the function.json file or to the method attributes, depending on your language. The following articles show examples of how to add bindings to an existing function in the portal:

# Deploy serverless Java apps with Quarkus on Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you'll develop, build, and deploy a serverless Java app to Azure Functions by using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io). This article uses Quarkus Funqy and its built-in support for the Azure Functions HTTP trigger for Java. Using Quarkus with Azure Functions gives you the power of the Quarkus programming model with the scale and flexibility of Azure Functions. When you finish, you'll run serverless Quarkus applications on Azure Functions and continue to monitor your app on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- The
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/overview)installed on your own computer. - An
[Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/). If you don't have an Azure account, create a[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. [Java JDK 17](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)with`JAVA_HOME`

configured appropriately. This article was written with Java 17 in mind, but Azure Functions and Quarkus also support older versions of Java.[Apache Maven 3.8.1+](https://maven.apache.org).

## Create the app project

Use the following command to clone the sample Java project for this article. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quarkus-azure).

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quarkus-azure
cd quarkus-azure
git checkout 2023-01-10
cd functions-quarkus
```


If you see a message about being in **detached HEAD** state, this message is safe to ignore. Because this article does not require any commits, detached HEAD state is appropriate.

Explore the sample function. Open the *functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/GreetingFunction.java* file.

Run the following command. The `@Funq`

annotation makes your method (in this case, `funqyHello`

) a serverless function.

```
@Funq
public String funqyHello() {
return "hello funqy";
}
```


Azure Functions Java has its own set of Azure-specific annotations, but these annotations aren't necessary when you're using Quarkus on Azure Functions in a simple capacity as we're doing here. For more information about Azure Functions Java annotations, see the [Azure Functions Java developer guide](functions-reference-java).

Unless you specify otherwise, the function's name is the same as the method name. You can also use the following command to define the function name with a parameter to the annotation:

```
@Funq("alternateName")
public String funqyHello() {
return "hello funqy";
}
```


The name is important. It becomes a part of the REST URI to invoke the function, as shown later in the article.

## Test the function locally

Use `mvn`

to run Quarkus dev mode on your local terminal. Running Quarkus in this way enables live reload with background compilation. When you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect.

A browser refresh triggers a scan of the workspace. If the scan detects any changes, the Java files are recompiled and the application is redeployed. Your redeployed application services the request. If there are any problems with compilation or deployment, an error page will let you know.

In the following procedure, replace `yourResourceGroupName`

with a resource group name. Function app names must be globally unique across all of Azure. Resource group names must be globally unique within a subscription. This article achieves the necessary uniqueness by prepending the resource group name to the function name. Consider prepending a unique identifier to any names you create that must be unique. A useful technique is to use your initials followed by today's date in `mmdd`

format.

The resource group is not necessary for this part of the instructions, but it's required later. For simplicity, the Maven project requires you to define the property.

Invoke Quarkus dev mode:

`mvn -DskipTests -DresourceGroup=<yourResourceGroupName> quarkus:dev`

The output should look like this:

`... --/ __ \/ / / / _ | / _ \/ //_/ / / / __/ -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ ,< / /_/ /\ \ --\___\_\____/_/ |_/_/|_/_/|_|\____/___/ INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) quarkus-azure-function 1.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus xx.xx.xx.) started in 1.290s. Listening on: http://localhost:8080 INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated. INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Installed features: [cdi, funqy-http, smallrye-context-propagation, vertx] -- Tests paused Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>`

Access the function by using the

`CURL`

command on your local terminal:`curl localhost:8080/api/funqyHello`

The output should look like this:

`"hello funqy"`


## Add dependency injection to the function

The open-standard technology Jakarta EE Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) provides dependency injection in Quarkus.

Add a new function that uses dependency injection.

Create a

*GreetingService.java*file in the*functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus*directory. Use the following code as the source code of the file:`package io.quarkus; import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped; @ApplicationScoped public class GreetingService { public String greeting(String name) { return "Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, " + name; } }`

Save the file.

`GreetingService`

is an injectable bean that implements a`greeting()`

method. The method returns a`Welcome...`

string message with a`name`

parameter.Open the existing

*functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/GreetingFunction.java*file. Replace the class with the following code to add a new`gService`

field and the`greeting`

method:`package io.quarkus; import javax.inject.Inject; import io.quarkus.funqy.Funq; public class GreetingFunction { @Inject GreetingService gService; @Funq public String greeting(String name) { return gService.greeting(name); } @Funq public String funqyHello() { return "hello funqy"; } }`

Save the file.

Access the new

`greeting`

function by using the`curl`

command on your local terminal:`curl -d '"Dan"' -X POST localhost:8080/api/greeting`

The output should look like this:

`"Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, Dan"`

Important

Live Coding (also called dev mode) allows you to run the app and make changes on the fly. Quarkus will automatically recompile and reload the app when changes are made. This is a powerful and efficient style of developing that you'll use throughout this article.

Before you move forward to the next step, stop Quarkus dev mode by selecting Ctrl+C.


## Deploy the app to Azure

If you haven't already, sign in to your Azure subscription by using the following

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index)command and follow the on-screen directions:`az login`

Note

If multiple Azure tenants are associated with your Azure credentials, you must specify which tenant you want to sign in to. You can do this by using the

`--tenant`

option. For example:`az login --tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com`

.Continue the process in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with

`az login --use-device-code`

.After you sign in successfully, the output on your local terminal should look similar to the following:

`xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxx 'Microsoft' [ { "cloudName": "AzureCloud", "homeTenantId": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx", "id": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx", "isDefault": true, "managedByTenants": [], "name": "Contoso account services", "state": "Enabled", "tenantId": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx", "user": { "name": "user@contoso.com", "type": "user" } } ]`

Build and deploy the functions to Azure.

The

*pom.xml*file that you generated in the previous step uses`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

. Running`mvn install`

generates configuration files and a staging directory that`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

requires. For`yourResourceGroupName`

, use the value that you used previously.`mvn clean install -DskipTests -DtenantId=<your tenantId from shown previously> -DresourceGroup=<yourResourceGroupName> azure-functions:deploy`

During deployment, sign in to Azure. The

`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

plug-in is configured to prompt for Azure sign-in each time the project is deployed. During the build, output similar to the following appears:`[INFO] Auth type: DEVICE_CODE To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code AXCWTLGMP to authenticate.`

Do as the output says and authenticate to Azure by using the browser and the provided device code. Many other authentication and configuration options are available. The complete reference documentation for

`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

is available at[Azure Functions: Configuration Details](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Functions:-Configuration-Details).After authentication, the build should continue and finish. Make sure that output includes

`BUILD SUCCESS`

near the end.`Successfully deployed the artifact to https://quarkus-demo-123451234.azurewebsites.net`

You can also find the URL to trigger your function on Azure in the output log:

`[INFO] HTTP Trigger Urls: [INFO] quarkus : https://quarkus-azure-functions-http-archetype-20220629204040017.azurewebsites.net/api/{*path}`

It will take a while for the deployment to finish. In the meantime, let's explore Azure Functions in the Azure portal.


## Access and monitor the serverless function on Azure

Sign in to [the portal](https://aka.ms/publicportal) and ensure that you've selected the same tenant and subscription that you used in the Azure CLI.

Type

**function app**on the search bar at the top of the Azure portal and select the Enter key. Your function app should be deployed and show up with the name`<yourResourceGroupName>-function-quarkus`

.Select the function app to show detailed information, such as

**Location**,**Subscription**,**URL**,**Metrics**, and**App Service Plan**. Then, select the**URL**value.Confirm that the welcome page says your function app is "up and running."

Invoke the

`greeting`

function by using the following`curl`

command on your local terminal.Important

Replace

`YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL`

with your own function URL that you find in the Azure portal or output.`curl -d '"Dan on Azure"' -X POST https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/greeting`

The output should look similar to the following:

`"Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, Dan on Azure"`

You can also access the other function (

`funqyHello`

) by using the following`curl`

command:`curl https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/funqyHello`

The output should be the same as what you observed earlier:

`"hello funqy"`

If you want to exercise the basic metrics capability in the Azure portal, try invoking the function within a shell

`for`

loop:`for i in {1..100}; do curl -d '"Dan on Azure"' -X POST https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/greeting; done`

After a while, you'll see some metrics data in the portal.


Now that you've opened your Azure function in the portal, here are more features that you can access from the portal:

- Monitor the performance of your Azure function. For more information, see
[Monitoring Azure Functions](monitor-functions). - Explore telemetry. For more information, see
[Analyze Azure Functions telemetry in Application Insights](analyze-telemetry-data). - Set up logging. For more information, see
[Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions](streaming-logs).

## Clean up resources

If you don't need these resources, you can delete them by running the following command:

```
az group delete --name <yourResourceGroupName> --yes
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to:

- Run Quarkus dev mode.
- Deploy a Funqy app to Azure functions by using
`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

. - Examine the performance of the function in the portal.

# Quickstart: Respond to database changes in Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this Quickstart, you use Visual Studio Code to build an app that responds to database changes in a No SQL database in Azure Cosmos DB. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to a new serverless function app you create running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project source uses the Azure Developer CLI (azd) extension with Visual Studio Code to simplify initializing and verifying your project code locally, as well as and deploying your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

Important

While responding to [changes in an Azure Cosmos DB No SQL database](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger) is supported for all languages, this quickstart scenario currently only has examples for C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete this quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)for Visual Studio Code. This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local). When this tool isn't available locally, the extension tries to install it by using a package-based installer. You can also install or update the Core Tools package by running`Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools`

from the command palette. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead[manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

[C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)for Visual Studio Code.

- The
[Azure Developer CLI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-dev)for Visual Studio Code.

## Initialize the project

You can use the `azd init`

command from the command palette to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace in which you want to create your project.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Initialize App (init)`

, and then choose**Select a template**.There might be a slight delay while

`azd`

initializes the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Bindings (.NET)`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-dotnet`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions TypeScript CosmosDB trigger`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-ts`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions Python with CosmosDB triggers and bindings...`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-py`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

Run this command, depending on your local operating system, to grant configuration scripts the required permissions:

Run this command with sufficient privileges:

`chmod +x ./infra/scripts/*.sh`


Before you can run your app locally, you must create the resources in Azure. This project doesn't use local emulation for Azure Cosmos DB.

## Create Azure resources

This project is configured to use the `azd provision`

command to create a function app in a Flex Consumption plan, along with other required Azure resources that follows current best practices.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Sign In with Azure Developer CLI`

, and then sign in using your Azure account.Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Provision Azure resources (provision)`

to create the required Azure resources:When prompted in the Terminal window, provide these required deployment parameters:

Prompt Description Select an Azure Subscription to use Choose the subscription in which you want your resources to be created. *location*deployment parameterAzure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. *vnetEnabled*deployment parameterWhile the template supports creating resources inside a virtual network, to simplify deployment and testing, choose `False`

.The

`azd provision`

command uses your response to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to create and configure these required Azure resources, following the latest best practices:- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Cosmos DB account
- Azure Storage (required) and Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Service-to-service connections using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)

Post-provision hooks also generate the

*local.settings.json*file required when running locally. This file also contains the settings required to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB database in Azure.Tip

Should any steps fail during provisioning, you can rerun the

`azd provision`

command again after resolving any issues.After the command completes successfully, you can run your project code locally and trigger on the Azure Cosmos DB database in Azure.


## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to your new function app in Azure.

Press

`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`Azurite: Start`

.To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel, and you can see the name of the function that's running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, press`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`NoSQL: Create Item...`

and select both the`document-db`

database and the`documents`

container.Replace the contents of the

*New Item.json*file with this JSON data and select**Save**:`{ "id": "doc1", "title": "Sample document", "content": "This is a sample document for testing my Azure Cosmos DB trigger in Azure Functions." }`

After you select

**Save**, you see the execution of the function in the terminal and the local document is updated to include metadata added by the service.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

## Review the code (optional)

The function is triggered based on the change feed in an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL database. These environment variables configure how the trigger monitors the change feed:

`COSMOS_CONNECTION__accountEndpoint`

: The Cosmos DB account endpoint`COSMOS_DATABASE_NAME`

: The name of the database to monitor`COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME`

: The name of the container to monitor

These environment variables are created for you both in Azure (function app settings) and locally (local.settings.json) during the `azd provision`

operation.

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [CosmosTrigger.cs project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/CosmosTrigger.cs).

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [cosmos_trigger.ts project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/src/functions/cosmos_trigger.ts).

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [function_app.py project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/function_app.py).

After you review and verify your function code locally, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

You can run the `azd deploy`

command from Visual Studio Code to deploy the project code to your already provisioned resources in Azure.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Deploy to Azure (deploy)`

.The

`azd deploy`

command packages and deploys your code to the deployment container. The app is then started and runs in the deployed package.After the command completes successfully, your app is running in Azure.


## Invoke the function on Azure

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`Azure: Open in portal`

, select`Function app`

, and choose your new app. Sign in with your Azure account, if necessary.This command opens your new function app in the Azure portal.

In the

**Overview**tab on the main page, select your function app name and then the**Logs**tab.Use the

`NoSQL: Create Item`

command in Visual Studio Code to again add a document to the container as before.Verify again that the function gets triggered by an update in the monitored container.


## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd deploy`

command as many times as you need to deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that were used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

# SignalR Service input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Before a client can connect to Azure SignalR Service, it must retrieve the service endpoint URL and a valid access token. The *SignalRConnectionInfo* input binding produces the SignalR Service endpoint URL and a valid token that are used to connect to the service. The token is time-limited and can be used to authenticate a specific user to a connection. Therefore, you shouldn't cache the token or share it between clients. Usually you use *SignalRConnectionInfo* with HTTP trigger for clients to retrieve the connection information.

For more information on how to use this binding to create a "negotiate" function that is compatible with a SignalR client SDK, see [Azure Functions development and configuration with Azure SignalR Service](../azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config).

When not explicitly declared, assume that examples are using the default connection setting value of `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-signalr-service).

## Example

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that acquires SignalR connection information using the input binding and returns it over HTTP.

```
[Function(nameof(Negotiate))]
public static string Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)] HttpRequestData req,
[SignalRConnectionInfoInput(HubName = "serverless")] string connectionInfo)
{
// The serialization of the connection info object is done by the framework. It should be camel case. The SignalR client respects the camel case response only.
return connectionInfo;
}
```


The following example shows a SignalR connection info input binding in a *function.json* file and a function that uses the binding to return the connection information.

Here's binding data for the example in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
"name": "connectionInfo",
"hubName": "hubName1",
"connectionStringSetting": "<name of setting containing SignalR Service connection string>",
"direction": "in"
}
```


Here's the JavaScript code:

```
const { app, input } = require('@azure/functions');
const inputSignalR = input.generic({
type: 'signalRConnectionInfo',
name: 'connectionInfo',
hubName: 'hubName1',
connectionStringSetting: 'AzureSignalRConnectionString',
});
app.post('negotiate', {
authLevel: 'function',
handler: (request, context) => {
return { body: JSON.stringify(context.extraInputs.get(inputSignalR)) }
},
route: 'negotiate',
extraInputs: [inputSignalR],
});
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

The following example shows a SignalR connection info input binding in a *function.json* file and a [Python function](functions-reference-python) that uses the binding to return the connection information.

Here's the Python code:

```
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, connectionInfoJson: str) -> func.HttpResponse:
return func.HttpResponse(
connectionInfoJson,
status_code=200,
headers={
'Content-type': 'application/json'
}
)
```


The following example shows a [Java function](functions-reference-java) that acquires SignalR connection information using the input binding and returns it over HTTP.

```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(
name = "connectionInfo",
HubName = "hubName1") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file.

The following table explains the properties of the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

attribute:

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
HubName |
Required. The hub name. |
ConnectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting or settings collection that contains the SignalR Service connection string, which defaults to `AzureSignalRConnectionString` . |
UserId |
Optional. The user identifier of a SignalR connection. You can use a
|

**IdToken****ClaimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**ClaimTypeList****IdToken**.## Annotations

The following table explains the supported settings for the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

annotation.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|

userId |
Optional. The user identifier of a SignalR connection. You can use a
|

**idToken****claimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**claimTypeList****idToken**.## Annotations

The following table explains the supported settings for the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

annotation.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|

|

**idToken****claimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**claimTypeList****idToken**.Warning

For the simplicity, we omit the authentication and authorization parts in this sample. As a result, this endpoint is publicly accessible without any restrictions. To ensure the security of your negotiation endpoint, you should implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms based on your specific requirements. For guidance on protecting your HTTP endpoints, see the following articles:

## Usage

### Managed identity-based connections

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Azure SignalR service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure SignalR Service resources with Microsoft Entra managed identities](../azure-signalr/signalr-howto-authorize-managed-identity#azure-signalr-service-bindings-in-azure-functions).

### Authenticated tokens

When an authenticated client triggers the function, you can add a user ID claim to the generated token. You can easily add authentication to a function app using [App Service Authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).

App Service authentication sets HTTP headers named `x-ms-client-principal-id`

and `x-ms-client-principal-name`

that contain the authenticated user's client principal ID and name, respectively.

You can set the `UserId`

property of the binding to the value from either header using a [binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger): `{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}`

or `{headers.x-ms-client-principal-name}`

.

```
[Function("Negotiate")]
public static string Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)] HttpRequestData req,
[SignalRConnectionInfoInput(HubName = "hubName1", UserId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}")] string connectionInfo)
{
// The serialization of the connection info object is done by the framework. It should be camel case. The SignalR client respects the camel case response only.
return connectionInfo;
}
```


```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.GET },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(name = "connectionInfo", hubName = "hubName1", userId = "{headers.x-ms-signalr-userid}") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


Here's binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
"name": "connectionInfo",
"hubName": "hubName1",
"userId": "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}",
"connectionStringSetting": "<name of setting containing SignalR Service connection string>",
"direction": "in"
}
```


Here's the JavaScript code:

```
const { app, input } = require('@azure/functions');
const inputSignalR = input.generic({
type: 'signalRConnectionInfo',
name: 'connectionInfo',
hubName: 'hubName1',
connectionStringSetting: 'AzureSignalRConnectionString',
userId: '{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}',
});
app.post('negotiate', {
authLevel: 'function',
handler: (request, context) => {
return { body: JSON.stringify(context.extraInputs.get(inputSignalR)) }
},
route: 'negotiate',
extraInputs: [inputSignalR],
});
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

Here's the Python code:

```
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, connectionInfo: str) -> func.HttpResponse:
# connectionInfo contains an access key token with a name identifier
# claim set to the authenticated user
return func.HttpResponse(
connectionInfo,
status_code=200,
headers={
'Content-type': 'application/json'
}
)
```


```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(
name = "connectionInfo",
HubName = "hubName1",
userId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


### Binding expressions for HTTP trigger

[
It's a common scenario that the values of some attributes of SignalR input binding come from HTTP requests. Therefore, we show how to bind values from HTTP requests to SignalR input binding attributes via ][binding expression](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns#trigger-metadata).

| HTTP metadata type | Binding expression format | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP request query | `{query.QUERY_PARAMETER_NAME}` |
Binds the value of corresponding query parameter to an attribute | `{query.userName}` |
| HTTP request header | `{headers.HEADER_NAME}` |
Binds the value of a header to an attribute | `{headers.token}` |

# Quickstart: Create your first C# function in Azure using Visual Studio

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions lets you use Visual Studio to create local C# function projects and then easily publish this project to run in a scalable serverless environment in Azure. If you prefer to develop your C# apps locally using Visual Studio Code, you should instead consider the [Visual Studio Code-based version](how-to-create-function-vs-code?pivot=programming-language-csharp) of this article.

By default, this article shows you how to create C# functions that run on .NET 8 in an [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). Function apps that run in an isolated worker process are supported on all versions of .NET that are supported by Functions. For more information, see [Supported versions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#supported-versions).

In this article, you learn how to:

- Use Visual Studio to create a C# class library project.
- Create a function that responds to HTTP requests.
- Run your code locally to verify function behavior.
- Deploy your code project to Azure Functions.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

This video shows you how to create a C# function in Azure.

The steps in the video are also described in the following sections.

## Prerequisites

[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). Make sure to select the**Azure development**workload during installation.[Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't already have an account,[create a free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

## Create a function app project

The Azure Functions project template in Visual Studio creates a C# class library project that you can publish to a function app in Azure. You can use a function app to group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, scaling, and sharing of resources.

From the Visual Studio menu, select

**File**>**New**>**Project**.In

**Create a new project**, enter*functions*in the search box, choose the**Azure Functions**template, and then select**Next**.In

**Configure your new project**, enter a**Project name**for your project, and then select**Next**. The function app name must be valid as a C# namespace, so don't use underscores, hyphens, or any other nonalphanumeric characters.For the remaining

**Additional information**settings,Setting Value Description **Functions worker****.NET 8.0 Isolated (Long Term Support)**Your functions run on .NET 8 in an isolated worker process. **Function****HTTP trigger**This value creates a function triggered by an HTTP request. **Use Azurite for runtime storage account (AzureWebJobsStorage)**Enable Because a function app in Azure requires a storage account, one is assigned or created when you publish your project to Azure. An HTTP trigger doesn't use an Azure Storage account connection string; all other trigger types require a valid Azure Storage account connection string. When you select this option, the [Azurite emulator](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio)is used.**Authorization level****Anonymous**The created function can be triggered by any client without providing a key. This authorization setting makes it easy to test your new function. For more information, see [Authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth).Make sure you set the

**Authorization level**to**Anonymous**. If you choose the default level of**Function**, you're required to present the[function key](function-keys-how-to)in requests to access your function endpoint in Azure.Select

**Create**to create the function project and HTTP trigger function.

Visual Studio creates a project and class that contains boilerplate code for the HTTP trigger function type. The boilerplate code sends an HTTP response that includes a value from the request body or query string. The `HttpTrigger`

attribute specifies that the function is triggered by an HTTP request.

## Rename the function

The `Function`

method attribute sets the name of the function, which by default is generated as `Function1`

. Since the tooling doesn't let you override the default function name when you create your project, take a minute to create a better name for the function class, file, and metadata.

In

**File Explorer**, right-click the Function1.cs file and rename it to`HttpExample.cs`

.In the code, rename the Function1 class to

`HttpExample`

.In the method named

`Run`

, rename the`Function`

method attribute to`HttpExample`

.

Your function definition should now look like the following code:

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public IActionResult Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req)
{
_logger. LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult("Hello, functions");
}
```


Now that you've renamed the function, you can test it on your local computer.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can test your functions locally using the full Azure Functions runtime.

To run your function, press

`F5`in Visual Studio. You might need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests. Authorization levels are never enforced when you run a function locally.Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar and run the request. The following image shows the response in the browser to the local GET request returned by the function:

To stop debugging, press

`Shift`+`F5`in Visual Studio.

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Publish the project to Azure

Visual Studio can publish your local project to Azure. Before you can publish your project, you must have a function app in your Azure subscription. If you don't already have a function app in Azure, Visual Studio can help you create one before you publish your project. In this article, you create a function app that runs on Linux in a Flex Consumption plan, which is the recommended plan for event-driven and secure serverless functions.

In

**Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and then select**Publish**.On the

**Publish**page, make the following selections:- On
**Target**, select**Azure**, and then select**Next**. - On
**Specific target**, select**Azure Function App**, and then select**Next**. - On
**Functions instance**, select**Create new**.

- On
Create a new instance by using the values specified in the following table:

Setting Value Description **Name**A globally unique name The name must uniquely identify your new function app. Accept the suggested name or enter a new name. The following characters are valid: `a-z`

,`0-9`

, and`-`

.**Subscription name**The name of your subscription The function app is created in an Azure subscription. Accept the default subscription or select a different one from the list. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)The name of your resource group The function app is created in a resource group. Select **New**to create a new resource group. You can also select an existing resource group from the list.[Plan Type](functions-scale)**Flex Consumption**When you publish your project to a function app that runs in a [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan), you might pay only for executions of your functions app. Other hosting plans can incur higher costs.**IMPORTANT:**

When creating a Flex Consumption plan, you must first select**App service plan**and then reselect**Flex Consumption**to clear an issue with the dialog.**Operating system****Linux**The Flex Consumption plan currently requires Linux. **Location**The location of the app service Select a location in an [Azure region supported by the Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-how-to#view-currently-supported-regions). When an unsupported region is selected, the**Create**button is grayed-out.**Instance memory size****2048**The [memory size of the virtual machine instances](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes)in which the app runs is unique to the Flex Consumption plan.[Azure Storage](storage-considerations)A general-purpose storage account The Functions runtime requires a Storage account. Select **New**to configure a general-purpose storage account. You can also use an existing account that meets the[storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).[Application Insights](functions-monitoring)An Application Insights instance You should turn on Application Insights integration for your function app. Select **New**to create a new instance, either in a new or in an existing Log Analytics workspace. You can also use an existing instance.Select

**Create**to create a function app and its related resources in Azure. The status of resource creation is shown in the lower-left corner of the window.Select

**Finish**. The**Publish profile creation progress**window appears. When the profile is created, select**Close**.On the publish profile page, select

**Publish**to deploy the package that contains your project files to your new function app in Azure.When deployment is complete, the root URL of the function app in Azure is shown on the publish profile page.

On the publish profile page, go to the

**Hosting**section. Select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select**Open in Azure portal**. The new function app Azure resource opens in the Azure portal.

## Verify your function in Azure

In the Azure portal, you should be in the

**Overview**page for your new functions app.Under

**Functions**, select your new function named**HttpExample**, then in the function page select**Get function URL**and then the**Copy to clipboard icon**.In the address bar in your browser, paste the URL you copied and run the request.

The URL that calls your HTTP trigger function is in the following format:

`https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

Go to this URL and you see a response in the browser to the remote GET request returned by the function, which looks like the following example:


## Clean up resources

*Resources* in Azure refer to function apps, functions, storage accounts, and so forth. They're grouped into *resource groups*, and you can delete everything in a group by deleting the group.

You created Azure resources to complete this quickstart. You could be billed for these resources, depending on your [account status](https://azure.microsoft.com/account/) and [service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/). Other quickstarts in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to work with subsequent quickstarts, tutorials, or with any of the services you've created in this quickstart, don't clean up the resources.

Use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

In the Visual Studio Publish dialogue, in the Hosting section, select

**Open in Azure portal**.In the function app page, select the

**Overview**tab and then select the link under**Resource group**.In the

**Resource group**page, review the list of included resources, and verify that they're the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**, and follow the instructions.Deletion may take a couple of minutes. When it's done, a notification appears for a few seconds. You can also select the bell icon at the top of the page to view the notification.


## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used Visual Studio to create and publish a C# function app in Azure with a simple HTTP trigger function.

To learn more about working with C# functions that run in an isolated worker process, see the [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). Check out [.NET supported versions](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions) to see other versions of supported .NET versions in an isolated worker process.
