## Install the Azure Functions Core Tools

The recommended way to install Core Tools depends on the operating system of your local development computer.

The following steps use a Windows installer (MSI) to install Core Tools v4.x. For more information about other package-based installers, see the [Core Tools readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/v4.x/README.md#windows).

Download and run the Core Tools installer, based on your version of Windows:

[v4.x - Windows 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174087)(Recommended.[Visual Studio Code debugging](functions-develop-vs-code#debugging-functions-locally)requires 64-bit.)[v4.x - Windows 32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174159)

If you previously used Windows installer (MSI) to install Core Tools on Windows, you should uninstall the old version from Add Remove Programs before installing the latest version.

Tip

To install Core Tools on [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/en-us/windows/wsl/install), follow the instructions on the Linux tab.

For help with version-related issues, see [Core Tools versions](#v2).

## Create your local project

Important

For Python, you must run Core Tools commands in a virtual environment. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Python function in Azure from the command line](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-python#create-venv).

In the terminal window or from a command prompt, run the following command to create a project in the `MyProjFolder`

folder:

```
func init MyProjFolder --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated
```


By default this command creates a project that runs in-process with the Functions host on the current [Long-Term Support (LTS) version of .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle). You can use the `--target-framework`

option to target a specific supported version of .NET, including .NET Framework. For more information, see the [ func init](functions-core-tools-reference#func-init) reference.

For a comparison between the two .NET process models, see the [process mode comparison article](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

Java uses a Maven archetype to create the local project, along with your first HTTP triggered function. Rather than using `func init`

and `func new`

, you should instead follow the steps in the [Command line quickstart](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-java).

This command creates a JavaScript project that uses the desired [programming model version](functions-reference-node).

This command creates a TypeScript project that uses the desired [programming model version](functions-reference-node).

```
func init MyProjFolder --worker-runtime powershell
```


This command creates a Python project that uses the desired [programming model version](functions-reference-python#programming-model).

When you run `func init`

without the `--worker-runtime`

option, you're prompted to choose your project language. To learn more about the available options for the `func init`

command, see the [ func init](functions-core-tools-reference#func-init) reference.

## Create a function

To add a function to your project, run the `func new`

command using the `--template`

option to select your trigger template. The following example creates an HTTP trigger named `MyHttpTrigger`

:

```
func new --template "Http Trigger" --name MyHttpTrigger
```


This example creates a Queue Storage trigger named `MyQueueTrigger`

:

```
func new --template "Azure Queue Storage Trigger" --name MyQueueTrigger
```


The following considerations apply when adding functions:

When you run

`func new`

without the`--template`

option, you're prompted to choose a template.Use the

command to see the complete list of available templates for your language.`func templates list`

When you add a trigger that connects to a service, you'll also need to add an application setting that references a connection string or a managed identity to the local.settings.json file. Using app settings in this way prevents you from having to embed credentials in your code. For more information, see

[Work with app settings locally](#local-settings).

- Core Tools also adds a reference to the specific binding extension to your C# project.

To learn more about the available options for the `func new`

command, see the [ func new](functions-core-tools-reference#func-new) reference.

## Add a binding to your function

Functions provides a set of service-specific input and output bindings, which make it easier for your function to connection to other Azure services without having to use the service-specific client SDKs. For more information, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

To add an input or output binding to an existing function, you must manually update the function definition.

The following example shows the function definition after adding a [Queue Storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output) to an [HTTP triggered function](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger):

Because an HTTP triggered function also returns an HTTP response, the function returns a `MultiResponse`

object, which represents both the HTTP and queue output.

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
```


This example is the definition of the `MultiResponse`

object that includes the output binding:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public IActionResult HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


When applying that example to your own project, you might need to change `HttpRequest`

to `HttpRequestData`

and `IActionResult`

to `HttpResponseData`

, depending on if you are using [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) or not.

Messages are sent to the queue when the function completes. The way you define the output binding depends on your process model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@FunctionName("HttpExample")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=java#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=javascript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=powershell#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@app.route(route="HttpExample")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
def HttpExample(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out [func.QueueMessage]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Python model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=python#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=typescript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

The following considerations apply when adding bindings to a function:

- For languages that define functions using the
*function.json*configuration file, Visual Studio Code simplifies the process of adding bindings to an existing function definition. For more information, see[Connect functions to Azure services using bindings](add-bindings-existing-function#visual-studio-code).

- When you add bindings that connect to a service, you must also add an application setting that references a connection string or managed identity to the local.settings.json file. For more information, see
[Work with app settings locally](#local-settings).

- When you add a supported binding, the extension should already be installed when your app uses extension bundle. For more information, see
[extension bundles](extension-bundles).

- When you add a binding that requires a new binding extension, you must also add a reference to that specific binding extension in your C# project.

For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=java#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=typescript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

## Start the Functions runtime

Before you can run or debug the functions in your project, you need to start the Functions host from the root directory of your project. The host enables triggers for all functions in the project. Use this command to start the local runtime:

```
mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```


```
func start
```


```
func start
```


```
npm install
npm start
```


This command must be [run in a virtual environment](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-python).

When the Functions host starts, it outputs a list of functions in the project, including the URLs of any HTTP-triggered functions, like in this example:

Found the following functions: Host.Functions.MyHttpTrigger Job host started Http Function MyHttpTrigger: http://localhost:7071/api/MyHttpTrigger

How your functions are loaded depends on your project configuration. To learn more, see [Registering a function](functions-reference-node#registering-a-function).

Keep in mind the following considerations when running your functions locally:

By default, authorization isn't enforced locally for HTTP endpoints. This means that all local HTTP requests are handled as

`authLevel = "anonymous"`

. For more information, see[Authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth). You can use the`--enableAuth`

option to require authorization when running locally. For more information, see`func start`

You can use the local Azurite emulator when locally running functions that require access to Azure Storage services (Queue Storage, Blob Storage, and Table Storage) without having to connect to these services in Azure. When using local emulation, make sure to start Azurite before starting the local host (func.exe). For more information, see

[Local storage emulation](functions-develop-local#local-storage-emulator).

- You can use local Azurite emulation to meet the storage requirement of the Python v2 worker.

You can trigger non-HTTP functions locally without connecting to a live service. For more information, see

[Run a local function](functions-run-local?tabs=non-http-trigger#run-a-local-function).When you include your Application Insights connection information in the local.settings.json file, local log data is written to the specific Application Insights instance. To keep local telemetry data separate from production data, consider using a separate Application Insights instance for development and testing.


- When using version 1.x of the Core Tools, instead use the
`func host start`

command to start the local runtime.

## Run a local function

With your local Functions host (func.exe) running, you can now trigger individual functions to run and debug your function code. The way in which you execute an individual function depends on its trigger type.

Note

Examples in this topic use the cURL tool to send HTTP requests from the terminal or a command prompt. You can use a tool of your choice to send HTTP requests to the local server. The cURL tool is available by default on Linux-based systems and Windows 10 build 17063 and later. On older Windows, you must first download and install the [cURL tool](https://curl.haxx.se/).

HTTP triggers are started by sending an HTTP request to the local endpoint and port as displayed in the func.exe output, which has this general format:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>
```


In this URL template, `<FUNCTION_NAME>`

is the name of the function or route and `<PORT>`

is the local port on which func.exe is listening.

For example, this cURL command triggers the `MyHttpTrigger`

quickstart function from a GET request with the *name* parameter passed in the query string:

```
curl --get http://localhost:7071/api/MyHttpTrigger?name=Azure%20Rocks
```


This example is the same function called from a POST request passing *name* in the request body, shown for both Bash shell and Windows command line:

```
curl --request POST http://localhost:7071/api/MyHttpTrigger --data '{"name":"Azure Rocks"}'
```


```
curl --request POST http://localhost:7071/api/MyHttpTrigger --data "{'name':'Azure Rocks'}"
```


The following considerations apply when calling HTTP endpoints locally:

You can make GET requests from a browser passing data in the query string. For all other HTTP methods, you must use an HTTP testing tool that also keeps your data secure. For more information, see

[HTTP test tools](functions-develop-local#http-test-tools).Make sure to use the same server name and port that the Functions host is listening on. You see an endpoint like this in the output generated when starting the Function host. You can call this URL using any HTTP method supported by the trigger.


## Publish to Azure

The Azure Functions Core Tools supports three types of deployment:

| Deployment type | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Project files |
`func azure functionapp publish` |

[zip deployment](functions-deployment-technologies#zip-deploy).`func azurecontainerapps deploy`

`func kubernetes deploy`

You must have either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell) installed locally to be able to publish to Azure from Core Tools. By default, Core Tools uses these tools to authenticate with your Azure account.

If you don't have these tools installed, you need to instead [get a valid access token](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-get-access-token) to use during deployment. You can present an access token using the `--access-token`

option in the deployment commands.

## Deploy project files

To publish your local code to a function app in Azure, use the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-functionapp-publish) command, as in the following example:

```
func azure functionapp publish <FunctionAppName>
```


This command publishes project files from the current directory to the `<FunctionAppName>`

as a .zip deployment package. If the project requires compilation, it's done remotely during deployment.

Java uses Maven to publish your local project to Azure instead of Core Tools. Use the following Maven command to publish your project to Azure:

```
mvn azure-functions:deploy
```


When you run this command, Azure resources are created during the initial deployment based on the settings in your *pom.xml* file. For more information, see [Deploy the function project to Azure](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-java#deploy-the-function-project-to-azure).

The following considerations apply to this kind of deployment:

Publishing overwrites existing files in the remote function app deployment.

You must have already

[created a function app in your Azure subscription](functions-cli-samples#create). Core Tools deploys your project code to this function app resource. To learn how to create a function app from the command prompt or terminal window using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, see[Create a Function App for serverless execution](scripts/functions-cli-create-serverless). You can also[create these resources in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal#create-a-function-app). You get an error when you try to publish to a`<FunctionAppName>`

that doesn't exist in your subscription.A project folder may contain language-specific files and directories that shouldn't be published. Excluded items are listed in a .funcignore file in the root project folder.

By default, your project is deployed so that it

[runs from the deployment package](run-functions-from-deployment-package). To disable this recommended deployment mode, use the.`--nozip`

optionA

[remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build)is performed on compiled projects. This can be controlled by using the.`--no-build`

optionUse the

option to automatically create app settings in your function app based on values in the local.settings.json file.`--publish-local-settings`

To publish to a specific named slot in your function app, use the

.`--slot`

option

## Deploy containers

Core Tools lets you deploy your [containerized function app](functions-create-container-registry) to both managed Azure Container Apps environments and Kubernetes clusters that you manage.

Use the following [ func azurecontainerapps deploy](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azurecontainerapps-deploy) command to deploy an existing container image to a Container Apps environment:

```
func azurecontainerapps deploy --name <APP_NAME> --environment <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_CONNECTION> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --image-name <IMAGE_NAME> [--registry-password] [--registry-server] [--registry-username]
```


When you deploy to an Azure Container Apps environment, the following considerations apply:

The environment and storage account must already exist. The storage account connection string you provide is used by the deployed function app.

You don't need to create a separate function app resource when deploying to Container Apps.

Storage connection strings and other service credentials are important secrets. Make sure to securely store any script files using

`func azurecontainerapps deploy`

and don't store them in any publicly accessible source control systems. You can[encrypt the local.settings.json file](#encrypt-the-local-settings-file)for added security.

For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

## Work with app settings locally

When your function app runs in Azure, settings required by your functions are [stored encrypted in app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings). During local development, these settings are instead added to the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. The *local.settings.json* file also stores settings used by local development tools.

Items in the `Values`

collection in your project's *local.settings.json* file are intended to mirror items in your function app's [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) in Azure.

The following considerations apply when working with the local settings file:

Because the local.settings.json may contain secrets, such as connection strings, you should never store it in a remote repository. Core Tools helps you encrypt this local settings file for improved security. For more information, see

[Local settings file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file). You can also[encrypt the local.settings.json file](#encrypt-the-local-settings-file)for added security.By default, local settings aren't migrated automatically when the project is published to Azure. Use the

option when you publish your project files to make sure these settings are added to the function app in Azure. Values in the`--publish-local-settings`

`ConnectionStrings`

section are never published. You can also[upload settings from the local.settings.json file](#upload-local-settings-to-azure)at any time.You can download and overwrite settings in your local.settings.json file with settings from your function app in Azure. For more information, see

[Download application settings](#download-application-settings).

- The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables).

- The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-java#environment-variables).

- The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables).

- The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-powershell#environment-variables).

- The function app settings values can also be read in your code as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables).

- When no valid storage connection string is set for
and a local storage emulator isn't being used, an error is shown. You can use Core Tools to`AzureWebJobsStorage`

[download a specific connection string](#download-a-storage-connection-string)from any of your Azure Storage accounts.

### Download application settings

From the project root, use the following command to download all application settings from the `myfunctionapp12345`

app in Azure:

```
func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings myfunctionapp12345
```


This command overwrites any existing settings in the local.settings.json file with values from Azure. When not already present, new items are added to the collection. For more information, see the [ func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-functionapp-fetch-app-settings) command.

### Download a storage connection string

Core Tools also make it easy to get the connection string of any storage account to which you have access. From the project root, use the following command to download the connection string from a storage account named `mystorage12345`

.

```
func azure storage fetch-connection-string mystorage12345
```


This command adds a setting named `mystorage12345_STORAGE`

to the local.settings.json file, which contains the connection string for the `mystorage12345`

account. For more information, see the [ func azure storage fetch-connection-string](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-storage-fetch-connection-string) command.

For improved security during development, consider [encrypting the local.settings.json file](#encrypt-the-local-settings-file).

### Upload local settings to Azure

When you publish your project files to Azure without using the `--publish-local-settings`

option, settings in the local.settings.json file aren't set in your function app. You can always rerun the `func azure functionapp publish`

with the `--publish-settings-only`

option to upload just the settings without republishing the project files.

The following example uploads just settings from the `Values`

collection in the local.settings.json file to the function app in Azure named `myfunctionapp12345`

:

```
func azure functionapp publish myfunctionapp12345 --publish-settings-only
```


### Encrypt the local settings file

To improve security of connection strings and other valuable data in your local settings, Core Tools lets you encrypt the local.settings.json file. When this file is encrypted, the runtime automatically decrypts the settings when needed the same way it does with application setting in Azure. You can also decrypt a locally encrypted file to work with the settings.

Use the following command to encrypt the local settings file for the project:

```
func settings encrypt
```


Use the following command to decrypt an encrypted local setting, so that you can work with it:

```
func settings decrypt
```


When the settings file is encrypted and decrypted, the file's `IsEncrypted`

setting also gets updated.

## Configure binding extensions

[Functions triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) are implemented as .NET extension (NuGet) packages. To be able to use a specific binding extension, that extension must be installed in the project.

This section doesn't apply to version 1.x of the Functions runtime. In version 1.x, supported bindings were included in the core product extension.

For C# class library projects, add references to the specific NuGet packages for the binding extensions required by your functions. C# script (.csx) project must use [extension bundles](extension-bundles).

Functions provides *extension bundles* to make is easy to work with binding extensions in your project. Extension bundles, which are versioned and defined in the host.json file, install a complete set of compatible binding extension packages for your app. Your host.json should already have extension bundles enabled. If for some reason you need to add or update the extension bundle in the host.json file, see [Extension bundles](extension-bundles).

If you must use a binding extension or an extension version not in a supported bundle, you need to manually install extensions. For such rare scenarios, see the [ func extensions install](functions-core-tools-reference#func-extensions-install) command.

## Core Tools versions

Major versions of Azure Functions Core Tools are linked to specific major versions of the Azure Functions runtime. For example, version 4.x of Core Tools supports version 4.x of the Functions runtime. This version is the recommended major version of both the Functions runtime and Core Tools. You can determine the latest release version of Core Tools in the [Azure Functions Core Tools repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/releases/latest).

[
Starting with version 4.0.6517 of the Core Tools, in-process model projects must reference ][version 4.5.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.5.0). If an earlier version is used, the

`func start`

command will error.Run the following command to determine the version of your current Core Tools installation:

```
func --version
```


Unless otherwise noted, the examples in this article are for version 4.x.

The following considerations apply to Core Tools installations:

You can only install one version of Core Tools on a given computer.

When upgrading to the latest version of Core Tools, you should use the same method that you used for original installation to perform the upgrade. For example, if you used an MSI on Windows, uninstall the current MSI and install the latest one. Or if you used npm, rerun the

`npm install command`

.Version 2.x and 3.x of Core Tools were used with versions 2.x and 3.x of the Functions runtime, which have reached their end of support. For more information, see

[Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions).

- Version 1.x of Core Tools is required when using version 1.x of the Functions Runtime, which is still supported. This version of Core Tools can only be run locally on Windows computers. If you're currently running on version 1.x, you should consider
[migrating your app to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4)today.

# Azure Event Hubs output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) bindings for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and output bindings for Event Hubs.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Use the Event Hubs output binding to write events to an event stream. You must have send permission to an event hub to write events to it.

Make sure the required package references are in place before you try to implement an output binding.

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that writes a message string to an event hub, using the method return value as the output:

```
[Function(nameof(EventHubFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
[EventHubOutput("dest", Connection = "EventHubConnection")]
public string EventHubFunction(
[EventHubTrigger("src", Connection = "EventHubConnection")] string[] input,
FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation("First Event Hubs triggered message: {msg}", input[0]);
var message = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return message;
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that sends a single message to an event hub:

```
import { app, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.eventHub({
eventHubName: 'myeventhub',
connection: 'MyEventHubSendAppSetting',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that sends a single message to an event hub:

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const eventHubOutput = output.eventHub({
eventHubName: 'myeventhub',
connection: 'MyEventHubSendAppSetting',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: eventHubOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

The following example shows an event hub trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. The function writes a message to an event hub. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="eventhub_output")
@app.route(route="eventhub_output")
@app.event_hub_output(arg_name="event",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def eventhub_output(req: func.HttpRequest, event: func.Out[str]):
body = req.get_body()
if body is not None:
event.set(body.decode('utf-8'))
else:
logging.info('req body is none')
return 'ok'
```


Here's Python code that sends multiple messages:

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
from typing import List
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="eventhub_output")
@app.route(route="eventhub_output")
@app.event_hub_output(arg_name="event",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def eventhub_output(req: func.HttpRequest, event: func.Out[List[str]]) -> func.HttpResponse:
my_messages=["message1", "message2","message3"]
event.set(my_messages)
return func.HttpResponse(f"Messages sent")
```


The following example shows a Java function that writes a message containing the current time to an event hub.

```
@FunctionName("sendTime")
@EventHubOutput(name = "event", eventHubName = "samples-workitems", connection = "AzureEventHubConnection")
public String sendTime(
@TimerTrigger(name = "sendTimeTrigger", schedule = "0 */5 * * * *") String timerInfo) {
return LocalDateTime.now().toString();
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@EventHubOutput`

annotation on parameters whose value would be published to Event Hubs. The parameter should be of type `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is a POJO or any native Java type.

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to configure the binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#event-hubs-output).

Use the [EventHubOutputAttribute] to define an output binding to an event hub, which supports the following properties.

| Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
EventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, these properties are supported for `event_hub_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The variable name used in function code that represents the event. |
`event_hub_name` |
he name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [EventHubOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhuboutput) annotation on parameters whose value would be published to Event Hubs. The following settings are supported on the annotation:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.eventHub()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
eventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, which differs by runtime version.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `eventHub` . |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This parameter is set automatically when you create the binding in the Azure portal. |
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the event. |
eventHubName |
Functions 2.x and higher. The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The parameter type supported by the Event Hubs output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

There are two options for outputting an Event Hubs message from a function by using the [EventHubOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhuboutput) annotation:

**Return value**: By applying the annotation to the function itself, the return value of the function is persisted as an Event Hubs message.**Imperative**: To explicitly set the message value, apply the annotation to a specific parameter of the type, where`OutputBinding<T>`

`T`

is a POJO or any native Java type. With this configuration, passing a value to the`setValue`

method persists the value as an Event Hubs message.

Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

There are two options for outputting an Event Hubs message from a function:

**Return value**: Set the`name`

property in*function.json*to`$return`

. With this configuration, the function's return value is persisted as an Event Hubs message.**Imperative**: Pass a value to the[set](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out#set-val--t-----none)method of the parameter declared as an[Out](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out)type. The value passed to`set`

is persisted as an Event Hubs message.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[func.EventHubEvent]`

or `func.Out[List[func.EventHubEvent]]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Event Hubs. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

Obtain this connection string by clicking the **Connection Information** button for the [namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace), not the event hub itself. The connection string must be for an Event Hubs namespace, not the event hub itself.

When used for triggers, the connection string must have at least "read" permissions to activate the function. When used for output bindings, the connection string must have "send" permissions to send messages to the event stream.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-event-hubs?tabs=extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Event Hubs namespace. | `myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net` |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your event hub at runtime. The scope of the role assignment can be for an Event Hubs namespace, or the event hub itself. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Event Hubs extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Trigger |
|

# Azure Tables bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Tables](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) via [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings). Integrating with Azure Tables allows you to build functions that read and write data using [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) and [Azure Table Storage](../storage/tables/table-storage-overview).

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Read table data in a function |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-storage-table-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The process for installing the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version allows you to bind to types from [ Azure.Data.Tables](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables). It also introduces the ability to use Azure Cosmos DB for Table.

This extension is available by installing the [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables) into a project using version 5.x or higher of the extensions for [blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob?tabs=isolated-process,extensionv5) and [queues](functions-bindings-storage-queue?tabs=isolated-process,extensionv5).

Using the .NET CLI:

```
# Install the Azure Tables extension
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables --version 1.0.0
# Update the combined Azure Storage extension (to a version which no longer includes Azure Tables)
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage --version 5.0.0
```


Note

Azure Blobs, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables now use separate extensions and are referenced individually. For example, to use the triggers and bindings for all three services in your .NET isolated-process app, you should add the following packages to your project:

[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs)[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues)[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables)

Previously, the extensions shipped together as [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage, version 4.x](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/4.0.4). This same package also has a [5.x version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/5.0.0), which references the split packages for blobs and queues only. When upgrading your package references from older versions, you may therefore need to additionally reference the new [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables) NuGet package. Also, when referencing these newer split packages, make sure you are not referencing an older version of the combined storage package, as this will result in conflicts from two definitions of the same bindings.

If you're writing your application using F#, you must also configure this extension as part of the app's [startup configuration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration). In the call to `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()`

or `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()`

, add a delegate that takes an `IFunctionsWorkerApplication`

parameter. Then within the body of that delegate, call `ConfigureTablesExtension()`

on the object:

```
let hostBuilder = new HostBuilder()
hostBuilder.ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(fun (context: HostBuilderContext) (appBuilder: IFunctionsWorkerApplicationBuilder) ->
appBuilder.ConfigureTablesExtension() |> ignore
) |> ignore
```


## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Data.Tables](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables) is in preview.

**Azure Tables input binding**

When working with a single table entity, the Azure Tables input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| A JSON serializable type that implements
|

[ITableEntity](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.itableentity)or have a string`RowKey`

property and a string `PartitionKey`

property.[TableEntity](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.tableentity)1When working with multiple entities from a query, the Azure Tables input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`IEnumerable<T>` where `T` implements
|
An enumeration of entities returned by the query. Each entry represents one entity. The type `T` must implement
`RowKey` property and a string `PartitionKey` property. |
1 |

1 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables 1.2.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables/1.2.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Azure Tables output binding**

When you want the function to write to a single entity, the Azure Tables output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| A JSON serializable type that implements [ITableEntity] | Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type as the entity. The type must implement [ITableEntity] or have a string `RowKey` property and a string `PartitionKey` property. |

When you want the function to write to multiple entities, the Azure Tables output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single entity types |
An array containing multiple entities. Each entry represents one entity. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [TableClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.tableclient) with other types from [Azure.Data.Tables](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

**Open**and then**Upload**.Go back to your function app logs and verify that the blob has been read.

Note

When your function app runs in the default Consumption plan, there may be a delay of up to several minutes between the blob being added or updated and the function being triggered. If you need low latency in your blob triggered functions, consider one of these

[other blob trigger options](storage-considerations#trigger-on-a-blob-container).

## Clean up resources

Other quickstarts in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to work with subsequent quickstarts, tutorials, or with any of the services you've created in this quickstart, don't clean up the resources.

*Resources* in Azure refer to function apps, functions, storage accounts, and so forth. They're grouped into *resource groups*, and you can delete everything in a group by deleting the group.

You've created resources to complete these quickstarts. You might be billed for these resources, depending on your [account status](https://azure.microsoft.com/account/) and [service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/). If you don't need the resources anymore, here's how to delete them:

In the Azure portal, go to the

**Resource group**page.To get to that page from the function app page, select the

**Overview**tab, and then select the link under**Resource group**.To get to that page from the dashboard, select

**Resource groups**, and then select the resource group that you used for this article.In the

**Resource group**page, review the list of included resources, and verify that they're the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**and follow the instructions.Deletion might take a couple of minutes. When it's done, a notification appears for a few seconds. You can also select the bell icon at the top of the page to view the notification.


## Next steps

You have created a function that runs when a blob is added to or updated in Blob storage. For more information about Blob storage triggers, see [Azure Functions Blob storage bindings](functions-bindings-storage-blob).

Now that you've created your first function, let's add an output binding to the function that writes a message to a Storage queue.
