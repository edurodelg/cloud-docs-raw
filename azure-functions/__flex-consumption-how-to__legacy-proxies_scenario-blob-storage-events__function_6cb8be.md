Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create function apps hosted in the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) in Azure Functions. It also shows you how to manage certain features of a Flex Consumption plan hosted app.

Function app resources are langauge-specific. Make sure to choose your preferred code development language at the beginning of the article.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can

[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).: used to create and manage resources in Azure. When using the Azure CLI on your local computer, make sure to use version 2.60.0, or a later version. You can also use[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)[Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview), which has the correct Azure CLI version.: used to create and develop apps, create Azure resources, and deploy code projects to Azure. When using Visual Studio Code, make sure to also install the latest[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code)[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). You can also install the[Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack).While not required to create a Flex Consumption plan app, you need a code project to be able to deploy to and validate a new function app. Complete the first part of one of these quickstart articles, where you create a code project with an HTTP triggered function:

[Create an Azure Functions project from the command line](how-to-create-function-azure-cli)[Create an Azure Functions project using Visual Studio Code](how-to-create-function-vs-code)

To create an app in a new Flex Consumption plan during a Maven deployment, you must create your local app project and then update the project's pom.xml file. For more information, see

[Create a Java Flex Consumption app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven)Return to this article after you create and run the local project, but before you're asked to create Azure resources. You create the function app and other Azure resources in the next section.


## Create a Flex Consumption app

This section shows you how to create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan by using either the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Visual Studio Code. For an example of creating an app in a Flex Consumption plan using Bicep/ARM templates, see the [Flex Consumption repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md#iac-samples-overview).

You can skip this section if you choose to instead [create and deploy your app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven).

To support your function code, you need to create three resources:

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A
[Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions. - A function app in the Flex Consumption plan, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources in the Flex Consumption plan.

If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure:

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the

`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations`

command to review the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption in alphabetical order.`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations --query "sort_by(@, &name)[].{Region:name}" -o table`


Create a resource group in one of the currently supported regions listed by the command in the previous step.

`az group create --name <RESOURCE_GROUP> --location <REGION>`

In the previous command, replace

`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

with a value that's unique in your subscription and`<REGION>`

with one of the currently supported regions. The[az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)command creates a resource group.Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region:

`az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location <REGION> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false`

In the previous example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with a name that's appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Names must contain three to 24 characters consisting of numbers and lowercase letters only.`Standard_LRS`

specifies a general-purpose account that Azure Functions supports according to[storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements). The[az storage account create](/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create)command creates the storage account.Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

Create the function app in Azure:

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0`

[C# apps that run in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library)aren't currently supported when running in a Flex Consumption plan.`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime java --runtime-version 17`

For Java apps, Java 11 is also currently supported.

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime node --runtime-version 20`

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime python --runtime-version 3.11`

For Python apps, Python 3.10 is also currently supported.

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime powershell --runtime-version 7.4`

In this example, replace both

`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

and`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the resource group and the name of the account you used in the previous step, respectively. Also replace`<APP_NAME>`

with a globally unique name appropriate to you. The`<APP_NAME>`

is also the default domain name server (DNS) domain for the function app. Thecommand creates the function app in Azure.`az functionapp create`

This command creates a function app running in the Flex Consumption plan.

Because you created the app without specifying

[always ready instances](#set-always-ready-instance-counts), your app only incurs costs when actively executing functions. The command also creates an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can monitor your function app and view logs. For more information, see[Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

## Deploy your code project

For deployment, Flex Consumption plan apps use a Blob storage container to host .zip package files that contain your project code and all libraries that are required for your app to run. For more information, see [Deployment](flex-consumption-plan#deployment).

You can skip this section if you choose to instead [create and deploy your app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven).

You can choose to deploy your project code to an existing function app using various tools:

You can use the Azure CLI to upload a deployment package file to the deployment share for a function app in Azure. To make this deployment, you must produce a .zip package file that can run when the package is mounted to your app.

This package file must contain all of the build output files and referenced libraries required for your project to run.

For projects with a large number of libraries, you should package the root of your project file and request a [remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

For Python projects, you should package the root of your project file and always request a [remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build). Using a remote build prevents potential issues that can occur when you build a project on Windows to be deployed on Linux.

Using your preferred development tool, build the code project.

Create a .zip file that contains the output of the build directory. For more information, see

[Project structure](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#project-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

command.`az login`

`az login`

Run the

command to deploy the application package located in the relative`az functionapp deployment source config-zip`

`<FILE_PATH>`

.`az functionapp deployment source config-zip --src <FILE_PATH> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>`


Using your preferred development tool, build the code project.

Create a .zip file that contains the output of the build directory. For more information, see

[Folder structure](functions-reference-java#folder-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

command.`az login`

`az login`

Run the

command to deploy the application package located in the relative`az functionapp deployment source config-zip`

`<FILE_PATH>`

.`az functionapp deployment source config-zip --src <FILE_PATH> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>`


Create a .zip file that contains the root directory of your code project. For more information, see

[Folder structure](functions-reference-powershell#folder-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

command.`az login`

`az login`

Run the

command to deploy the application package located in the relative`az functionapp deployment source config-zip`

`<FILE_PATH>`

.`az functionapp deployment source config-zip --src <FILE_PATH> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>`


Create a .zip file that contains the root directory of your code project. For more information, see

[Folder structure](functions-reference-node#folder-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

`<FILE_PATH>`

.`az functionapp deployment source config-zip --src <FILE_PATH> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --build-remote true`

Make sure to set

`--build-remote true`

to perform a[remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

Create a .zip file that contains the root directory of your code project. For more information, see

[Folder structure](functions-reference-python#folder-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

Make sure to set

`--build-remote true`

to perform a[remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

## Create and deploy your app using Maven

You can use Maven to create a Flex Consumption hosted function app and required resources during deployment by modifying the pom.xml file.

Create a Java code project by completing the first part of one of these quickstart articles:

In your Java code project, open the pom.xml file and make these changes to create your function app in the Flex Consumption plan:

Change the value of

`<properties>.<azure.functions.maven.plugin.version>`

to`1.34.0`

.In the

`<plugin>.<configuration>`

section for the`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

, add or uncomment the`<pricingTier>`

element as follows:`<pricingTier>Flex Consumption</pricingTier>`


(Optional) Customize the Flex Consumption plan in your Maven deployment by also including these elements in the

`<plugin>.<configuration>`

section: .`<instanceSize>`

- sets the[instance memory](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes)size for the function app. The default value is`2048`

.`<maximumInstances>`

- sets the highest value for the maximum instances count of the function app.`<alwaysReadyInstances>`

- sets the[always ready instance counts](flex-consumption-plan#always-ready-instances)with child elements for HTTP trigger groups (`<http>`

), Durable Functions groups (`<durable>`

), and other specific triggers (`<my_function>`

). When you set any instance count greater than zero, you're charged for these instances whether your functions execute or not. For more information, see[Billing](flex-consumption-plan#billing).

Before you can deploy, sign in to your Azure subscription using the Azure CLI.

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the following command to deploy your code project to a new function app in Flex Consumption.

`mvn azure-functions:deploy`

Maven uses settings in the pom.xml template to create your function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure, along with the other required resources. Should these resources already exist, the code is deployed to your function app, overwriting any existing code.


## Enable virtual network integration

You can enable [virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#virtual-network-integration) for your app in a Flex Consumption plan. The examples in this section assume that your account already contains a [virtual network and subnet](../virtual-network/quick-create-cli#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet). You can enable virtual network integration when you create your app or at a later time.

Important

The Flex Consumption plan currently doesn't support subnets with names that contain underscore (`_`

) characters.

To enable virtual networking when you create your app:

You can enable virtual network integration by running the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command and including the

`--vnet`

and `--subnet`

parameters.[Create the virtual network and subnet](../virtual-network/quick-create-cli#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet), if you don't have one already.Complete steps 1-4 in

[Create a Flex Consumption app](#create-a-flex-consumption-app)to create the resources required by your app.Run the

command, including the`az functionapp create`

`--vnet`

and`--subnet`

parameters, as in this example:`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime <RUNTIME_NAME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --vnet <VNET_RESOURCE_ID> --subnet <SUBNET_NAME>`

The

`<VNET_RESOURCE_ID>`

value is the resource ID for the virtual network, which is in the format:`/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<VNET_NAME>`

. You can use this command to get a list of virtual network IDs, filtered by`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

:`az network vnet list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --output tsv --query "[]".id`

.

For end-to-end examples of how to create apps in Flex Consumption with virtual network integration see these resources:

[Flex Consumption: HTTP to Event Hubs using virtual network integration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md)[Flex Consumption: triggered from Service Bus using virtual network integration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md)

To modify or delete virtual network integration in an existing app:

Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration add](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-add) command to enable virtual network integration to an existing function app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration add --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --vnet <VNET_RESOURCE_ID> --subnet <SUBNET_NAME>
```


Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration remove](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-remove) command to disable virtual network integration in your app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration remove --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME>
```


Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration list](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-list) command to list the current virtual network integrations for your app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME>
```


When you're choosing a subnet, these considerations apply:

- The subnet you choose can't already be used for other purposes, such as with private endpoints or service endpoints, or be delegated to any other hosting plan or service.
- You can't share the same subnet between a Container Apps environment and a Flex Consumption app.
- You can share the same subnet with more than one app running in a Flex Consumption plan. Because the networking resources are shared across all apps, one function app might affect the performance of others on the same subnet.
- In a Flex Consumption plan, a single function app might use up to 40 IP addresses, even when the app scales beyond 40 instances. While this rule of thumb is helpful when estimating the subnet size you need, it isn't strictly enforced.

## Configure deployment settings

In the Flex Consumption plan, the deployment package that contains your app's code is maintained in an Azure Blob Storage container. By default, deployments use the same storage account (`AzureWebJobsStorage`

) and connection string value used by the Functions runtime to maintain your app. The connection string is stored in the `DEPLOYMENT_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`

application setting. However, you can instead designate a blob container in a separate storage account as the deployment source for your code. You can also change the authentication method used to access the container.

A customized deployment source should meet this criteria:

- The storage account must already exist.
- The container to use for deployments must also exist.
- When more than one app uses the same storage account, each should have its own deployment container. Using a unique container for each app prevents the deployment packages from being overwritten, which would happen if apps shared the same container.

When configuring deployment storage authentication, keep these considerations in mind:

- As a security best practice, you should use managed identities when connecting to Azure Storage from your apps. For more information, see
[Connections](functions-reference#connections). - When you use a connection string to connect to the deployment storage account, the application setting that contains the connection string must already exist.
- When you use a user-assigned managed identity, the provided identity gets linked to the function app. The
`Storage Blob Data Contributor`

role scoped to the deployment storage account also gets assigned to the identity. - When you use a system-assigned managed identity, an identity gets created when a valid system-assigned identity doesn't already exist in your app. When a system-assigned identity does exists, the
`Storage Blob Data Contributor`

role scoped to the deployment storage account also gets assigned to the identity.

To configure deployment settings when you create your function app in the Flex Consumption plan:

Use the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command and supply these extra options that customize deployment storage:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`--deployment-storage-name` |
The name of the deployment storage account. |
`--deployment-storage-container-name` |
The name of the container in the account to contain your app's deployment package. |
`--deployment-storage-auth-type` |
The authentication type to use for connecting to the deployment storage account. Accepted values include `StorageAccountConnectionString` , `UserAssignedIdentity` , and `SystemAssignedIdentity` . |
`--deployment-storage-auth-value` |
When using `StorageAccountConnectionString` , this parameter is set to the name of the application setting that contains the connection string to the deployment storage account. When you set `UserAssignedIdentity` , this parameter is set to the name of the resource ID of the identity you want to use. |

This example creates a function app in the Flex Consumption plan with a separate deployment storage account and user assigned identity:

```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0 --flexconsumption-location "<REGION>" --deployment-storage-name <DEPLOYMENT_ACCOUNT_NAME> --deployment-storage-container-name <DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER_NAME> --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value <MI_RESOURCE_ID>
```


You can also modify the deployment storage configuration for an existing app.

Use the [ az functionapp deployment config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/deployment/config#az-functionapp-deployment-config-set) command to modify the deployment storage configuration:

```
az functionapp deployment config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --deployment-storage-name <DEPLOYMENT_ACCOUNT_NAME> --deployment-storage-container-name <DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER_NAME>
```


## Configure instance memory

The instance memory size used by your Flex Consumption plan can be explicitly set when you create your app. For more information about supported sizes, see [Instance sizes](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes).

To set an instance memory size that's different from the default when creating your app:

Specify the `--instance-memory`

parameter in your [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. This example creates a C# app with an instance size of

`4096`

:```
az functionapp create --instance-memory 4096 --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0
```


At any point, you can change the instance memory size setting used by your app.

This example uses the [ az functionapp scale config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config#az-functionapp-scale-config-set) command to change the instance memory size setting to 512 MB:

```
az functionapp scale config set --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <APP_NAME> --instance-memory 512
```


## Set always ready instance counts

You can set a specific number of always ready instances for the [Per-function scaling](flex-consumption-plan#per-function-scaling) groups or individual functions, to keep your functions loaded and ready to execute. There are three special groups, as in per-function scaling:

`http`

- All of the HTTP triggered functions in the app scale together into their own instances.`durable`

- All of the Durable triggered functions (Orchestration, Activity, Entity) in the app scale together into their own instances.`blob`

- All of the blob (Event Grid) triggered functions in the app scale together into their own instances.

Use `http`

, `durable`

, or `blob`

as the name for the name value pair setting to configure always ready counts for these groups. For all other functions in the app you need to configure always ready for each individual function using the format `function:<FUNCTION_NAME>=n`

.

To define one or more always ready instance designations, use the `--always-ready-instances`

parameter with the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. This example sets the always ready instance count for all HTTP triggered functions to

`10`

:```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --always-ready-instances http=10
```


This example sets the always ready instance count for all Durable trigger functions to `3`

and sets the always ready instance count to `2`

for a service bus triggered function named `function5`

:

```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --always-ready-instances durable=3 function:function5=2
```


You can also modify always ready instances on an existing app by adding or removing instance designations or by changing existing instance designation counts.

This example uses the [ az functionapp scale config always-ready set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config/always-ready#az-functionapp-scale-config-always-ready-set) command to change the always ready instance count for the HTTP triggers group to

`10`

:```
az functionapp scale config always-ready set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --settings http=10
```


To remove always ready instances, use the [ az functionapp scale config always-ready delete](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config/always-ready#az-functionapp-scale-config-always-ready-delete) command, as in this example that removes all always ready instances from both the HTTP triggers group and also a function named

`hello_world`

:```
az functionapp scale config always-ready delete --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --setting-names http function:hello_world
```


## Set HTTP concurrency limits

Unless you set specific limits, HTTP concurrency defaults for Flex Consumption plan apps are determined based on your instance size setting. For more information, see [HTTP trigger concurrency](functions-concurrency#http-trigger-concurrency).

Here's how you can set HTTP concurrency limits for an existing app:

Use the [ az functionapp scale config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config#az-functionapp-scale-config-set) command to set specific HTTP concurrency limits for your app, regardless of instance size.

```
az functionapp scale config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --trigger-type http --trigger-settings perInstanceConcurrency=10
```


This example sets the HTTP trigger concurrency level to `10`

. After you specifically set an HTTP concurrency value, that value is maintained despite any changes in your app's instance size setting.

## Set site update strategy

The Flex Consumption plan uniquely supports two different site update strategies that control how your function app handles code deployments and configuration changes. By default, Flex Consumption plan apps use the `Recreate`

strategy, which terminates currently executing functions during deployments. To enable zero-downtime deployments, you can configure the `RollingUpdate`

strategy instead. For more information, see [Site update strategies in Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-site-updates).

Note

Site update strategy configuration is currently in public preview and is only available through Bicep or ARM templates. You can't configure this setting using the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Visual Studio Code.

Site update strategy configuration isn't currently supported in the Azure CLI. Use Bicep or ARM templates as described in [Configure site update strategy](flex-consumption-site-updates#configure-your-update-strategy).

## View currently supported regions

To view the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption plans:

If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure:

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the

`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations`

command to review the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption in alphabetical order.`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations --query "sort_by(@, &name)[].{Region:name}" -o table`


When you create an app in the [Azure portal](flex-consumption-how-to?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-flex-consumption-app) or by using [Visual Studio Code](flex-consumption-how-to?tabs=vs-code#create-a-flex-consumption-app), currently unsupported regions are filtered out of the region list.

## Monitor your app in Azure

Azure Monitor provides these distinct sets of metrics to help you better understand how your function app runs in Azure:

- Platform metrics: provides infrastructure-level insights
- Application Insights: provides code-level insights, including traces and errors logs.

If you [enable Application Insights in your app](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration), you're able to:

- Track detailed execution times and dependencies
- Monitor individual function performance
- Analyze failures and exceptions
- Correlate platform metrics with application behavior with custom queries

For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions).

### Supported metrics

Run this script to view all of the platform metrics that are currently available your app:

```
appId=$(az functionapp show --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --query id -o tsv)
az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource $appId --query "[].{Name:name.localizedValue,Value:name.value}" -o table
```


In this example, replace `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

and `<APP_NAME>`

with your resource group and function app names, respectively. This script gets the fully qualified app ID and returns the available platform metrics in a table.

### View metrics

You can review current metrics either in the Azure portal or by using the Azure CLI.

In the Azure portal, you can also create metrics alerts and pin charts and other reports to dashboards in the portal.

Use this script to generate a report of the current metrics for your app:

```
appId=$(az functionapp show --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --query id -o tsv)
appId=$(az functionapp show --name func-fuxigh6c255de --resource-group exampleRG --query id -o tsv)
echo -e "\nAlways-ready and on-emand execution counts..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionCount" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "OnDemandFunctionExecutionCount" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nExecution units (MB-ms) in always-ready and on-emand execution counts..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "OnDemandFunctionExecutionUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nAlways-ready resource utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nMemory utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AverageMemoryWorkingSet" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "MemoryWorkingSet" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nInstance count and CPU utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "InstanceCount" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "CpuPercentage" --interval PT1H --output table
```


To learn more about metrics for Azure Functions, see [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions).

### View logs

When your app is connected to Application Insights, you can better analyze your app performance and troubleshoot problems during execution.

- Use "Performance" to analyze response times and dependencies
- Use "Failures" to identify any errors occurring after migration
- Create custom queries in "Logs" to analyze function behavior. For example:

Use this query to compare success rates by instance:

```
requests
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| summarize successCount=countif(success == true), failureCount=countif(success == false) by bin(timestamp, 1h), cloud_RoleName
| render timechart
```


Use this query to analyze the number of instances that were actively processing your function:

```
let _startTime = ago(20m); //Adjust start time as needed
let _endTime = now(); //Adjust end time as needed
let bins = 1s; //Adjust bin as needed - this will give per second results
requests
| where operation_Name == 'EventHubsTrigger' //Replace with the name of the function in the function app that you are analyzing
| where timestamp between(_startTime .. _endTime)
| make-series dcount(cloud_RoleInstance) default=0 on timestamp from _startTime to _endTime step bins
| render columnchart

### View costs

Because you can tune your app to adjust performance versus operating costs, it's important to track the costs associated with running your app in the Flex Consumption plan.

To view the current costs:

In your function app page in the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the resource group link.In the resource group page, select

**Cost Management**>**Cost analysis**.Review the current costs and cost trajectory of the app itself.

Optionally, select

**Cost Management**>**Alerts**and then**+ Add**to create a new alert for the app.

## Fine-tune your app

The Flex Consumption plan provides several settings that you can tune to refine the performance of your app. Actual performance and costs can vary based on your app-specific workload patterns and configuration. For example, higher [memory instance sizes](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes) can improve performance for memory-intensive operations but at a higher cost per active period.

Here are some adjustments you can make to fine-tune performance versus cost:

[Adjust concurrency settings](functions-concurrency)to maximize throughput per instance.[Choose the appropriate memory size](#configure-instance-memory)for your workload. Higher memory sizes cost more but can improve performance.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

To help make it easier to migrate from existing proxy implementations, this article links to equivalent API Management content, when available.


This article explains how to configure and work with Azure Functions Proxies. With this feature, you can specify endpoints on your function app that are implemented by another resource. You can use these proxies to break a large API into multiple function apps (as in a microservice architecture), while still presenting a single API surface for clients.

Standard Functions billing applies to proxy executions. For more information, see [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).

## Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x

After [migrating your function app to version 4.x of the Functions runtime](migrate-version-3-version-4), you'll need to specifically reenable proxies. You should still switch to integrating your function apps with [Azure API Management](functions-proxies#api-management-integration) as soon as possible, and not just rely on proxies.

Re-enabling proxies requires you to set a flag in the `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`

application setting in one of the following ways:

If the

`AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`

setting doesn't already exists, add this setting to your function app with a value of`EnableProxies`

.If this setting already exists, add

`,EnableProxies`

to the end of the existing value.

[ AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsfeatureflags) is a comma-delimited array of flags used to enable preview and other temporary features. To learn more about how to create and modify application settings, see

[Work with application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings).

Note

Even when re-enabled using the `EnableProxies`

flag, you can't work with proxies in the Azure portal. Instead, you must work directly with the *proxies.json* file for your function app. For more information, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).

## Create a proxy

Important

For equivalent content using API Management, see [Expose serverless APIs from HTTP endpoints using Azure API Management](functions-openapi-definition).

Proxies are defined in the *proxies.json* file in the root of your function app. The steps in this section show you how to use the Azure portal to create this file in your function app. Not all languages and operating system combinations support in-portal editing. If you can't modify your function app files in the portal, you can instead create and deploy the equivalent `proxies.json`

file from the root of your local project folder. To learn more about portal editing support, see [Language support details](supported-languages#language-support-details).

- Open the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then go to your function app. - In the left pane, select
**Proxies**and then select**+Add**. - Provide a name for your proxy.
- Configure the endpoint that's exposed on this function app by specifying the
**route template**and**HTTP methods**. These parameters behave according to the rules for[HTTP triggers](functions-bindings-http-webhook). - Set the
**backend URL**to another endpoint. This endpoint could be a function in another function app, or it could be any other API. The value doesn't need to be static, and it can reference[application settings](#use-appsettings)and[parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters). - Select
**Create**.

Your proxy now exists as a new endpoint on your function app. From a client perspective, it's the same as an HttpTrigger in Functions. You can try out your new proxy by copying the **Proxy URL** and testing it with your favorite HTTP client.

## Modify requests and responses

Important

API Management lets you can change API behavior through configuration using policies. Policies are a collection of statements that are run sequentially on the request or response of an API. For more information about API Management policies, see [Policies in Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-howto-policies).

With proxies, you can modify requests to and responses from the back-end. These transformations can use variables as defined in [Use variables](#using-variables).

### Modify the back-end request

By default, the back-end request is initialized as a copy of the original request. In addition to setting the back-end URL, you can make changes to the HTTP method, headers, and query string parameters. The modified values can reference [application settings](#use-appsettings) and [parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters).

Back-end requests can be modified in the portal by expanding the *request override* section of the proxy detail page.

### Modify the response

By default, the client response is initialized as a copy of the back-end response. You can make changes to the response's status code, reason phrase, headers, and body. The modified values can reference [application settings](#use-appsettings), [parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters), and [parameters from the back-end response](#response-parameters).

Back-end responses can be modified in the portal by expanding the *response override* section of the proxy detail page.

## Use variables

The configuration for a proxy doesn't need to be static. You can condition it to use variables from the original client request, the back-end response, or application settings.

### Reference local functions

You can use `localhost`

to reference a function inside the same function app directly, without a roundtrip proxy request.

`"backendUri": "https://localhost/api/httptriggerC#1"`

will reference a local HTTP triggered function at the route `/api/httptriggerC#1`


Note

If your function uses *function, admin or sys* authorization levels, you will need to provide the code and clientId, as per the original function URL. In this case the reference would look like: `"backendUri": "https://localhost/api/httptriggerC#1?code=<keyvalue>&clientId=<keyname>"`

We recommend storing these keys in [application settings](#use-appsettings) and referencing those in your proxies. This avoids storing secrets in your source code.

### Reference request parameters

You can use request parameters as inputs to the back-end URL property or as part of modifying requests and responses. Some parameters can be bound from the route template that's specified in the base proxy configuration, and others can come from properties of the incoming request.

#### Route template parameters

Parameters that are used in the route template are available to be referenced by name. The parameter names are enclosed in braces ({}).

For example, if a proxy has a route template, such as `/pets/{petId}`

, the back-end URL can include the value of `{petId}`

, as in `https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/pets/{petId}`

. If the route template terminates in a wildcard, such as `/api/{*restOfPath}`

, the value `{restOfPath}`

is a string representation of the remaining path segments from the incoming request.

#### Additional request parameters

In addition to the route template parameters, the following values can be used in config values:

**{request.method}**: The HTTP method that's used on the original request.**{request.headers.<HeaderName>}**: A header that can be read from the original request. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to read. If the header isn't included on the request, the value will be the empty string.**{request.querystring.<ParameterName>}**: A query string parameter that can be read from the original request. Replace*<ParameterName>*with the name of the parameter that you want to read. If the parameter isn't included on the request, the value will be the empty string.

### Reference back-end response parameters

Response parameters can be used as part of modifying the response to the client. The following values can be used in config values:

**{backend.response.statusCode}**: The HTTP status code that's returned on the back-end response.**{backend.response.statusReason}**: The HTTP reason phrase that's returned on the back-end response.**{backend.response.headers.<HeaderName>}**: A header that can be read from the back-end response. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header you want to read. If the header isn't included on the response, the value will be the empty string.

### Reference application settings

You can also reference [application settings defined for the function app](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) by surrounding the setting name with percent signs (%).

For example, a back-end URL of *https://%ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST%/api/orders* would have "%ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST%" replaced with the value of the ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST setting.

Tip

Use application settings for back-end hosts when you have multiple deployments or test environments. That way, you can make sure that you are always talking to the right back-end for that environment.

## Troubleshoot Proxies

By adding the flag `"debug":true`

to any proxy in your `proxies.json`

, you'll enable debug logging. Logs are stored in `D:\home\LogFiles\Application\Proxies\DetailedTrace`

and accessible through the advanced tools (kudu). Any HTTP responses will also contain a `Proxy-Trace-Location`

header with a URL to access the log file.

You can debug a proxy from the client side by adding a `Proxy-Trace-Enabled`

header set to `true`

. This will also log a trace to the file system, and return the trace URL as a header in the response.

### Block proxy traces

For security reasons you may not want to allow anyone calling your service to generate a trace. They won't be able to access the trace contents without your sign-in credentials, but generating the trace consumes resources and exposes that you're using Function Proxies.

Disable traces altogether by adding `"debug":false`

to any particular proxy in your `proxies.json`

.

## Advanced configuration

The proxies that you configure are stored in a *proxies.json* file, which is located in the root of a function app directory. You can manually edit this file and deploy it as part of your app when you use any of the [deployment methods](functions-continuous-deployment) that Functions supports.

Tip

If you have not set up one of the deployment methods, you can also work with the *proxies.json* file in the portal. Go to your function app, select **Platform features**, and then select **App Service Editor**. By doing so, you can view the entire file structure of your function app and then make changes.

*Proxies.json* is defined by a proxies object, which is composed of named proxies and their definitions. Optionally, if your editor supports it, you can reference a [JSON schema](http://json.schemastore.org/proxies) for code completion. An example file might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>"
}
}
}
```


Each proxy has a friendly name, such as *proxy1* in the preceding example. The corresponding proxy definition object is defined by the following properties:

**matchCondition**: Required--an object defining the requests that trigger the execution of this proxy. It contains two properties that are shared with[HTTP triggers](functions-bindings-http-webhook):*methods*: An array of the HTTP methods that the proxy responds to. If it isn't specified, the proxy responds to all HTTP methods on the route.*route*: Required--defines the route template, controlling which request URLs your proxy responds to. Unlike in HTTP triggers, there's no default value.

**backendUri**: The URL of the back-end resource to which the request should be proxied. This value can reference application settings and parameters from the original client request. If this property isn't included, Azure Functions responds with an HTTP 200 OK.**requestOverrides**: An object that defines transformations to the back-end request. See[Define a requestOverrides object](#requestOverrides).**responseOverrides**: An object that defines transformations to the client response. See[Define a responseOverrides object](#responseOverrides).

Note

The *route* property in Azure Functions Proxies does not honor the *routePrefix* property of the Function App host configuration. If you want to include a prefix such as `/api`

, it must be included in the *route* property.

### Disable individual proxies

You can disable individual proxies by adding `"disabled": true`

to the proxy in the `proxies.json`

file. This will cause any requests meeting the matchCondition to return 404.

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"Root": {
"disabled":true,
"matchCondition": {
"route": "/example"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>"
}
}
}
```


### Application Settings

The proxy behavior can be controlled by several app settings. They're all outlined in the [Functions App Settings reference](functions-app-settings)

### Reserved Characters (string formatting)

Proxies read all strings out of a JSON file, using \ as an escape symbol. Proxies also interpret curly braces. See a full set of examples below.

| Character | Escaped Character | Example |
|---|---|---|
| { or } | {{ or }} | `{{ example }}` --> `{ example }` |
| \ | \\ | `example.com\\text.html` --> `example.com\text.html` |
| " | \" | `\"example\"` --> `"example"` |

### Define a requestOverrides object

The requestOverrides object defines changes made to the request when the back-end resource is called. The object is defined by the following properties:

**backend.request.method**: The HTTP method that's used to call the back-end.**backend.request.querystring.<ParameterName>**: A query string parameter that can be set for the call to the back-end. Replace*<ParameterName>*with the name of the parameter that you want to set. If an empty string is provided, the parameter is still included on the back-end request.**backend.request.headers.<HeaderName>**: A header that can be set for the call to the back-end. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to set. If an empty string is provided, the parameter is still included on the back-end request.

Values can reference application settings and parameters from the original client request.

An example configuration might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>",
"requestOverrides": {
"backend.request.headers.Accept": "application/xml",
"backend.request.headers.x-functions-key": "%ANOTHERAPP_API_KEY%"
}
}
}
}
```


### Define a responseOverrides object

The requestOverrides object defines changes that are made to the response that's passed back to the client. The object is defined by the following properties:

**response.statusCode**: The HTTP status code to be returned to the client.**response.statusReason**: The HTTP reason phrase to be returned to the client.**response.body**: The string representation of the body to be returned to the client.**response.headers.<HeaderName>**: A header that can be set for the response to the client. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to set. If you provide the empty string, the header isn't included on the response.

Values can reference application settings, parameters from the original client request, and parameters from the back-end response.

An example configuration might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"responseOverrides": {
"response.body": "Hello, {test}",
"response.headers.Content-Type": "text/plain"
}
}
}
}
```


Note

In this example, the response body is set directly, so no `backendUri`

property is needed. The example shows how you might use Azure Functions Proxies for mocking APIs.

# Quickstart: Respond to blob storage events by using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you use Visual Studio Code to build an app that responds to events in a Blob Storage container. After testing the code locally by using an emulator, you deploy it to a new serverless function app running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project uses the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`

) extension with Visual Studio Code to simplify initializing and verifying your project code locally, as well as deploying your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

This article supports version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions.

This article supports version 2 of the Python programming model for Azure Functions.

## Initialize the project

Use the `azd init`

command from the command palette to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace where you want to create your project.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Initialize App (init)`

, then choose**Select a template**.There might be a slight delay while

`azd`

initializes the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions C# Event Grid Blob Trigger using Azure Developer CLI`

.When prompted in the terminal, enter a unique environment name, such as

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`blobevents-powershell`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace.

In `azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

## Add the local.settings.json file

Functions needs the local.settings.json file to configure the host when running locally.

Run this command to go to the

`src`

app folder:`cd src`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "java", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "powershell", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION": "7.2", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python", "PDFProcessorSTORAGE": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true" } }`


## Create and activate a virtual environment

In the `src`

folder, run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python doesn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


## Set up local storage emulator

Use the Azurite emulator to run your code project locally before creating and using Azure resources.

If you haven't already,

[install Azurite](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite#install-azurite).Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azurite: Start`

to start the local storage emulator.In the

**Azure**area, expand**Workspace**>**Attached Storage Accounts**>**Local Emulator**, right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac)**Blob Containers**, select**Create Blob Container...**, and create these two blob storage containers in the local emulator:`unprocessed-pdf`

: container that the trigger monitors for storage events.`processed-pdf`

: container where the function sends processed blobs as output.

Expand

**Blob Containers**, right-click (Ctrl-click on Mac)**unprocessed-pdf**, select**Upload Files...**, press`Enter`to accept the root directory, and upload the PDF files from the`data`

project folder.

When running locally, you can use REST to trigger the function by simulating the function receiving a message from an event subscription.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer by using the Azurite emulator. The `PDFProcessorSTORAGE`

environment variable defines the storage account connection, which is also set to `"UseDevelopmentStorage=true"`

in the local.settings.json file when running locally.

Run this command from the

`src`

project folder in a terminal or command prompt:`func start`

`mvn clean package mvn azure-functions:run`

`npm install func start`

`npm install npm start`

When the Functions host starts, it writes the name of the trigger and the trigger type to the terminal output. In Functions, the project root folder contains the host.json file.

With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, open the`test.http`

file in your project and select**Send Request**to trigger the`ProcessBlobUpload`

function by sending a test blob event to the blob event webhook.This step simulates receiving an event from an event subscription when running locally, and you should see the request and processed file information written in the logs. If you aren't using

*REST Client*, you must use another secure REST tool to call the endpoint with the payload in`test.http`

.In the Workspace area for the blob container, expand

**processed-pdf**and verify that the function processed the PDF file and copied it with a`processed-`

prefix.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload.cs project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/ProcessBlobUpload.cs). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`BlobTrigger`

with`Source = BlobTriggerSource.EventGrid`

for near real-time processing - Bind to
`BlobClient`

for the source blob and`BlobContainerClient`

for the destination - Process blob content and copy it to another container by using streams

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [function_app.py project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/function_app.py). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`@app.blob_trigger`

with`source="EventGrid"`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using the
`InputStream`

parameter - Copy processed files to the destination container using the Azure Storage SDK

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [processBlobUpload.ts project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/functions/processBlobUpload.ts). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`app.storageBlob()`

with`source: 'EventGrid'`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using the Node.js Azure Storage SDK
- Process and copy files to the destination container asynchronously

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload.java project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-java-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/samples/ProcessBlobUpload.java). The function demonstrates how to:

- Use
`@BlobTrigger`

with`source = "EventGrid"`

for near real-time processing - Access blob content using
`BlobInputStream`

parameter - Copy processed files to the destination container using Azure Storage SDK for Java

You can review the code that defines the Event Grid blob trigger in the [ProcessBlobUpload/run.ps1 project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/processBlobUpload/run.ps1) and the corresponding [function.json](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-powershell-azd-eventgrid-blob/blob/main/src/processBlobUpload/function.json). The function demonstrates how to:

- Configure blob trigger with
`"source": "EventGrid"`

in function.json for near real-time processing - Access blob content using PowerShell Azure Storage cmdlets
- Process and copy files to the destination container using Azure PowerShell modules

After you review and verify your function code locally, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Create Azure resources and deploy

Use the `azd up`

command to create the function app in a Flex Consumption plan along with other required Azure resources, including the event subscription. After the infrastructure is ready, `azd`

also deploys your project code to the new function app in Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Sign In with Azure Developer CLI`

, then sign in by using your Azure account.In the project root, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Provision and Deploy (up)`

to create the required Azure resources and deploy your code.When prompted in the Terminal window, provide these required deployment parameters:

Prompt Description Select an Azure Subscription to use Choose the subscription in which you want to create your resources. *Environment name*An environment that's used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. The

`azd up`

command uses your responses to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to create and configure these required Azure resources, following the latest best practices:- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Storage account with blob containers
- Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Event Grid subscription for blob events
- Service-to-service connections by using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)

After the command completes successfully, your app runs in Azure with an event subscription configured to trigger your function when blobs are added to the

`unprocessed-pdf`

container.Make a note of the

`AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

and`AZURE_FUNCTION_APP_NAME`

in the output. These names are unique for your storage account and function app in Azure, respectively.

## Verify the deployed function

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Storage: Upload Files...`

. Accept the root directory, and as before, upload one or more PDF files from the`data`

project folder.When prompted, select the name of your new storage account (from

`AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`

). Select**Blob Containers**>**unprocessed-pdf**.Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Storage: Open in Explorer`

. Select the same storage account >**Blob Containers**>**processed-pdf**, then**Open in new window**.In the Explorer, verify that the PDF files you uploaded were processed by your function. The output is written to the

`processed-pdf`

container with a`processed-`

prefix.

The Event Grid blob trigger processes files within seconds of upload. This speed demonstrates the near real-time capabilities of this approach compared to traditional polling-based blob triggers.

## Redeploy your code

Run the `azd up`

command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that were used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure. This action helps you avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

## Code project

At the core of Azure Functions is a language-specific code project that implements one or more units of code execution called *functions*. Functions are simply methods that run in the Azure cloud based on events, in response to HTTP requests, or on a schedule. Think of your Azure Functions code project as a mechanism for organizing, deploying, and collectively managing your individual functions in the project when they're running in Azure. For more information, see [Organize your functions](functions-best-practices#organize-your-functions).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For detailed language-specific guidance, see the [C# developers guide](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Java developers guide](functions-reference-java).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Node.js developers guide](functions-reference-node).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [PowerShell developers guide](functions-reference-powershell).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Python developers guide](functions-reference-python).

All functions must have a trigger, which defines how the function starts and can provide input to the function. Your functions can optionally define input and output bindings. These bindings simplify connections to other services without you having to work with client SDKs. For more information, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

Azure Functions provides a set of language-specific project and function templates that make it easy to create new code projects and add functions to your project. You can use any of the tools that support Azure Functions development to generate new apps and functions using these templates.

## Development tools

The following tools provide an integrated development and publishing experience for Azure Functions in your preferred language:

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-develop-local)(command prompt)

These tools integrate with [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-develop-local) so that you can run and debug on your local computer using the Functions runtime. For more information, see [Code and test Azure Functions locally](functions-develop-local).

[ There's also an editor in the Azure portal that lets you update your code and your ]*function.json* definition file directly in the portal. You should only use this editor for small changes or creating proof-of-concept functions. You should always develop your functions locally, when possible. For more information, see [Create your first function in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal).

Portal editing is only supported for [Node.js version 3](functions-reference-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v3), which uses the function.json file.

## Deployment

When you publish your code project to Azure, you're essentially deploying your project to an existing function app resource. A function app provides an execution context in Azure in which your functions run. As such, it's the unit of deployment and management for your functions. From an Azure Resource perspective, a function app is equivalent to a site resource (`Microsoft.Web/sites`

) in Azure App Service, which is equivalent to a web app.

A function app is composed of one or more individual functions that are managed, deployed, and scaled together. All of the functions in a function app share the same [pricing plan](functions-scale), [deployment method](functions-deployment-technologies), and [runtime version](functions-versions). For more information, see [How to manage a function app](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings).

When the function app and any other required resources don't already exist in Azure, you first need to create these resources before you can deploy your project files. You can create these resources in one of these ways:

- During
[Visual Studio](functions-develop-vs#publish-to-azure)publishing

Using

[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code#publish-to-azure)Programmatically using

[Azure CLI](scripts/functions-cli-create-serverless),[Azure PowerShell](create-resources-azure-powershell#create-a-serverless-function-app-for-c),[ARM templates](functions-create-first-function-resource-manager), or[Bicep files](functions-create-first-function-bicep)In the

[Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal)

In addition to tool-based publishing, Functions supports other technologies for deploying source code to an existing function app. For more information, see [Deployment technologies in Azure Functions](functions-deployment-technologies).

## Connect to services

A major requirement of any cloud-based compute service is reading data from and writing data to other cloud services. Functions provides an extensive set of bindings that makes it easier for you to connect to services without having to work with client SDKs.

Whether you use the binding extensions provided by Functions or you work with client SDKs directly, you securely store connection data and do not include it in your code. For more information, see [Connections](#connections).

### Bindings

Functions provides bindings for many Azure services and a few third-party services, which are implemented as extensions. For more information, see the [complete list of supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

Binding extensions can support both inputs and outputs, and many triggers also act as input bindings. Bindings let you configure the connection to services so that the Functions host can handle the data access for you. For more information, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

If you're having issues with errors coming from bindings, see the [Azure Functions Binding Error Codes](functions-bindings-error-pages) documentation.

### Client SDKs

While Functions provides bindings to simplify data access in your function code, you're still able to use a client SDK in your project to directly access a given service, if you prefer. You might need to use client SDKs directly should your functions require a functionality of the underlying SDK that's not supported by the binding extension.

When using client SDKs, you should use the same process for [storing and accessing connection strings](#connections) used by binding extensions.

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-java#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-powershell#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables).

## Connections

As a security best practice, Azure Functions takes advantage of the application settings functionality of Azure App Service to help you more securely store strings, keys, and other tokens required to connect to other services. Application settings in Azure are stored encrypted and can be accessed at runtime by your app as environment variable `name`

`value`

pairs. For triggers and bindings that require a connection property, you set the application setting name instead of the actual connection string. You can't configure a binding directly with a connection string or key.

For example, consider a trigger definition that has a `connection`

property. Instead of the connection string, you set `connection`

to the name of an environment variable that contains the connection string. Using this secrets access strategy both makes your apps more secure and makes it easier for you to change connections across environments. For even more security, you can use identity-based connections.

The default configuration provider uses environment variables. These variables are defined in [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings) when running in the Azure and in the [local settings file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) when developing locally.

### Connection values

When the connection name resolves to a single exact value, the runtime identifies the value as a *connection string*, which typically includes a secret. The details of a connection string depend on the service to which you connect.

However, a connection name can also refer to a collection of multiple configuration items, useful for configuring [identity-based connections](#configure-an-identity-based-connection). Environment variables can be treated as a collection by using a shared prefix that ends in double underscores `__`

. The group can then be referenced by setting the connection name to this prefix.

For example, the `connection`

property for an Azure Blob trigger definition might be `Storage1`

. As long as there's no single string value configured by an environment variable named `Storage1`

, an environment variable named `Storage1__blobServiceUri`

could be used to inform the `blobServiceUri`

property of the connection. The connection properties are different for each service. Refer to the documentation for the component that uses the connection.

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `Storage1:blobServiceUri`

.

### Configure an identity-based connection

Some connections in Azure Functions can be configured to use an identity instead of a secret. Support depends on the runtime version and the extension using the connection. In some cases, a connection string may still be required in Functions even though the service to which you're connecting supports identity-based connections. For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

Note

When running in a Consumption or Elastic Premium plan, your app uses the [ WEBSITE_AZUREFILESCONNECTIONSTRING](functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring) and

[settings when connecting to Azure Files on the storage account used by your function app. Azure Files doesn't support using managed identity when accessing the file share. For more information, see](functions-app-settings#website_contentshare)

`WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE`

[Azure Files supported authentication scenarios](../storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-overview#supported-authentication-scenarios)

Identity-based connections are only supported on Functions 4.x, If you are using version 1.x, you must first [migrate to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

The following components support identity-based connections:

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

Choose one of these tabs to learn about permissions for each component:

-
[Azure Blobs extension](#tabpanel_1_blob) -
[Azure Queues extension](#tabpanel_1_queue) -
[Azure Tables extension](#tabpanel_1_table) -
[Event Hubs extension](#tabpanel_1_eventhubs) -
[Service Bus extension](#tabpanel_1_servicebus) -
[Event Grid extension](#tabpanel_1_eventgrid) -
[Azure Cosmos DB extension](#tabpanel_1_cosmos) -
[Azure SignalR extension](#tabpanel_1_signalr) -
[Azure Web PubSub extension](#tabpanel_1_web-pubsub) -
[Durable Functions storage provider](#tabpanel_1_durable) -
[Functions host storage](#tabpanel_1_azurewebjobsstorage)

You need to create a role assignment that provides access to your blob container at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Blob Storage extension in normal operation. Your application may require further permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
and
1Extra permissions must also be granted to the AzureWebJobsStorage connection. 2 |

[Storage Blob Data Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader)[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)1 The blob trigger handles failure across multiple retries by writing [poison blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs) to a queue on the storage account specified by the connection.

2 The AzureWebJobsStorage connection is used internally for blobs and queues that enable the trigger. If it's configured to use an identity-based connection, it needs extra permissions beyond the default requirement. The required permissions are covered by the [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner), [Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor), and [Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) roles. To learn more, see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity).

#### Common properties for identity-based connections

An identity-based connection for an Azure service accepts the following common properties, where `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>`

is the value of your `connection`

property in the trigger or binding definition:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Token Credential | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__credential` |
This property determines how a token should be obtained for the connection. The property shouldn't be set in
`managedidentity` . When you intend to
`managedidentityasfederatedidentity` . |

`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used.This property is used differently in cross-tenant scenarios. See the

[cross-tenant scenarios](#connecting-to-a-resource-in-another-tenant)section.This property is used differently in

[local development scenarios](#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used.Other options may be supported for a given connection type. Refer to the documentation for the component making the connection.

##### Azure SDK Environment Variables

Caution

Use of the Azure SDK's [ EnvironmentCredential](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) environment variables is not recommended due to the potentially unintentional impact on other connections. They also are not fully supported when deployed to Azure Functions.

The environment variables associated with the Azure SDK's [ EnvironmentCredential](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) can also be set, but these are not processed by the Functions service for scaling in Consumption plans. These environment variables are not specific to any one connection and will apply as a default unless a corresponding property is not set for a given connection. For example, if

`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`

is set, this would be used as if `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

had been configured. Explicitly setting `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

would override this default.##### Local development with identity-based connections

Note

Local development with identity-based connections requires version `4.0.3904`

of [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local), or a later version.

When you're running your function project locally, the above configuration tells the runtime to use your local developer identity. The connection attempts to get a token from the following locations, in order:

- A local cache shared between Microsoft applications
- The current user context in Visual Studio
- The current user context in Visual Studio Code
- The current user context in the Azure CLI

If none of these options are successful, an error occurs.

Your identity may already have some role assignments against Azure resources used for development, but those roles may not provide the necessary data access. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. Double-check what permissions are required for connections for each component, and make sure that you have them assigned to yourself.

In some cases, you may wish to specify use of a different identity. You can add configuration properties for the connection that point to the alternate identity based on a client ID and client Secret for a Microsoft Entra service principal. **This configuration option is not supported when hosted in the Azure Functions service.** To use an ID and secret on your local machine, define the connection with the following extra properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId` |
The Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) ID. |
| Client ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId` |
The client (application) ID of an app registration in the tenant. |
| Client secret | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientSecret` |
A client secret that was generated for the app registration. |

Here's an example of `local.settings.json`

properties required for identity-based connection to Azure Blobs:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__blobServiceUri": "<blobServiceUri>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__queueServiceUri": "<queueServiceUri>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId": "<tenantId>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId": "<clientId>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientSecret": "<clientSecret>"
}
}
```


#### Connecting to host storage with an identity

The Azure Functions host uses the storage connection set in [ AzureWebJobsStorage](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) to enable core behaviors such as coordinating singleton execution of timer triggers and default app key storage. This connection can also be configured to use an identity.

Caution

Other components in Functions rely on `AzureWebJobsStorage`

for default behaviors. You should not move it to an identity-based connection if you are using older versions of extensions that do not support this type of connection, including triggers and bindings for Azure Blobs, Event Hubs, and Durable Functions. Similarly, `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used for deployment artifacts when using server-side build in Linux Consumption, and if you enable this, you will need to deploy via [an external deployment package](run-functions-from-deployment-package).

In addition, your function app might be reusing `AzureWebJobsStorage`

for other storage connections in their triggers, bindings, and/or function code. Make sure that all uses of `AzureWebJobsStorage`

are able to use the identity-based connection format before changing this connection from a connection string.

To use an identity-based connection for `AzureWebJobsStorage`

, configure the following app settings:

| Setting | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`AzureWebJobsStorage__blobServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of the blob service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net |
`AzureWebJobsStorage__queueServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of the queue service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.queue.core.windows.net |
`AzureWebJobsStorage__tableServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of a table service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net |

[Common properties for identity-based connections](#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections) may also be set as well.

If you're configuring `AzureWebJobsStorage`

using a storage account that uses the default DNS suffix and service name for global Azure, following the `https://<accountName>.[blob|queue|file|table].core.windows.net`

format, you can instead set `AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`

to the name of your storage account. The endpoints for each storage service are inferred for this account. This doesn't work when the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.

| Setting | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName` |
The account name of a storage account, valid only if the account isn't in a sovereign cloud and doesn't have a custom DNS. This syntax is unique to `AzureWebJobsStorage` and can't be used for other identity-based connections. |
<storage_account_name> |

You need to create a role assignment that provides access to the storage account for "AzureWebJobsStorage" at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) role covers the basic needs of Functions host storage - the runtime needs both read and write access to blobs and the ability to create containers. Several extensions use this connection as a default location for blobs, queues, and tables, and these uses may add requirements as noted in the table below. You may also need other permissions if you use "AzureWebJobsStorage" for any other purposes.

| Extension | Roles required | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
No extension (host only) |
|

This scenario represents the minimum set of permissions for normal operation, but it doesn't include support for diagnostic events

1.*No extension (host only), with support for diagnostic events*1[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)[Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor),[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor)[blob receipts](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#blob-receipts). It uses the AzureWebJobsStorage connection for these purposes, regardless of the connection configured for the trigger.[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)[Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)[Durable Functions extension configuration](durable/durable-functions-bindings#host-json).1 For some types of issues, Azure Functions can raise a diagnostic event that can assist with troubleshooting, even when the issue prevents the function app from starting. If [Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor) isn't assigned, you might see warnings in your logs about the inability to write these events.

#### Connecting to a resource in another tenant

If your function needs to connect to a resource in a different Microsoft Entra tenant, your connection needs to use a *federated identity credential*. This requires a user-assigned managed identity and a multi-tenant Entra ID app registration. You cannot use a system-assigned managed identity for cross-tenant connections.

Important

When you configure a trigger for a cross-tenant connection in the Consumption or Flex Consumption plan types, the platform no longer scales the function app based on that trigger.

To configure a cross-tenant identity-based connection, you first need to set up your infrastructure using the following steps:

- In the tenant where your function app is deployed,
[create a new user-assigned managed identity](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity). [Assign that identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json#add-a-user-assigned-identity)to the function app.- In the same tenant,
[create a multi-tenant Entra app registration](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity#configure-a-multi-tenant-app-registration)that represents the cross-tenant resource you want to access. [Add the managed identity as a federated identity credential for the app registration.](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity)- In the tenant where the resource is deployed,
[create an enterprise application for the app registration](/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant). - Assign permissions for the enterprise application to access the resource.

A cross-tenant identity-based connection uses the following properties, where `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>`

is the value of your `connection`

property in the trigger or binding definition:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create function apps hosted in the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) in Azure Functions. It also shows you how to manage certain features of a Flex Consumption plan hosted app.

Function app resources are langauge-specific. Make sure to choose your preferred code development language at the beginning of the article.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can

[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).: used to create and manage resources in Azure. When using the Azure CLI on your local computer, make sure to use version 2.60.0, or a later version. You can also use[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)[Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview), which has the correct Azure CLI version.: used to create and develop apps, create Azure resources, and deploy code projects to Azure. When using Visual Studio Code, make sure to also install the latest[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code)[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). You can also install the[Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack).While not required to create a Flex Consumption plan app, you need a code project to be able to deploy to and validate a new function app. Complete the first part of one of these quickstart articles, where you create a code project with an HTTP triggered function:

[Create an Azure Functions project from the command line](how-to-create-function-azure-cli)[Create an Azure Functions project using Visual Studio Code](how-to-create-function-vs-code)

To create an app in a new Flex Consumption plan during a Maven deployment, you must create your local app project and then update the project's pom.xml file. For more information, see

[Create a Java Flex Consumption app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven)Return to this article after you create and run the local project, but before you're asked to create Azure resources. You create the function app and other Azure resources in the next section.


## Create a Flex Consumption app

This section shows you how to create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan by using either the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Visual Studio Code. For an example of creating an app in a Flex Consumption plan using Bicep/ARM templates, see the [Flex Consumption repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md#iac-samples-overview).

You can skip this section if you choose to instead [create and deploy your app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven).

To support your function code, you need to create three resources:

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A
[Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions. - A function app in the Flex Consumption plan, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources in the Flex Consumption plan.

If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure:

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the

`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations`

command to review the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption in alphabetical order.`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations --query "sort_by(@, &name)[].{Region:name}" -o table`


Create a resource group in one of the currently supported regions listed by the command in the previous step.

`az group create --name <RESOURCE_GROUP> --location <REGION>`

In the previous command, replace

`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

with a value that's unique in your subscription and`<REGION>`

with one of the currently supported regions. The[az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)command creates a resource group.Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region:

`az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location <REGION> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false`

In the previous example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with a name that's appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Names must contain three to 24 characters consisting of numbers and lowercase letters only.`Standard_LRS`

specifies a general-purpose account that Azure Functions supports according to[storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements). The[az storage account create](/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create)command creates the storage account.Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

Create the function app in Azure:

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0`

[C# apps that run in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library)aren't currently supported when running in a Flex Consumption plan.`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime java --runtime-version 17`

For Java apps, Java 11 is also currently supported.

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime node --runtime-version 20`

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime python --runtime-version 3.11`

For Python apps, Python 3.10 is also currently supported.

`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime powershell --runtime-version 7.4`

In this example, replace both

`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

and`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the resource group and the name of the account you used in the previous step, respectively. Also replace`<APP_NAME>`

with a globally unique name appropriate to you. The`<APP_NAME>`

is also the default domain name server (DNS) domain for the function app. Thecommand creates the function app in Azure.`az functionapp create`

This command creates a function app running in the Flex Consumption plan.

Because you created the app without specifying

[always ready instances](#set-always-ready-instance-counts), your app only incurs costs when actively executing functions. The command also creates an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can monitor your function app and view logs. For more information, see[Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

## Deploy your code project

For deployment, Flex Consumption plan apps use a Blob storage container to host .zip package files that contain your project code and all libraries that are required for your app to run. For more information, see [Deployment](flex-consumption-plan#deployment).

You can skip this section if you choose to instead [create and deploy your app using Maven](#create-and-deploy-your-app-using-maven).

You can choose to deploy your project code to an existing function app using various tools:

You can use the Azure CLI to upload a deployment package file to the deployment share for a function app in Azure. To make this deployment, you must produce a .zip package file that can run when the package is mounted to your app.

This package file must contain all of the build output files and referenced libraries required for your project to run.

For projects with a large number of libraries, you should package the root of your project file and request a [remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

For Python projects, you should package the root of your project file and always request a [remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build). Using a remote build prevents potential issues that can occur when you build a project on Windows to be deployed on Linux.

Using your preferred development tool, build the code project.

Create a .zip file that contains the output of the build directory. For more information, see

[Project structure](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#project-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

command.`az login`

`az login`

Run the

command to deploy the application package located in the relative`az functionapp deployment source config-zip`

`<FILE_PATH>`

.`az functionapp deployment source config-zip --src <FILE_PATH> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>`


Using your preferred development tool, build the code project.

Create a .zip file that contains the output of the build directory. For more information, see

[Folder structure](functions-reference-java#folder-structure).When required, sign in to your Azure account and select the active subscription using the

command.`az login`

`az login`

Run the

command to deploy the application package located in the relative`az functionapp deployment source config-zip`

Make sure to set

`--build-remote true`

to perform a[remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

## Create and deploy your app using Maven

You can use Maven to create a Flex Consumption hosted function app and required resources during deployment by modifying the pom.xml file.

Create a Java code project by completing the first part of one of these quickstart articles:

In your Java code project, open the pom.xml file and make these changes to create your function app in the Flex Consumption plan:

Change the value of

`<properties>.<azure.functions.maven.plugin.version>`

to`1.34.0`

.In the

`<plugin>.<configuration>`

section for the`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

, add or uncomment the`<pricingTier>`

element as follows:`<pricingTier>Flex Consumption</pricingTier>`


(Optional) Customize the Flex Consumption plan in your Maven deployment by also including these elements in the

`<plugin>.<configuration>`

section: .`<instanceSize>`

- sets the[instance memory](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes)size for the function app. The default value is`2048`

.`<maximumInstances>`

- sets the highest value for the maximum instances count of the function app.`<alwaysReadyInstances>`

- sets the[always ready instance counts](flex-consumption-plan#always-ready-instances)with child elements for HTTP trigger groups (`<http>`

), Durable Functions groups (`<durable>`

), and other specific triggers (`<my_function>`

). When you set any instance count greater than zero, you're charged for these instances whether your functions execute or not. For more information, see[Billing](flex-consumption-plan#billing).

Before you can deploy, sign in to your Azure subscription using the Azure CLI.

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the following command to deploy your code project to a new function app in Flex Consumption.

`mvn azure-functions:deploy`

Maven uses settings in the pom.xml template to create your function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure, along with the other required resources. Should these resources already exist, the code is deployed to your function app, overwriting any existing code.


## Enable virtual network integration

You can enable [virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#virtual-network-integration) for your app in a Flex Consumption plan. The examples in this section assume that your account already contains a [virtual network and subnet](../virtual-network/quick-create-cli#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet). You can enable virtual network integration when you create your app or at a later time.

Important

The Flex Consumption plan currently doesn't support subnets with names that contain underscore (`_`

) characters.

To enable virtual networking when you create your app:

You can enable virtual network integration by running the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command and including the

`--vnet`

and `--subnet`

parameters.[Create the virtual network and subnet](../virtual-network/quick-create-cli#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet), if you don't have one already.Complete steps 1-4 in

[Create a Flex Consumption app](#create-a-flex-consumption-app)to create the resources required by your app.Run the

command, including the`az functionapp create`

`--vnet`

and`--subnet`

parameters, as in this example:`az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime <RUNTIME_NAME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --vnet <VNET_RESOURCE_ID> --subnet <SUBNET_NAME>`

The

`<VNET_RESOURCE_ID>`

value is the resource ID for the virtual network, which is in the format:`/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<VNET_NAME>`

. You can use this command to get a list of virtual network IDs, filtered by`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

:`az network vnet list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --output tsv --query "[]".id`

.

For end-to-end examples of how to create apps in Flex Consumption with virtual network integration see these resources:

[Flex Consumption: HTTP to Event Hubs using virtual network integration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md)[Flex Consumption: triggered from Service Bus using virtual network integration](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-flex-consumption-samples/blob/main/README.md)

To modify or delete virtual network integration in an existing app:

Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration add](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-add) command to enable virtual network integration to an existing function app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration add --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --vnet <VNET_RESOURCE_ID> --subnet <SUBNET_NAME>
```


Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration remove](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-remove) command to disable virtual network integration in your app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration remove --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME>
```


Use the [ az functionapp vnet-integration list](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/vnet-integration#az-functionapp-vnet-integration-list) command to list the current virtual network integrations for your app:

```
az functionapp vnet-integration list --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME>
```


When you're choosing a subnet, these considerations apply:

- The subnet you choose can't already be used for other purposes, such as with private endpoints or service endpoints, or be delegated to any other hosting plan or service.
- You can't share the same subnet between a Container Apps environment and a Flex Consumption app.
- You can share the same subnet with more than one app running in a Flex Consumption plan. Because the networking resources are shared across all apps, one function app might affect the performance of others on the same subnet.
- In a Flex Consumption plan, a single function app might use up to 40 IP addresses, even when the app scales beyond 40 instances. While this rule of thumb is helpful when estimating the subnet size you need, it isn't strictly enforced.

## Configure deployment settings

In the Flex Consumption plan, the deployment package that contains your app's code is maintained in an Azure Blob Storage container. By default, deployments use the same storage account (`AzureWebJobsStorage`

) and connection string value used by the Functions runtime to maintain your app. The connection string is stored in the `DEPLOYMENT_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`

application setting. However, you can instead designate a blob container in a separate storage account as the deployment source for your code. You can also change the authentication method used to access the container.

A customized deployment source should meet this criteria:

- The storage account must already exist.
- The container to use for deployments must also exist.
- When more than one app uses the same storage account, each should have its own deployment container. Using a unique container for each app prevents the deployment packages from being overwritten, which would happen if apps shared the same container.

When configuring deployment storage authentication, keep these considerations in mind:

- As a security best practice, you should use managed identities when connecting to Azure Storage from your apps. For more information, see
[Connections](functions-reference#connections). - When you use a connection string to connect to the deployment storage account, the application setting that contains the connection string must already exist.
- When you use a user-assigned managed identity, the provided identity gets linked to the function app. The
`Storage Blob Data Contributor`

role scoped to the deployment storage account also gets assigned to the identity. - When you use a system-assigned managed identity, an identity gets created when a valid system-assigned identity doesn't already exist in your app. When a system-assigned identity does exists, the
`Storage Blob Data Contributor`

role scoped to the deployment storage account also gets assigned to the identity.

To configure deployment settings when you create your function app in the Flex Consumption plan:

Use the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command and supply these extra options that customize deployment storage:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`--deployment-storage-name` |
The name of the deployment storage account. |
`--deployment-storage-container-name` |
The name of the container in the account to contain your app's deployment package. |
`--deployment-storage-auth-type` |
The authentication type to use for connecting to the deployment storage account. Accepted values include `StorageAccountConnectionString` , `UserAssignedIdentity` , and `SystemAssignedIdentity` . |
`--deployment-storage-auth-value` |
When using `StorageAccountConnectionString` , this parameter is set to the name of the application setting that contains the connection string to the deployment storage account. When you set `UserAssignedIdentity` , this parameter is set to the name of the resource ID of the identity you want to use. |

This example creates a function app in the Flex Consumption plan with a separate deployment storage account and user assigned identity:

```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0 --flexconsumption-location "<REGION>" --deployment-storage-name <DEPLOYMENT_ACCOUNT_NAME> --deployment-storage-container-name <DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER_NAME> --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value <MI_RESOURCE_ID>
```


You can also modify the deployment storage configuration for an existing app.

Use the [ az functionapp deployment config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/deployment/config#az-functionapp-deployment-config-set) command to modify the deployment storage configuration:

```
az functionapp deployment config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --deployment-storage-name <DEPLOYMENT_ACCOUNT_NAME> --deployment-storage-container-name <DEPLOYMENT_CONTAINER_NAME>
```


## Configure instance memory

The instance memory size used by your Flex Consumption plan can be explicitly set when you create your app. For more information about supported sizes, see [Instance sizes](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes).

To set an instance memory size that's different from the default when creating your app:

Specify the `--instance-memory`

parameter in your [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. This example creates a C# app with an instance size of

`4096`

:```
az functionapp create --instance-memory 4096 --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version 8.0
```


At any point, you can change the instance memory size setting used by your app.

This example uses the [ az functionapp scale config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config#az-functionapp-scale-config-set) command to change the instance memory size setting to 512 MB:

```
az functionapp scale config set --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <APP_NAME> --instance-memory 512
```


## Set always ready instance counts

You can set a specific number of always ready instances for the [Per-function scaling](flex-consumption-plan#per-function-scaling) groups or individual functions, to keep your functions loaded and ready to execute. There are three special groups, as in per-function scaling:

`http`

- All of the HTTP triggered functions in the app scale together into their own instances.`durable`

- All of the Durable triggered functions (Orchestration, Activity, Entity) in the app scale together into their own instances.`blob`

- All of the blob (Event Grid) triggered functions in the app scale together into their own instances.

Use `http`

, `durable`

, or `blob`

as the name for the name value pair setting to configure always ready counts for these groups. For all other functions in the app you need to configure always ready for each individual function using the format `function:<FUNCTION_NAME>=n`

.

To define one or more always ready instance designations, use the `--always-ready-instances`

parameter with the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command. This example sets the always ready instance count for all HTTP triggered functions to

`10`

:```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --always-ready-instances http=10
```


This example sets the always ready instance count for all Durable trigger functions to `3`

and sets the always ready instance count to `2`

for a service bus triggered function named `function5`

:

```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_NAME> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --always-ready-instances durable=3 function:function5=2
```


You can also modify always ready instances on an existing app by adding or removing instance designations or by changing existing instance designation counts.

This example uses the [ az functionapp scale config always-ready set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config/always-ready#az-functionapp-scale-config-always-ready-set) command to change the always ready instance count for the HTTP triggers group to

`10`

:```
az functionapp scale config always-ready set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --settings http=10
```


To remove always ready instances, use the [ az functionapp scale config always-ready delete](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config/always-ready#az-functionapp-scale-config-always-ready-delete) command, as in this example that removes all always ready instances from both the HTTP triggers group and also a function named

`hello_world`

:```
az functionapp scale config always-ready delete --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --setting-names http function:hello_world
```


## Set HTTP concurrency limits

Unless you set specific limits, HTTP concurrency defaults for Flex Consumption plan apps are determined based on your instance size setting. For more information, see [HTTP trigger concurrency](functions-concurrency#http-trigger-concurrency).

Here's how you can set HTTP concurrency limits for an existing app:

Use the [ az functionapp scale config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config#az-functionapp-scale-config-set) command to set specific HTTP concurrency limits for your app, regardless of instance size.

```
az functionapp scale config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --trigger-type http --trigger-settings perInstanceConcurrency=10
```


This example sets the HTTP trigger concurrency level to `10`

. After you specifically set an HTTP concurrency value, that value is maintained despite any changes in your app's instance size setting.

## Set site update strategy

The Flex Consumption plan uniquely supports two different site update strategies that control how your function app handles code deployments and configuration changes. By default, Flex Consumption plan apps use the `Recreate`

strategy, which terminates currently executing functions during deployments. To enable zero-downtime deployments, you can configure the `RollingUpdate`

strategy instead. For more information, see [Site update strategies in Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-site-updates).

Note

Site update strategy configuration is currently in public preview and is only available through Bicep or ARM templates. You can't configure this setting using the Azure CLI, Azure portal, or Visual Studio Code.

Site update strategy configuration isn't currently supported in the Azure CLI. Use Bicep or ARM templates as described in [Configure site update strategy](flex-consumption-site-updates#configure-your-update-strategy).

## View currently supported regions

To view the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption plans:

If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure:

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Use the

`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations`

command to review the list of regions that currently support Flex Consumption in alphabetical order.`az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations --query "sort_by(@, &name)[].{Region:name}" -o table`


When you create an app in the [Azure portal](flex-consumption-how-to?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-flex-consumption-app) or by using [Visual Studio Code](flex-consumption-how-to?tabs=vs-code#create-a-flex-consumption-app), currently unsupported regions are filtered out of the region list.

## Monitor your app in Azure

Azure Monitor provides these distinct sets of metrics to help you better understand how your function app runs in Azure:

- Platform metrics: provides infrastructure-level insights
- Application Insights: provides code-level insights, including traces and errors logs.

If you [enable Application Insights in your app](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration), you're able to:

- Track detailed execution times and dependencies
- Monitor individual function performance
- Analyze failures and exceptions
- Correlate platform metrics with application behavior with custom queries

For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions).

### Supported metrics

Run this script to view all of the platform metrics that are currently available your app:

```
appId=$(az functionapp show --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --query id -o tsv)
az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource $appId --query "[].{Name:name.localizedValue,Value:name.value}" -o table
```


In this example, replace `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

and `<APP_NAME>`

with your resource group and function app names, respectively. This script gets the fully qualified app ID and returns the available platform metrics in a table.

### View metrics

You can review current metrics either in the Azure portal or by using the Azure CLI.

In the Azure portal, you can also create metrics alerts and pin charts and other reports to dashboards in the portal.

Use this script to generate a report of the current metrics for your app:

```
appId=$(az functionapp show --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --query id -o tsv)
appId=$(az functionapp show --name func-fuxigh6c255de --resource-group exampleRG --query id -o tsv)
echo -e "\nAlways-ready and on-emand execution counts..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionCount" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "OnDemandFunctionExecutionCount" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nExecution units (MB-ms) in always-ready and on-emand execution counts..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "OnDemandFunctionExecutionUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nAlways-ready resource utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AlwaysReadyUnits" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nMemory utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "AverageMemoryWorkingSet" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "MemoryWorkingSet" --interval PT1H --output table
echo -e "\nInstance count and CPU utilization..."
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "InstanceCount" --interval PT1H --output table
az monitor metrics list --resource $appId --metric "CpuPercentage" --interval PT1H --output table
```

### View logs

When your app is connected to Application Insights, you can better analyze your app performance and troubleshoot problems during execution.

- Use "Performance" to analyze response times and dependencies
- Use "Failures" to identify any errors occurring after migration
- Create custom queries in "Logs" to analyze function behavior. For example:

Use this query to compare success rates by instance:

```
requests
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| summarize successCount=countif(success == true), failureCount=countif(success == false) by bin(timestamp, 1h), cloud_RoleName
| render timechart
```


Use this query to analyze the number of instances that were actively processing your function:

```
let _startTime = ago(20m); //Adjust start time as needed
let _endTime = now(); //Adjust end time as needed
let bins = 1s; //Adjust bin as needed - this will give per second results
requests
| where operation_Name == 'EventHubsTrigger' //Replace with the name of the function in the function app that you are analyzing
| where timestamp between(_startTime .. _endTime)
| make-series dcount(cloud_RoleInstance) default=0 on timestamp from _startTime to _endTime step bins
| render columnchart
```


### View costs

Because you can tune your app to adjust performance versus operating costs, it's important to track the costs associated with running your app in the Flex Consumption plan.

To view the current costs:

In your function app page in the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the resource group link.In the resource group page, select

**Cost Management**>**Cost analysis**.Review the current costs and cost trajectory of the app itself.

Optionally, select

**Cost Management**>**Alerts**and then**+ Add**to create a new alert for the app.

## Fine-tune your app

The Flex Consumption plan provides several settings that you can tune to refine the performance of your app. Actual performance and costs can vary based on your app-specific workload patterns and configuration. For example, higher [memory instance sizes](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes) can improve performance for memory-intensive operations but at a higher cost per active period.

Here are some adjustments you can make to fine-tune performance versus cost:

[Adjust concurrency settings](functions-concurrency)to maximize throughput per instance.[Choose the appropriate memory size](#configure-instance-memory)for your workload. Higher memory sizes cost more but can improve performance.
