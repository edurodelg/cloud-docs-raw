## Code project

At the core of Azure Functions is a language-specific code project that implements one or more units of code execution called *functions*. Functions are simply methods that run in the Azure cloud based on events, in response to HTTP requests, or on a schedule. Think of your Azure Functions code project as a mechanism for organizing, deploying, and collectively managing your individual functions in the project when they're running in Azure. For more information, see [Organize your functions](functions-best-practices#organize-your-functions).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For detailed language-specific guidance, see the [C# developers guide](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Java developers guide](functions-reference-java).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Node.js developers guide](functions-reference-node).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [PowerShell developers guide](functions-reference-powershell).

The way that you lay out your code project and how you indicate which methods in your project are functions depends on the development language of your project. For language-specific guidance, see the [Python developers guide](functions-reference-python).

All functions must have a trigger, which defines how the function starts and can provide input to the function. Your functions can optionally define input and output bindings. These bindings simplify connections to other services without you having to work with client SDKs. For more information, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

Azure Functions provides a set of language-specific project and function templates that make it easy to create new code projects and add functions to your project. You can use any of the tools that support Azure Functions development to generate new apps and functions using these templates.

## Development tools

The following tools provide an integrated development and publishing experience for Azure Functions in your preferred language:

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-develop-local)(command prompt)

These tools integrate with [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-develop-local) so that you can run and debug on your local computer using the Functions runtime. For more information, see [Code and test Azure Functions locally](functions-develop-local).

[ There's also an editor in the Azure portal that lets you update your code and your ]*function.json* definition file directly in the portal. You should only use this editor for small changes or creating proof-of-concept functions. You should always develop your functions locally, when possible. For more information, see [Create your first function in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal).

Portal editing is only supported for [Node.js version 3](functions-reference-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v3), which uses the function.json file.

## Deployment

When you publish your code project to Azure, you're essentially deploying your project to an existing function app resource. A function app provides an execution context in Azure in which your functions run. As such, it's the unit of deployment and management for your functions. From an Azure Resource perspective, a function app is equivalent to a site resource (`Microsoft.Web/sites`

) in Azure App Service, which is equivalent to a web app.

A function app is composed of one or more individual functions that are managed, deployed, and scaled together. All of the functions in a function app share the same [pricing plan](functions-scale), [deployment method](functions-deployment-technologies), and [runtime version](functions-versions). For more information, see [How to manage a function app](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings).

When the function app and any other required resources don't already exist in Azure, you first need to create these resources before you can deploy your project files. You can create these resources in one of these ways:

- During
[Visual Studio](functions-develop-vs#publish-to-azure)publishing

Using

[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code#publish-to-azure)Programmatically using

[Azure CLI](scripts/functions-cli-create-serverless),[Azure PowerShell](create-resources-azure-powershell#create-a-serverless-function-app-for-c),[ARM templates](functions-create-first-function-resource-manager), or[Bicep files](functions-create-first-function-bicep)In the

[Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal)

In addition to tool-based publishing, Functions supports other technologies for deploying source code to an existing function app. For more information, see [Deployment technologies in Azure Functions](functions-deployment-technologies).

## Connect to services

A major requirement of any cloud-based compute service is reading data from and writing data to other cloud services. Functions provides an extensive set of bindings that makes it easier for you to connect to services without having to work with client SDKs.

Whether you use the binding extensions provided by Functions or you work with client SDKs directly, you securely store connection data and do not include it in your code. For more information, see [Connections](#connections).

### Bindings

Functions provides bindings for many Azure services and a few third-party services, which are implemented as extensions. For more information, see the [complete list of supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

Binding extensions can support both inputs and outputs, and many triggers also act as input bindings. Bindings let you configure the connection to services so that the Functions host can handle the data access for you. For more information, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

If you're having issues with errors coming from bindings, see the [Azure Functions Binding Error Codes](functions-bindings-error-pages) documentation.

### Client SDKs

While Functions provides bindings to simplify data access in your function code, you're still able to use a client SDK in your project to directly access a given service, if you prefer. You might need to use client SDKs directly should your functions require a functionality of the underlying SDK that's not supported by the binding extension.

When using client SDKs, you should use the same process for [storing and accessing connection strings](#connections) used by binding extensions.

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-java#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-powershell#environment-variables).

When you create a client SDK instance in your functions, you should get the connection info required by the client from [Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables).

## Connections

As a security best practice, Azure Functions takes advantage of the application settings functionality of Azure App Service to help you more securely store strings, keys, and other tokens required to connect to other services. Application settings in Azure are stored encrypted and can be accessed at runtime by your app as environment variable `name`

`value`

pairs. For triggers and bindings that require a connection property, you set the application setting name instead of the actual connection string. You can't configure a binding directly with a connection string or key.

For example, consider a trigger definition that has a `connection`

property. Instead of the connection string, you set `connection`

to the name of an environment variable that contains the connection string. Using this secrets access strategy both makes your apps more secure and makes it easier for you to change connections across environments. For even more security, you can use identity-based connections.

The default configuration provider uses environment variables. These variables are defined in [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings) when running in the Azure and in the [local settings file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) when developing locally.

### Connection values

When the connection name resolves to a single exact value, the runtime identifies the value as a *connection string*, which typically includes a secret. The details of a connection string depend on the service to which you connect.

However, a connection name can also refer to a collection of multiple configuration items, useful for configuring [identity-based connections](#configure-an-identity-based-connection). Environment variables can be treated as a collection by using a shared prefix that ends in double underscores `__`

. The group can then be referenced by setting the connection name to this prefix.

For example, the `connection`

property for an Azure Blob trigger definition might be `Storage1`

. As long as there's no single string value configured by an environment variable named `Storage1`

, an environment variable named `Storage1__blobServiceUri`

could be used to inform the `blobServiceUri`

property of the connection. The connection properties are different for each service. Refer to the documentation for the component that uses the connection.

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `Storage1:blobServiceUri`

.

### Configure an identity-based connection

Some connections in Azure Functions can be configured to use an identity instead of a secret. Support depends on the runtime version and the extension using the connection. In some cases, a connection string may still be required in Functions even though the service to which you're connecting supports identity-based connections. For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

Note

When running in a Consumption or Elastic Premium plan, your app uses the [ WEBSITE_AZUREFILESCONNECTIONSTRING](functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring) and

[settings when connecting to Azure Files on the storage account used by your function app. Azure Files doesn't support using managed identity when accessing the file share. For more information, see](functions-app-settings#website_contentshare)

`WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE`

[Azure Files supported authentication scenarios](../storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-overview#supported-authentication-scenarios)

Identity-based connections are only supported on Functions 4.x, If you are using version 1.x, you must first [migrate to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

The following components support identity-based connections:

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

Choose one of these tabs to learn about permissions for each component:

-
[Azure Blobs extension](#tabpanel_1_blob) -
[Azure Queues extension](#tabpanel_1_queue) -
[Azure Tables extension](#tabpanel_1_table) -
[Event Hubs extension](#tabpanel_1_eventhubs) -
[Service Bus extension](#tabpanel_1_servicebus) -
[Event Grid extension](#tabpanel_1_eventgrid) -
[Azure Cosmos DB extension](#tabpanel_1_cosmos) -
[Azure SignalR extension](#tabpanel_1_signalr) -
[Azure Web PubSub extension](#tabpanel_1_web-pubsub) -
[Durable Functions storage provider](#tabpanel_1_durable) -
[Functions host storage](#tabpanel_1_azurewebjobsstorage)

You need to create a role assignment that provides access to your blob container at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Blob Storage extension in normal operation. Your application may require further permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
and
1Extra permissions must also be granted to the AzureWebJobsStorage connection. 2 |

[Storage Blob Data Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader)[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)1 The blob trigger handles failure across multiple retries by writing [poison blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs) to a queue on the storage account specified by the connection.

2 The AzureWebJobsStorage connection is used internally for blobs and queues that enable the trigger. If it's configured to use an identity-based connection, it needs extra permissions beyond the default requirement. The required permissions are covered by the [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner), [Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor), and [Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) roles. To learn more, see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity).

#### Common properties for identity-based connections

An identity-based connection for an Azure service accepts the following common properties, where `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>`

is the value of your `connection`

property in the trigger or binding definition:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Token Credential | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__credential` |
This property determines how a token should be obtained for the connection. The property shouldn't be set in
`managedidentity` . When you intend to
`managedidentityasfederatedidentity` . |

`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used.This property is used differently in cross-tenant scenarios. See the

[cross-tenant scenarios](#connecting-to-a-resource-in-another-tenant)section.This property is used differently in

[local development scenarios](#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used.Other options may be supported for a given connection type. Refer to the documentation for the component making the connection.

##### Azure SDK Environment Variables

Caution

Use of the Azure SDK's [ EnvironmentCredential](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) environment variables is not recommended due to the potentially unintentional impact on other connections. They also are not fully supported when deployed to Azure Functions.

The environment variables associated with the Azure SDK's [ EnvironmentCredential](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.environmentcredential) can also be set, but these are not processed by the Functions service for scaling in Consumption plans. These environment variables are not specific to any one connection and will apply as a default unless a corresponding property is not set for a given connection. For example, if

`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`

is set, this would be used as if `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

had been configured. Explicitly setting `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId`

would override this default.##### Local development with identity-based connections

Note

Local development with identity-based connections requires version `4.0.3904`

of [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local), or a later version.

When you're running your function project locally, the above configuration tells the runtime to use your local developer identity. The connection attempts to get a token from the following locations, in order:

- A local cache shared between Microsoft applications
- The current user context in Visual Studio
- The current user context in Visual Studio Code
- The current user context in the Azure CLI

If none of these options are successful, an error occurs.

Your identity may already have some role assignments against Azure resources used for development, but those roles may not provide the necessary data access. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. Double-check what permissions are required for connections for each component, and make sure that you have them assigned to yourself.

In some cases, you may wish to specify use of a different identity. You can add configuration properties for the connection that point to the alternate identity based on a client ID and client Secret for a Microsoft Entra service principal. **This configuration option is not supported when hosted in the Azure Functions service.** To use an ID and secret on your local machine, define the connection with the following extra properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId` |
The Microsoft Entra tenant (directory) ID. |
| Client ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId` |
The client (application) ID of an app registration in the tenant. |
| Client secret | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientSecret` |
A client secret that was generated for the app registration. |

Here's an example of `local.settings.json`

properties required for identity-based connection to Azure Blobs:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__blobServiceUri": "<blobServiceUri>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__queueServiceUri": "<queueServiceUri>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId": "<tenantId>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId": "<clientId>",
"<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientSecret": "<clientSecret>"
}
}
```


#### Connecting to host storage with an identity

The Azure Functions host uses the storage connection set in [ AzureWebJobsStorage](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) to enable core behaviors such as coordinating singleton execution of timer triggers and default app key storage. This connection can also be configured to use an identity.

Caution

Other components in Functions rely on `AzureWebJobsStorage`

for default behaviors. You should not move it to an identity-based connection if you are using older versions of extensions that do not support this type of connection, including triggers and bindings for Azure Blobs, Event Hubs, and Durable Functions. Similarly, `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used for deployment artifacts when using server-side build in Linux Consumption, and if you enable this, you will need to deploy via [an external deployment package](run-functions-from-deployment-package).

In addition, your function app might be reusing `AzureWebJobsStorage`

for other storage connections in their triggers, bindings, and/or function code. Make sure that all uses of `AzureWebJobsStorage`

are able to use the identity-based connection format before changing this connection from a connection string.

To use an identity-based connection for `AzureWebJobsStorage`

, configure the following app settings:

| Setting | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`AzureWebJobsStorage__blobServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of the blob service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net |
`AzureWebJobsStorage__queueServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of the queue service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.queue.core.windows.net |
`AzureWebJobsStorage__tableServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of a table service of the storage account, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net |

[Common properties for identity-based connections](#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections) may also be set as well.

If you're configuring `AzureWebJobsStorage`

using a storage account that uses the default DNS suffix and service name for global Azure, following the `https://<accountName>.[blob|queue|file|table].core.windows.net`

format, you can instead set `AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`

to the name of your storage account. The endpoints for each storage service are inferred for this account. This doesn't work when the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.

| Setting | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName` |
The account name of a storage account, valid only if the account isn't in a sovereign cloud and doesn't have a custom DNS. This syntax is unique to `AzureWebJobsStorage` and can't be used for other identity-based connections. |
<storage_account_name> |

You need to create a role assignment that provides access to the storage account for "AzureWebJobsStorage" at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) role covers the basic needs of Functions host storage - the runtime needs both read and write access to blobs and the ability to create containers. Several extensions use this connection as a default location for blobs, queues, and tables, and these uses may add requirements as noted in the table below. You may also need other permissions if you use "AzureWebJobsStorage" for any other purposes.

| Extension | Roles required | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
No extension (host only) |
|

This scenario represents the minimum set of permissions for normal operation, but it doesn't include support for diagnostic events

1.*No extension (host only), with support for diagnostic events*1[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)[Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor),[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor)[blob receipts](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#blob-receipts). It uses the AzureWebJobsStorage connection for these purposes, regardless of the connection configured for the trigger.[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)[Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)[Durable Functions extension configuration](durable/durable-functions-bindings#host-json).1 For some types of issues, Azure Functions can raise a diagnostic event that can assist with troubleshooting, even when the issue prevents the function app from starting. If [Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor) isn't assigned, you might see warnings in your logs about the inability to write these events.

#### Connecting to a resource in another tenant

If your function needs to connect to a resource in a different Microsoft Entra tenant, your connection needs to use a *federated identity credential*. This requires a user-assigned managed identity and a multi-tenant Entra ID app registration. You cannot use a system-assigned managed identity for cross-tenant connections.

Important

When you configure a trigger for a cross-tenant connection in the Consumption or Flex Consumption plan types, the platform no longer scales the function app based on that trigger.

To configure a cross-tenant identity-based connection, you first need to set up your infrastructure using the following steps:

- In the tenant where your function app is deployed,
[create a new user-assigned managed identity](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity). [Assign that identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json#add-a-user-assigned-identity)to the function app.- In the same tenant,
[create a multi-tenant Entra app registration](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity#configure-a-multi-tenant-app-registration)that represents the cross-tenant resource you want to access. [Add the managed identity as a federated identity credential for the app registration.](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity)- In the tenant where the resource is deployed,
[create an enterprise application for the app registration](/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/create-service-principal-cross-tenant). - Assign permissions for the enterprise application to access the resource.

A cross-tenant identity-based connection uses the following properties, where `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>`

is the value of your `connection`

property in the trigger or binding definition:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Token Credential | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__credential` |
Required. When connecting to a resource in another tenant, set this property to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` . |
| Azure Cloud | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__azureCloud` |
Required. This property determines the Azure cloud environment. Allowed values are "public" for Azure Public Cloud, "usgov" for Azure US Government Cloud, and "china" for Azure operated by 21Vianet. |
| Client ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__clientId` |
Required. When `credential` is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` , set this property to the client ID (app ID) of the app registration.This property is used differently in single-tenant identity-based connections. See the
This property is used differently in
`credential` shouldn't be set. |
| Tenant ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tenantId` |
Required. When `credential` is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` , set this property to the tenant ID of the resource tenant.This property is used differently in
`credential` shouldn't be set. |
| Managed Identity Client ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__managedIdentityClientId` |
When `credential` is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` , this property specifies the user-assigned identity that you configured as a federated identity credential and assigned to the application.1 The property accepts a client ID corresponding to that user-assigned identity. |
| Managed Identity Object ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__managedIdentityObjectId` |
When `credential` is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` , this property specifies the user-assigned identity that you configured as a federated identity credential and assigned to the application.1 The property accepts an object ID (principal ID) corresponding to that user-assigned identity. |
| Managed Identity Resource ID | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__managedIdentityResourceId` |
When `credential` is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity` , this property specifies the user-assigned identity that you configured as a federated identity credential and assigned to the application.1 The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to that user-assigned identity. |

1 When `credential`

is set to `managedidentityasfederatedidentity`

, your connection must specify exactly one of `managedIdentityClientId`

, `managedIdentityObjectId`

, or `managedIdentityResourceId`

.

This is also [documented by the Azure SDK](/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/create-token-credentials-from-configuration?tabs=client-id#managed-identity-as-a-federated-identity-credential) in a JSON format.

A function app runs on a specific version of the Azure Functions runtime. By default, function apps are created in the latest 4.x version of the Functions runtime. Your function apps are supported only when they run on a [supported major version](functions-versions). This article explains how to configure a function app in Azure to target, or *pin* to, a specific version when required.

The way that you target a specific version depends on whether you're running Windows or Linux. This version of the article supports Windows. Choose your operating system at the top of the article.

The way that you target a specific version depends on whether you're running Windows or Linux. This version of the article supports Linux. Choose your operating system at the top of the article.

Important

When possible, always run your functions on the latest supported version of the Azure Functions runtime. You should only pin your app to a specific version if you're instructed to do so due to an issue with the latest version. Always move up to the latest runtime version as soon as your functions can run correctly.

During local development, your installed version of Azure Functions Core Tools must match the major runtime version used by the function app in Azure. For more information, see [Core Tools versions](functions-run-local#v2).

## Update your runtime version

When possible, you should always run your function apps on the latest supported version of the Azure Functions runtime. If your function app is currently running on an older version of the runtime, you should migrate your app to version 4.x

When your app has existing functions, you must take precautions before moving to a later major runtime version. The following articles detail breaking changes between major versions, including language-specific breaking changes. They also provide you with step-by-step instructions for a successful migration of your existing function app.

To determine your current runtime version, see [View the current runtime version](#view-the-current-runtime-version).

## View the current runtime version

You can view the current runtime version of your function app in one of these ways:

To view and update the runtime version currently used by a function app, follow these steps:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to your function app.Expand

**Settings**, and then select**Configuration**.In the

**Function runtime settings**tab, note the**Runtime version**. In this example, the version is set to`~4`

.

## Pin to a specific version

Azure Functions lets you use the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

app setting to target the runtime version used by a given function app. If you specify only the major version (`~4`

), the function app is automatically updated to new minor versions of the runtime as they become available. Minor version updates are done automatically because new minor versions aren't likely to introduce changes that would break your functions.

Linux apps use the [ linuxFxVersion site setting](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion) along with

`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

to determine the correct Linux base image in which to run your functions. When you create a new function app on Linux, the runtime automatically chooses the correct base image for you based on the runtime version of your language stack.Pinning to a specific runtime version causes your function app to restart.

When you specify a specific minor version (such as `4.0.12345`

) in `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

, the function app is pinned to that specific version of the runtime until you explicitly choose to move back to automatic version updates. You should only pin to a specific minor version long enough to resolve any issues with your function app that prevent you from targeting the major version. Older minor versions are regularly removed from the production environment. When your function app is pinned to a minor version that is later removed, your function app is instead run on the closest existing version instead of the version set in `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

. Minor version removals are announced in [App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

Note

When you try to publish from Visual Studio to an app that is pinned to a specific minor version of the runtime, a dialog prompts you to update to the latest version or cancel the publish. To avoid this check when you must use a specific minor version, add the `<DisableFunctionExtensionVersionUpdate>true</DisableFunctionExtensionVersionUpdate>`

property in your `.csproj`

file.

Use one of these methods to temporarily pin your app to a specific version of the runtime:

To view and update the runtime version currently used by a function app, follow these steps:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to your function app.Expand

**Settings**, and then select**Configuration**.In the

**Function runtime settings**tab, note the**Runtime version**. In this example, the version is set to`~4`

.

To pin your app to a specific minor version, in the left pane, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.From the

**App settings**tab, select**FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION**, change**Value**to your required minor version, and then select**Apply**.Select

**Apply**, and then select**Confirm**to apply the changes and restart the app.

The function app restarts after the change is made to the application setting.

To pin your function app to a specific runtime version on Linux, you set a version-specific base image URL in the [ linuxFxVersion site setting](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion) in the format

`DOCKER|<PINNED_VERSION_IMAGE_URI>`

.Important

Pinned function apps on Linux don't receive regular security and host functionality updates. Unless recommended by a support professional, use the [ FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION](functions-app-settings#functions_extension_version) setting and a standard

[value for your language and version, such as](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion)

`linuxFxVersion`

`Python|3.12`

. For valid values, see the [.](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion)

`linuxFxVersion`

reference articlePinning to a specific runtime isn't currently supported for Linux function apps running in a Consumption plan.

The following example shows the [ linuxFxVersion](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion) value required to pin a Node.js 16 function app to a specific runtime version of 4.14.0.3:

`DOCKER|mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/node:4.14.0.3-node16`


When needed, a support professional can provide you with a valid base image URI for your application.

Use the following Azure CLI commands to view and set the [ linuxFxVersion](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion). You can't currently set

[in the portal or by using Azure PowerShell:](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion)

`linuxFxVersion`

To view the current runtime version, use the

[az functionapp config show](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config)command:`az functionapp config show --name <function_app> \ --resource-group <my_resource_group> --query 'linuxFxVersion' -o tsv`

In this code, replace

`<function_app>`

with the name of your function app. Also, replace`<my_resource_group>`

with the name of the resource group for your function app. The current value ofis returned.`linuxFxVersion`

To update the

setting in the function app, use the`linuxFxVersion`

[az functionapp config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config)command:`az functionapp config set --name <FUNCTION_APP> \ --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> \ --linux-fx-version <LINUX_FX_VERSION>`

Replace

`<FUNCTION_APP>`

with the name of your function app. Also, replace`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

with the name of the resource group for your function app. Finally, replace`<LINUX_FX_VERSION>`

with the value of a specific image provided to you by a support professional.

You can run these commands from the [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview) by choosing **Open Cloud Shell** in the preceding code examples. You can also use the [Azure CLI locally](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to execute this command after executing [ az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) to sign in.

The function app restarts after the change is made to the site config.

# Work with legacy proxies

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

To help make it easier to migrate from existing proxy implementations, this article links to equivalent API Management content, when available.


This article explains how to configure and work with Azure Functions Proxies. With this feature, you can specify endpoints on your function app that are implemented by another resource. You can use these proxies to break a large API into multiple function apps (as in a microservice architecture), while still presenting a single API surface for clients.

Standard Functions billing applies to proxy executions. For more information, see [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).

## Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x

After [migrating your function app to version 4.x of the Functions runtime](migrate-version-3-version-4), you'll need to specifically reenable proxies. You should still switch to integrating your function apps with [Azure API Management](functions-proxies#api-management-integration) as soon as possible, and not just rely on proxies.

Re-enabling proxies requires you to set a flag in the `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`

application setting in one of the following ways:

If the

`AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`

setting doesn't already exists, add this setting to your function app with a value of`EnableProxies`

.If this setting already exists, add

`,EnableProxies`

to the end of the existing value.

[ AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsfeatureflags) is a comma-delimited array of flags used to enable preview and other temporary features. To learn more about how to create and modify application settings, see

[Work with application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings).

Note

Even when re-enabled using the `EnableProxies`

flag, you can't work with proxies in the Azure portal. Instead, you must work directly with the *proxies.json* file for your function app. For more information, see [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration).

## Create a proxy

Important

For equivalent content using API Management, see [Expose serverless APIs from HTTP endpoints using Azure API Management](functions-openapi-definition).

Proxies are defined in the *proxies.json* file in the root of your function app. The steps in this section show you how to use the Azure portal to create this file in your function app. Not all languages and operating system combinations support in-portal editing. If you can't modify your function app files in the portal, you can instead create and deploy the equivalent `proxies.json`

file from the root of your local project folder. To learn more about portal editing support, see [Language support details](supported-languages#language-support-details).

- Open the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then go to your function app. - In the left pane, select
**Proxies**and then select**+Add**. - Provide a name for your proxy.
- Configure the endpoint that's exposed on this function app by specifying the
**route template**and**HTTP methods**. These parameters behave according to the rules for[HTTP triggers](functions-bindings-http-webhook). - Set the
**backend URL**to another endpoint. This endpoint could be a function in another function app, or it could be any other API. The value doesn't need to be static, and it can reference[application settings](#use-appsettings)and[parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters). - Select
**Create**.

Your proxy now exists as a new endpoint on your function app. From a client perspective, it's the same as an HttpTrigger in Functions. You can try out your new proxy by copying the **Proxy URL** and testing it with your favorite HTTP client.

## Modify requests and responses

Important

API Management lets you can change API behavior through configuration using policies. Policies are a collection of statements that are run sequentially on the request or response of an API. For more information about API Management policies, see [Policies in Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-howto-policies).

With proxies, you can modify requests to and responses from the back-end. These transformations can use variables as defined in [Use variables](#using-variables).

### Modify the back-end request

By default, the back-end request is initialized as a copy of the original request. In addition to setting the back-end URL, you can make changes to the HTTP method, headers, and query string parameters. The modified values can reference [application settings](#use-appsettings) and [parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters).

Back-end requests can be modified in the portal by expanding the *request override* section of the proxy detail page.

### Modify the response

By default, the client response is initialized as a copy of the back-end response. You can make changes to the response's status code, reason phrase, headers, and body. The modified values can reference [application settings](#use-appsettings), [parameters from the original client request](#request-parameters), and [parameters from the back-end response](#response-parameters).

Back-end responses can be modified in the portal by expanding the *response override* section of the proxy detail page.

## Use variables

The configuration for a proxy doesn't need to be static. You can condition it to use variables from the original client request, the back-end response, or application settings.

### Reference local functions

You can use `localhost`

to reference a function inside the same function app directly, without a roundtrip proxy request.

`"backendUri": "https://localhost/api/httptriggerC#1"`

will reference a local HTTP triggered function at the route `/api/httptriggerC#1`


Note

If your function uses *function, admin or sys* authorization levels, you will need to provide the code and clientId, as per the original function URL. In this case the reference would look like: `"backendUri": "https://localhost/api/httptriggerC#1?code=<keyvalue>&clientId=<keyname>"`

We recommend storing these keys in [application settings](#use-appsettings) and referencing those in your proxies. This avoids storing secrets in your source code.

### Reference request parameters

You can use request parameters as inputs to the back-end URL property or as part of modifying requests and responses. Some parameters can be bound from the route template that's specified in the base proxy configuration, and others can come from properties of the incoming request.

#### Route template parameters

Parameters that are used in the route template are available to be referenced by name. The parameter names are enclosed in braces ({}).

For example, if a proxy has a route template, such as `/pets/{petId}`

, the back-end URL can include the value of `{petId}`

, as in `https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/pets/{petId}`

. If the route template terminates in a wildcard, such as `/api/{*restOfPath}`

, the value `{restOfPath}`

is a string representation of the remaining path segments from the incoming request.

#### Additional request parameters

In addition to the route template parameters, the following values can be used in config values:

**{request.method}**: The HTTP method that's used on the original request.**{request.headers.<HeaderName>}**: A header that can be read from the original request. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to read. If the header isn't included on the request, the value will be the empty string.**{request.querystring.<ParameterName>}**: A query string parameter that can be read from the original request. Replace*<ParameterName>*with the name of the parameter that you want to read. If the parameter isn't included on the request, the value will be the empty string.

### Reference back-end response parameters

Response parameters can be used as part of modifying the response to the client. The following values can be used in config values:

**{backend.response.statusCode}**: The HTTP status code that's returned on the back-end response.**{backend.response.statusReason}**: The HTTP reason phrase that's returned on the back-end response.**{backend.response.headers.<HeaderName>}**: A header that can be read from the back-end response. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header you want to read. If the header isn't included on the response, the value will be the empty string.

### Reference application settings

You can also reference [application settings defined for the function app](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) by surrounding the setting name with percent signs (%).

For example, a back-end URL of *https://%ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST%/api/orders* would have "%ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST%" replaced with the value of the ORDER_PROCESSING_HOST setting.

Tip

Use application settings for back-end hosts when you have multiple deployments or test environments. That way, you can make sure that you are always talking to the right back-end for that environment.

## Troubleshoot Proxies

By adding the flag `"debug":true`

to any proxy in your `proxies.json`

, you'll enable debug logging. Logs are stored in `D:\home\LogFiles\Application\Proxies\DetailedTrace`

and accessible through the advanced tools (kudu). Any HTTP responses will also contain a `Proxy-Trace-Location`

header with a URL to access the log file.

You can debug a proxy from the client side by adding a `Proxy-Trace-Enabled`

header set to `true`

. This will also log a trace to the file system, and return the trace URL as a header in the response.

### Block proxy traces

For security reasons you may not want to allow anyone calling your service to generate a trace. They won't be able to access the trace contents without your sign-in credentials, but generating the trace consumes resources and exposes that you're using Function Proxies.

Disable traces altogether by adding `"debug":false`

to any particular proxy in your `proxies.json`

.

## Advanced configuration

The proxies that you configure are stored in a *proxies.json* file, which is located in the root of a function app directory. You can manually edit this file and deploy it as part of your app when you use any of the [deployment methods](functions-continuous-deployment) that Functions supports.

Tip

If you have not set up one of the deployment methods, you can also work with the *proxies.json* file in the portal. Go to your function app, select **Platform features**, and then select **App Service Editor**. By doing so, you can view the entire file structure of your function app and then make changes.

*Proxies.json* is defined by a proxies object, which is composed of named proxies and their definitions. Optionally, if your editor supports it, you can reference a [JSON schema](http://json.schemastore.org/proxies) for code completion. An example file might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>"
}
}
}
```


Each proxy has a friendly name, such as *proxy1* in the preceding example. The corresponding proxy definition object is defined by the following properties:

**matchCondition**: Required--an object defining the requests that trigger the execution of this proxy. It contains two properties that are shared with[HTTP triggers](functions-bindings-http-webhook):*methods*: An array of the HTTP methods that the proxy responds to. If it isn't specified, the proxy responds to all HTTP methods on the route.*route*: Required--defines the route template, controlling which request URLs your proxy responds to. Unlike in HTTP triggers, there's no default value.

**backendUri**: The URL of the back-end resource to which the request should be proxied. This value can reference application settings and parameters from the original client request. If this property isn't included, Azure Functions responds with an HTTP 200 OK.**requestOverrides**: An object that defines transformations to the back-end request. See[Define a requestOverrides object](#requestOverrides).**responseOverrides**: An object that defines transformations to the client response. See[Define a responseOverrides object](#responseOverrides).

Note

The *route* property in Azure Functions Proxies does not honor the *routePrefix* property of the Function App host configuration. If you want to include a prefix such as `/api`

, it must be included in the *route* property.

### Disable individual proxies

You can disable individual proxies by adding `"disabled": true`

to the proxy in the `proxies.json`

file. This will cause any requests meeting the matchCondition to return 404.

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"Root": {
"disabled":true,
"matchCondition": {
"route": "/example"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>"
}
}
}
```


### Application Settings

The proxy behavior can be controlled by several app settings. They're all outlined in the [Functions App Settings reference](functions-app-settings)

### Reserved Characters (string formatting)

Proxies read all strings out of a JSON file, using \ as an escape symbol. Proxies also interpret curly braces. See a full set of examples below.

| Character | Escaped Character | Example |
|---|---|---|
| { or } | {{ or }} | `{{ example }}` --> `{ example }` |
| \ | \\ | `example.com\\text.html` --> `example.com\text.html` |
| " | \" | `\"example\"` --> `"example"` |

### Define a requestOverrides object

The requestOverrides object defines changes made to the request when the back-end resource is called. The object is defined by the following properties:

**backend.request.method**: The HTTP method that's used to call the back-end.**backend.request.querystring.<ParameterName>**: A query string parameter that can be set for the call to the back-end. Replace*<ParameterName>*with the name of the parameter that you want to set. If an empty string is provided, the parameter is still included on the back-end request.**backend.request.headers.<HeaderName>**: A header that can be set for the call to the back-end. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to set. If an empty string is provided, the parameter is still included on the back-end request.

Values can reference application settings and parameters from the original client request.

An example configuration might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"backendUri": "https://<AnotherApp>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FunctionName>",
"requestOverrides": {
"backend.request.headers.Accept": "application/xml",
"backend.request.headers.x-functions-key": "%ANOTHERAPP_API_KEY%"
}
}
}
}
```


### Define a responseOverrides object

The requestOverrides object defines changes that are made to the response that's passed back to the client. The object is defined by the following properties:

**response.statusCode**: The HTTP status code to be returned to the client.**response.statusReason**: The HTTP reason phrase to be returned to the client.**response.body**: The string representation of the body to be returned to the client.**response.headers.<HeaderName>**: A header that can be set for the response to the client. Replace*<HeaderName>*with the name of the header that you want to set. If you provide the empty string, the header isn't included on the response.

Values can reference application settings, parameters from the original client request, and parameters from the back-end response.

An example configuration might look like the following:

```
{
"$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
"proxies": {
"proxy1": {
"matchCondition": {
"methods": [ "GET" ],
"route": "/api/{test}"
},
"responseOverrides": {
"response.body": "Hello, {test}",
"response.headers.Content-Type": "text/plain"
}
}
}
}
```


Note

In this example, the response body is set directly, so no `backendUri`

property is needed. The example shows how you might use Azure Functions Proxies for mocking APIs.
