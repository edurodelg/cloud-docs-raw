# Securing Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Service](../app-service/) provides the hosting infrastructure for your function apps. This article provides security strategies for running your function code, and how App Service can help you secure your functions.

Azure App Service actively secures and hardens its platform components, including Azure virtual machines (VMs), storage, network connections, web frameworks, and management and integration features. App Service undergoes continuous, rigorous compliance checks to ensure that:

[Each app is segregated from other Azure apps and resources](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox).[Regular updates of VMs and runtime software](/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-patch-os-runtime)address newly discovered vulnerabilities.- Communication of secrets and connection strings between apps and other Azure resources like
[Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)occurs only within Azure, without crossing any network boundaries. Stored secrets are always encrypted. - All communications over App Service connectivity features like
[Hybrid Connection](/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections)are encrypted. - All connections via remote management tools like Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure SDKs, and REST APIs are encrypted.
- Continuous threat management protects the infrastructure and platform against malware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and man-in-the-middle attacks, and other threats.

For more information on infrastructure and platform security in Azure, see the [Azure Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

For a set of security recommendations that follow the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/introduction), see [Azure Security Baseline for Azure Functions](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/functions-security-baseline).

While planning for secure development, deployment, and operation of serverless functions is much the same as for any web-based or cloud-hosted application, serverless applications are likely vulnerable to variations of traditional attacks. To learn more about potential attacks on serverless infrastructure, see the [OWASP Top 10: Serverless Interpretation](https://owasp.org/www-project-serverless-top-10/).

## Secure operation

This section guides you on configuring and running your function app as securely as possible.

### Defender for Cloud

Defender for Cloud integrates with your function app in the portal. It provides a quick assessment of potential configuration-related security vulnerabilities. Function apps running in a dedicated plan can also use Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features for an extra cost. For more information, see [Defender for App Service](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-app-service-introduction).

### Log and monitor

One way to detect attacks is through activity monitoring and logging analytics. Functions integrates with Application Insights to collect log, performance, and error data for your function app. Application Insights automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and understand how your functions are used. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

Functions also integrates with Azure Monitor Logs to enable you to consolidate function app logs with system events for easier analysis. You can use diagnostic settings to configure the streaming export of platform logs and metrics for your functions to the destination of your choice, such as a Logs Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Functions with Azure Monitor Logs](functions-monitor-log-analytics).

For enterprise-level threat detection and response automation, stream your logs and events to a Logs Analytics workspace. You can then connect Microsoft Sentinel to this workspace. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Sentinel](../sentinel/overview).

For more security recommendations for observability, see the [Azure security baseline for Azure Functions](security-baseline#logging-and-monitoring).

### Secure HTTP endpoints

HTTP endpoints that you expose publicly provide a vector of attack for malicious actors. When securing your HTTP endpoints, use a layered security approach. Use these techniques to reduce the vulnerability of publicly exposed HTTP endpoints, ordered from most basic to most secure and restrictive:

[Require HTTPS](#require-https)[Require access keys](#function-access-keys)[Enable App Service Authentication/Authorization](#enable-app-service-authenticationauthorization)[Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests](#use-azure-api-management-apim-to-authenticate-requests)[Deploy your function app to a virtual network](#deploy-your-function-app-to-a-virtual-network)[Deploy your function app in isolation](#deploy-your-function-app-in-isolation)

### Require HTTPS

By default, clients can connect to function endpoints by using either HTTP or HTTPS. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS because HTTPS uses the TLS protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated. To learn how, see [Enforce HTTPS](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-https).

When you require HTTPS, also require the latest TLS version. To learn how, see [Enforce TLS versions](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-tls-versions).

For more information, see [Secure connections (TLS)](../app-service/overview-security#https-and-certificates).

### Function access keys

Functions uses keys to make it harder to access your function endpoints. Unless you set the HTTP access level on an HTTP triggered function to `anonymous`

, requests must include an access key in the request. For more information, see [Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to).

While access keys can help prevent unwanted access, the only way to truly secure your function endpoints is by implementing positive authentication of clients accessing your functions. You can then make authorization decisions based on identity.

For the highest level of security, secure the entire application architecture inside a virtual network [using private endpoints](#deploy-your-function-app-to-a-virtual-network) or by [running in isolation](#deploy-your-function-app-in-isolation).

### Disable administrative endpoints

Function apps can serve administrative endpoints under the `/admin`

route. You can use these endpoints for operations such as obtaining host status information and performing test invocations. When exposed, requests against these endpoints must include the app's master key. You can also access administrative operations through the [Azure Resource Manager Microsoft.Web/sites API](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps), which offers Azure RBAC. To disable the

`/admin`

endpoints, set the `functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled`

site property in your app to `true`

. For more information, see the [functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled](functions-app-settings#functionsruntimeadminisolationenabled)property reference.

### Enable App Service Authentication/Authorization

The App Service platform lets you use Microsoft Entra ID and several non-Microsoft identity providers to authenticate clients. Use this strategy to implement custom authorization rules for your functions. You can work with user information from your function code. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) and [Working with client identities](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#working-with-client-identities).

### Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests

APIM provides various API security options for incoming requests. For more information, see [API Management authentication policies](../api-management/api-management-policies#authentication-and-authorization). By using APIM, you can configure your function app to accept requests only from the IP address of your APIM instance. For more information, see [IP address restrictions](ip-addresses#ip-address-restrictions).

### Permissions

As with any application or service, run your function app with the lowest possible permissions.

#### User management permissions

Functions supports built-in [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview). Azure roles supported by Functions are [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), and [Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader).

Permissions take effect at the function app level. The Contributor role is required to perform most function app-level tasks. You also need the Contributor role along with the [Monitoring Reader permission](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security#monitoring-reader) to view log data in Application Insights. Only the Owner role can delete a function app.

#### Organize functions by privilege

Connection strings and other credentials stored in application settings give all of the functions in the function app the same set of permissions in the associated resource. Consider minimizing the number of functions with access to specific credentials by moving functions that don't use those credentials to a separate function app. You can always use techniques such as [function chaining](/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/) to pass data between functions in different function apps.

#### Managed identities

A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows your app to easily access other Microsoft Entra-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. The Azure platform manages the identity, so you don't need to provision or rotate any secrets. For more information about managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

You can grant two types of identities to your application:

- A
*system-assigned identity*is tied to the app and is deleted if the app is deleted. An app can have only one system-assigned identity. - A
*user-assigned identity*is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your app. An app can have multiple user-assigned identities. One user-assigned identity can be assigned to multiple Azure resources, such as two App Service apps.

Use managed identities instead of secrets for connections from some triggers and bindings. See [Identity-based connections](#identity-based-connections).

For more information, see [Use managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

#### Restrict CORS access

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is a way to allow web apps running in another domain to make requests to your HTTP trigger endpoints. App Service provides built-in support for handling the required CORS headers in HTTP requests. CORS rules are defined on a function app level.

It's tempting to use a wildcard that allows all sites to access your endpoint. This approach defeats the purpose of CORS, which is to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Instead, add a separate CORS entry for the domain of each web app that must access your endpoint.

### Managing secrets

To connect to the various services and resources needed to run your code, function apps need access to secrets, such as connection strings and service keys. This section describes how to store secrets required by your functions.

Never store secrets in your function code.

#### Application settings

By default, store connection strings and secrets used by your function app and bindings as application settings. This approach makes these credentials available to both your function code and the various bindings used by the function. Use the application setting (key) name to retrieve the actual value, which is the secret.

For example, every function app requires an associated storage account, which the runtime uses. By default, you store the connection to this storage account in an application setting named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

Azure encrypts app settings and connection strings. The app settings and connection strings are decrypted only before being injected into your app's process memory when the app starts. The encryption keys are rotated regularly. If you prefer to manage the secure storage of your secrets, make the app settings references to Azure Key Vault secrets.

When developing functions on your local computer, you can also encrypt settings by default in the `local.settings.json`

file. For more information, see [Encrypt the local settings file](functions-run-local#encrypt-the-local-settings-file).

#### Key Vault references

While application settings are sufficient for most functions, you might want to share the same secrets across multiple services. In this case, redundant storage of secrets results in more potential vulnerabilities. A more secure approach is to use a central secret storage service and use references to this service instead of the secrets themselves.

[Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history. You can use a Key Vault reference in the place of a connection string or key in your application settings. For more information, see [Use Key Vault references for App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

### Identity-based connections

Use identities in place of secrets for connecting to some resources. This approach has the advantage of not requiring the management of a secret, and it provides more fine-grained access control and auditing.

When you write code that creates the connection to [Azure services that support Microsoft Entra authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities#services-supporting-managed-identities), you can use an identity instead of a secret or connection string. Details for both connection methods are covered in the documentation for each service.

You can configure some Azure Functions binding extensions to access services by using identity-based connections. For more information, see [Configure an identity-based connection](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

### Set usage quotas

Consider setting a usage quota for functions running in a Consumption plan. When you set a daily GB-sec limit on the total execution of functions in your function app, execution stops when the limit is reached. This approach could potentially help protect against malicious code executing your functions. To learn how to estimate consumption for your functions, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

### Data validation

The triggers and bindings used by your functions don't provide any extra data validation. Your code must validate any data received from a trigger or input binding. If an upstream service is compromised, you don't want unvalidated inputs flowing through your functions. For example, if your function stores data from an Azure Storage queue in a relational database, you must validate the data and parameterize your commands to avoid SQL injection attacks.

Don't assume that the data coming into your function is already validated or sanitized. It's also a good idea to verify that the data being written to output bindings is valid.

### Handle errors

While it seems basic, it's important to write good error handling in your functions. Unhandled errors bubble up to the host, and the runtime handles these errors. Different bindings handle the processing of errors differently. For more information, see [Azure Functions error handling](functions-bindings-error-pages).

### Disable remote debugging

Make sure that remote debugging is disabled, except when you're actively debugging your functions. You can disable remote debugging in the **General Settings** tab of your function app **Configuration** in the portal.

### Restrict CORS access

Azure Functions supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). CORS is configured [in the portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#cors) and through the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/cors). The CORS allowed origins list applies at the function app level. With CORS enabled, responses include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header. For more information, see [Cross-origin resource sharing](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#cors).

Don't use wildcards in your allowed origins list. Instead, list the specific domains from which you expect to get requests.

### Store data encrypted

Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. For more information, see [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption).

By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For more control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys to use for encryption of blob and file data. These keys must be present in Azure Key Vault for Functions to be able to access the storage account. To learn more, see [Encrypt your application data at rest using customer-managed keys](configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk).

### Secure related resources

A function app frequently depends on other resources, so part of securing the app is securing these external resources. At a minimum, most function apps include a dependency on Application Insights and Azure Storage. For guidance on securing these resources, consult the [Azure security baseline for Azure Monitor](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-monitor-security-baseline) and the [Azure security baseline for Storage](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/storage-security-baseline).

Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

You should also consult the guidance for any resource types your application logic depends on, both as triggers and bindings and from your function code.

## Secure deployment

Azure Functions tooling integration makes it easy to publish local function project code to Azure. It's important to understand how deployment works when considering security for an Azure Functions topology.

### Deployment credentials

App Service deployments require a set of deployment credentials. You use these deployment credentials to secure your function app deployments. The App Service platform manages deployment credentials and encrypts them at rest.

There are two kinds of deployment credentials:

**User-scope**or user-level credentials provide one set of deployment credentials for a user's entire Azure account. A user who is granted app access via role-based access control (RBAC) or coadministrator permissions can use their user-level credentials as long as they have those permissions.You can use your user-scope credentials to deploy any app to App Service via local Git or FTP/S in any subscription that your Azure account has permission to access. You don't share these credentials with any other Azure users. You can reset your user-scope credentials anytime.

**App-scope**or application-level credentials are one set of credentials per app that can be used to deploy that app only. These credentials are generated automatically for each app at creation and can't be configured manually, but the password can be reset anytime.A user must have at least

**Contributor**level permissions on an app, including the built-in**Website Contributor**role, to be granted access to app-level credentials via RBAC.**Reader**role can't publish and can't access these credentials.

At this time, Key Vault isn't supported for deployment credentials. To learn more about managing deployment credentials, see [Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service](../app-service/deploy-configure-credentials).

### Disable FTP

By default, each function app has an FTP endpoint enabled. The FTP endpoint is accessed using deployment credentials.

FTP isn't recommended for deploying your function code. FTP deployments are manual, and they require you to synchronize triggers. For more information, see [FTP deployment](functions-deployment-technologies#ftps).

When you're not using FTP, keep it disabled. You can change this setting in the portal. If you do choose to use FTP, [enforce FTPS](../app-service/deploy-ftp#enforce-ftps).

### Secure the `scm`

endpoint

Each function app has a corresponding `scm`

service endpoint that the Advanced Tools (Kudu) service uses for deployments and other App Service [site extensions](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Site-Extensions). The `scm`

endpoint for a function app is always a URL in the form `https://<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.scm.azurewebsites.net`

. When you use network isolation to secure your functions, you must also account for this endpoint.

By using a separate `scm`

endpoint, you can control deployments and other Advanced Tools functionalities for function apps that are isolated or running in a virtual network. The `scm`

endpoint supports both basic authentication (by using deployment credentials) and single sign-on with your Azure portal credentials. For more information, see [Accessing the Kudu service](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service).

### Continuous security validation

Because you need to consider security at every step in the development process, it makes sense to also implement security validations in a continuous deployment environment. This approach is sometimes called *DevSecOps*. By using Azure DevOps for your deployment pipeline, you can integrate validation into the deployment process. For more information, see [Secure your Azure Pipelines](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/security/overview).

## Network security

By restricting network access to your function app, you can control who can access your functions endpoints. Functions uses App Service infrastructure to enable your functions to access resources without using internet-routable addresses or to restrict internet access to a function endpoint. To learn more about these networking options, see [Azure Functions networking options](functions-networking-options).

### Set access restrictions

Access restrictions allow you to define lists of allow and deny rules to control traffic to your app. Rules are evaluated in priority order. If you don't define any rules, your app accepts traffic from any address. For more information, see [Azure App Service access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

### Secure the storage account

When you create a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. You can replace this storage account with one that is secured by a virtual network with access enabled by service endpoints or private endpoints. For more information, see [Restrict your storage account to a virtual network](functions-networking-options#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Deploy your function app to a virtual network

[Azure Private Endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview) is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network.

You can use Private Endpoint for your functions hosted in the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans.

If you want to make calls to Private Endpoints, then you must make sure that your DNS lookups resolve to the private endpoint. You can enforce this behavior in one of the following ways:

- Integrate with Azure DNS private zones. When your virtual network doesn't have a custom DNS server, this is done automatically.
- Manage the private endpoint in the DNS server used by your app. To manage a private endpoint, you must know the endpoint address and use an A record to reference the endpoint you're trying to reach.
- Configure your own DNS server to forward to
[Azure DNS private zones](../dns/private-dns-privatednszone).

To learn more, see [using Private Endpoints for Web Apps](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

### Deploy your function app in isolation

Azure App Service Environment provides a dedicated hosting environment in which to run your functions. These environments let you configure a single front-end gateway that you can use to authenticate all incoming requests. For more information, see [Integrate your ILB App Service Environment with the Azure Application Gateway](../app-service/environment/integrate-with-application-gateway).

### Use a gateway service

By using gateway services such as [Azure Application Gateway](../application-gateway/overview) and [Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-overview), you can set up a Web Application Firewall (WAF). WAF rules monitor or block detected attacks, which provides an extra layer of protection for your functions. To set up a WAF, your function app needs to run in an ASE or use Private Endpoints (preview). For more information, see [Using private endpoints](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

# Azure SQL output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure SQL output binding lets you write to a database.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-azure-sql).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

## Examples

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

More samples for the Azure SQL output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-outofproc).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a `ToDoItem`

class and a corresponding database table:

```
namespace AzureSQL.ToDo
{
public class ToDoItem
{
public Guid Id { get; set; }
public int? order { get; set; }
public string title { get; set; }
public string url { get; set; }
public bool? completed { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
CREATE TABLE dbo.ToDo (
[Id] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
[order] INT NULL,
[title] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
[url] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
[completed] BIT NOT NULL
);
```


To return [multiple output bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#multiple-output-bindings) in our samples, we create a custom return type:

```
public static class OutputType
{
[SqlOutput("dbo.ToDo", connectionStringSetting: "SqlConnectionString")]
public static ToDoItem ToDoItem { get; set; }
public static HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write one record

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a record to a database, using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body. The return object is the `OutputType`

class we created to handle both an HTTP response and the SQL output binding.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Sql;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
namespace AzureSQL.ToDo
{
public static class PostToDo
{
// create a new ToDoItem from body object
// uses output binding to insert new item into ToDo table
[FunctionName("PostToDo")]
public static async Task<OutputType> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "PostFunction")] HttpRequestData req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
var logger = executionContext.GetLogger("PostToDo");
logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
ToDoItem toDoItem = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ToDoItem>(requestBody);
// generate a new id for the todo item
toDoItem.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
// set Url from env variable ToDoUri
toDoItem.url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ToDoUri")+"?id="+toDoItem.Id.ToString();
// if completed is not provided, default to false
if (toDoItem.completed == null)
{
toDoItem.completed = false;
}
return new OutputType()
{
ToDoItem = toDoItem,
HttpResponse = req.CreateResponse(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
}
}
}
public static class OutputType
{
[SqlOutput("dbo.ToDo", connectionStringSetting: "SqlConnectionString")]
public ToDoItem ToDoItem { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds records to a database in two different tables (`dbo.ToDo`

and `dbo.RequestLog`

), using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings.

```
CREATE TABLE dbo.RequestLog (
Id int identity(1,1) primary key,
RequestTimeStamp datetime2 not null,
ItemCount int not null
)
```


To use an extra output binding, we add a class for `RequestLog`

and modify our `OutputType`

class:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Sql;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
namespace AzureSQL.ToDo
{
public static class PostToDo
{
// create a new ToDoItem from body object
// uses output binding to insert new item into ToDo table
[FunctionName("PostToDo")]
public static async Task<OutputType> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "PostFunction")] HttpRequestData req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
ToDoItem toDoItem = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ToDoItem>(requestBody);
// generate a new id for the todo item
toDoItem.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
// set Url from env variable ToDoUri
toDoItem.url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ToDoUri")+"?id="+toDoItem.Id.ToString();
// if completed is not provided, default to false
if (toDoItem.completed == null)
{
toDoItem.completed = false;
}
requestLog = new RequestLog();
requestLog.RequestTimeStamp = DateTime.Now;
requestLog.ItemCount = 1;
return new OutputType()
{
ToDoItem = toDoItem,
RequestLog = requestLog,
HttpResponse = req.CreateResponse(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
}
}
}
public class RequestLog {
public DateTime RequestTimeStamp { get; set; }
public int ItemCount { get; set; }
}
public static class OutputType
{
[SqlOutput("dbo.ToDo", connectionStringSetting: "SqlConnectionString")]
public ToDoItem ToDoItem { get; set; }
[SqlOutput("dbo.RequestLog", connectionStringSetting: "SqlConnectionString")]
public RequestLog RequestLog { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
}
```


More samples for the Azure SQL output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-java).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a `ToDoItem`

class (in a separate file `ToDoItem.java`

) and a corresponding database table:

```
package com.function;
import java.util.UUID;
public class ToDoItem {
public UUID Id;
public int order;
public String title;
public String url;
public boolean completed;
public ToDoItem() {
}
public ToDoItem(UUID Id, int order, String title, String url, boolean completed) {
this.Id = Id;
this.order = order;
this.title = title;
this.url = url;
this.completed = completed;
}
}
```


```
CREATE TABLE dbo.ToDo (
[Id] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
[order] INT NULL,
[title] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
[url] NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
[completed] BIT NOT NULL
);

### HTTP trigger, write a record to a table

The following example shows a SQL output binding in a Java function that adds a record to a table, using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body. The function takes another dependency on the [com.google.code.gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
<version>2.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```


```
package com.function;
import java.util.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.sql.annotation.SQLOutput;
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import java.util.Optional;
public class PostToDo {
@FunctionName("PostToDo")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@SQLOutput(
name = "toDoItem",
commandText = "dbo.ToDo",
connectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")
OutputBinding<ToDoItem> output) {
String json = request.getBody().get();
Gson gson = new Gson();
ToDoItem newToDo = gson.fromJson(json, ToDoItem.class);
newToDo.Id = UUID.randomUUID();
output.setValue(newToDo);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.CREATED).header("Content-Type", "application/json").body(output).build();
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows a SQL output binding in a JavaS function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`dbo.ToDo`

and `dbo.RequestLog`

), using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The function takes another dependency on the [com.google.code.gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
<version>2.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```


The second table, `dbo.RequestLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
CREATE TABLE dbo.RequestLog (
Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
RequestTimeStamp DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT(GETDATE()),
ItemCount INT NOT NULL
)
```


and Java class in `RequestLog.java`

:

```
package com.function;
import java.util.Date;
public class RequestLog {
public int Id;
public Date RequestTimeStamp;
public int ItemCount;
public RequestLog() {
}
public RequestLog(int Id, Date RequestTimeStamp, int ItemCount) {
this.Id = Id;
this.RequestTimeStamp = RequestTimeStamp;
this.ItemCount = ItemCount;
}
}
```


```
package com.function;
import java.util.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.sql.annotation.SQLOutput;
import com.google.gson.Gson;
import java.util.Optional;
public class PostToDoWithLog {
@FunctionName("PostToDoWithLog")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@SQLOutput(
name = "toDoItem",
commandText = "dbo.ToDo",
connectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")
OutputBinding<ToDoItem> output,
@SQLOutput(
name = "requestLog",
commandText = "dbo.RequestLog",
connectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")
OutputBinding<RequestLog> outputLog,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
String json = request.getBody().get();
Gson gson = new Gson();
ToDoItem newToDo = gson.fromJson(json, ToDoItem.class);
newToDo.Id = UUID.randomUUID();
output.setValue(newToDo);
RequestLog newLog = new RequestLog();
newLog.ItemCount = 1;
outputLog.setValue(newLog);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.CREATED).header("Content-Type", "application/json").body(output).build();
}
}
```

```


### HTTP trigger, write records to a table

The following example shows a SQL output binding in a function.json file and a PowerShell function that adds records to a table, using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

The following is binding data in the function.json file:

```
{
"authLevel": "anonymous",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "req",
"methods": [
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",

### HTTP trigger, write records to a table

The following example shows a SQL output binding in a function.json file and a Python function that adds records to a table, using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

The following is sample python code for the function_app.py file:

```
import json
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="AddToDo")
@app.route(route="addtodo")
@app.sql_output(arg_name="todo",
command_text="[dbo].[ToDo]",
connection_string_setting="SqlConnectionString")
def add_todo(req: func.HttpRequest, todo: func.Out[func.SqlRow]) -> func.HttpResponse:
body = json.loads(req.get_body())
row = func.SqlRow.from_dict(body)
todo.set(row)
return func.HttpResponse(
body=req.get_body(),
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows a SQL output binding in a function.json file and a Python function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`dbo.ToDo`

and `dbo.RequestLog`

), using data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings.

The second table, `dbo.RequestLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
CREATE TABLE dbo.RequestLog (
Id int identity(1,1) primary key,
RequestTimeStamp datetime2 not null,
ItemCount int not null
)
```


The following is sample python code for the function_app.py file:

```
from datetime import datetime
import json
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="PostToDo")
@app.route(route="posttodo")
@app.sql_output(arg_name="todoItems",
command_text="[dbo].[ToDo]",
connection_string_setting="SqlConnectionString")
@app.sql_output(arg_name="requestLog",
command_text="[dbo].[RequestLog]",
connection_string_setting="SqlConnectionString")
def add_todo(req: func.HttpRequest, todoItems: func.Out[func.SqlRow], requestLog: func.Out[func.SqlRow]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger and SQL output binding function processed a request.')
try:
req_body = req.get_json()
rows = func.SqlRowList(map(lambda r: func.SqlRow.from_dict(r), req_body))
except ValueError:
pass
requestLog.set(func.SqlRow({
"RequestTimeStamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
"ItemCount": 1
}))
if req_body:
todoItems.set(rows)
return func.HttpResponse(
"OK",
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
else:
return func.HttpResponse(
"Error accessing request body",
status_code=400
)
```


## Attributes

The [C# library](functions-dotnet-class-library) uses the [SqlAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/main/src/SqlAttribute.cs) attribute to declare the SQL bindings on the function, which has the following properties:

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
CommandText |
Required. The name of the table being written to by the binding. |
ConnectionStringSetting |
Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database to which data is being written. This value isn't the actual connection string and must instead resolve to an environment variable. |

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@SQLOutput`

annotation (`com.microsoft.azure.functions.sql.annotation.SQLOutput`

) on parameters whose value would come from Azure SQL. This annotation supports the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
commandText |
Required. The name of the table being written to by the binding. |
connectionStringSetting |
Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database to which data is being written. This value isn't the actual connection string and must instead resolve to an environment variable. |
name |
Required. The unique name of the function binding. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.sql()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
commandText |
Required. The name of the table being written to by the binding. |
connectionStringSetting |
Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database to which data is being written. This value isn't the actual connection string and must instead resolve to an environment variable. Optional keywords in the connection string value are
|

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Required. Must be set to `sql` . |
direction |
Required. Must be set to `out` . |
name |
Required. The name of the variable that represents the entity in function code. |
commandText |
Required. The name of the table being written to by the binding. |
connectionStringSetting |
Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database to which data is being written. This value isn't the actual connection string and must instead resolve to an environment variable. Optional keywords in the connection string value are
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The `CommandText`

property is the name of the table where the data is to be stored. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting that contains the [connection string](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.0&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString) to the Azure SQL or SQL Server instance.

Important

For optimal security, you should use Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities for connections between Functions and Azure SQL Database. Managed identities make your app more secure by eliminating secrets from your application deployments, such as credentials in the connection strings, server names, and ports being used. You can learn how to use managed identities in this tutorial, [Connect a function app to Azure SQL with managed identity and SQL bindings](functions-identity-access-azure-sql-with-managed-identity).

The output bindings use the T-SQL [MERGE](/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql) statement which requires [SELECT](/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql#permissions) permissions on the target database.

If an exception occurs when a SQL output binding is executed, then the function code stops executing. This behavior may result in an error code being returned, such as an HTTP trigger returning a 500 error code. If the `IAsyncCollector`

is used in a .NET function, then the function code can handle exceptions throw by the call to `FlushAsync()`

.

# Quickstart: Create and deploy Azure Functions resources from Terraform

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you use Terraform to create a function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions, along with other required Azure resources. The Flex Consumption plan provides serverless hosting that lets you run your code on demand without explicitly provisioning or managing infrastructure. The function app runs on Linux and is configured to use Azure Blob storage for code deployments.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) enables the definition, preview, and deployment of cloud infrastructure. Using Terraform, you create configuration files using [HCL syntax](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration). The HCL syntax allows you to specify the cloud provider - such as Azure - and the elements that make up your cloud infrastructure. After you create your configuration files, you create an *execution plan* that allows you to preview your infrastructure changes before they're deployed. Once you verify the changes, you apply the execution plan to deploy the infrastructure.

- Create an Azure resource group with a unique name.
- Generate a random string of 13 lowercase letters to name resources.
- Create a storage account in Azure.
- Create a blob storage container in the storage account.
- Create a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.
- Create a function app with a Flex Consumption plan in Azure.
- Output the names of the resource group, storage account, service plan, function app, and Azure Functions Flex Consumption plan.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. You can
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). [Install and configure Terraform](/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)to obtain the subscription ID or run in[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

## Implement the Terraform code

The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-azure-functions). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-azure-functions/TestRecord.md). See more [articles and sample code showing how to use Terraform to manage Azure resources](/en-us/azure/terraform).

Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code, and make it the current directory.

Create a file named

`main.tf`

, and insert the following code:`# This Terraform configuration creates a Flex Consumption plan app in Azure Functions # with the required Storage account and Blob Storage deployment container. # Create a random pet to generate a unique resource group name resource "random_pet" "rg_name" { prefix = var.resource_group_name_prefix } # Create a resource group resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" { location = var.resource_group_location name = random_pet.rg_name.id } # Random String for unique naming of resources resource "random_string" "name" { length = 8 special = false upper = false lower = true numeric = false } # Create a storage account resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" { name = coalesce(var.sa_name, random_string.name.result) resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location account_tier = var.sa_account_tier account_replication_type = var.sa_account_replication_type } # Create a storage container resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" { name = "example-flexcontainer" storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id container_access_type = "private" } # Create a Log Analytics workspace for Application Insights resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "example" { name = coalesce(var.ws_name, random_string.name.result) location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name sku = "PerGB2018" retention_in_days = 30 } # Create an Application Insights instance for monitoring resource "azurerm_application_insights" "example" { name = coalesce(var.ai_name, random_string.name.result) location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name application_type = "web" workspace_id = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.example.id } # Create a service plan resource "azurerm_service_plan" "example" { name = coalesce(var.asp_name, random_string.name.result) resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location sku_name = "FC1" os_type = "Linux" } # Create a function app resource "azurerm_function_app_flex_consumption" "example" { name = coalesce(var.fa_name, random_string.name.result) resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name location = azurerm_resource_group.example.location service_plan_id = azurerm_service_plan.example.id storage_container_type = "blobContainer" storage_container_endpoint = "${azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_blob_endpoint}${azurerm_storage_container.example.name}" storage_authentication_type = "StorageAccountConnectionString" storage_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key runtime_name = var.runtime_name runtime_version = var.runtime_version maximum_instance_count = 50 instance_memory_in_mb = 2048 site_config { } }`

Create a file named

`outputs.tf`

, and insert the following code:`output "resource_group_name" { value = azurerm_resource_group.example.name } output "sa_name" { value = azurerm_storage_account.example.name } output "asp_name" { value = azurerm_service_plan.example.name } output "fa_name" { value = azurerm_function_app_flex_consumption.example.name } output "fa_url" { value = "https://${azurerm_function_app_flex_consumption.example.name}.azurewebsites.net" }`

Create a file named

`providers.tf`

, and insert the following code:`terraform { required_version = ">=1.0" required_providers { azurerm = { source = "hashicorp/azurerm" version = "~>4.0" } random = { source = "hashicorp/random" version = "~>3.0" } } } provider "azurerm" { features {} }`

Create a file named

`variables.tf`

, and insert the following code:`variable "resource_group_name" { type = string default = "" description = "The name of the Azure resource group. If blank, a random name will be generated." } variable "resource_group_name_prefix" { type = string default = "rg" description = "Prefix of the resource group name that's combined with a random ID so name is unique in your Azure subscription." } variable "resource_group_location" { type = string default = "eastus" description = "Location of the resource group." } variable "sa_account_tier" { description = "The tier of the storage account. Possible values are Standard and Premium." type = string default = "Standard" } variable "sa_account_replication_type" { description = "The replication type of the storage account. Possible values are LRS, GRS, RAGRS, and ZRS." type = string default = "LRS" } variable "sa_name" { description = "The name of the storage account. If blank, a random name will be generated." type = string default = "" } variable "ws_name" { description = "The name of the Log Analytics workspace.

Use this Azure CLI command to set the

`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

environment variable to the ID of your current subscription:`export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query "id" --output tsv)`

You must have this variable set for Terraform to be able to authenticate to your Azure subscription.


## Initialize Terraform

Run [terraform init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command downloads the Azure provider required to manage your Azure resources.

```
terraform init -upgrade
```


**Key points:**

- The
`-upgrade`

parameter upgrades the necessary provider plugins to the newest version that complies with the configuration's version constraints.

## Create a Terraform execution plan

Run [terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html) to create an execution plan.

```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="runtime_name=dotnet-isolated" -var="runtime_version=8"
```


```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="runtime_name=powershell" -var="runtime_version=7.4"
```


```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="runtime_name=python" -var="runtime_version=3.12"
```


```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="runtime_name=java" -var="runtime_version=21"
```


```
terraform plan -out main.tfplan -var="runtime_name=node" -var="runtime_version=20"
```


Make sure that `runtime_version`

matches the language stack version you verified locally. Select your preferred language stack at the [top](#top) of the article.

**Key points:**

- The
`terraform plan`

command creates an execution plan, but doesn't execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources. - The optional
`-out`

parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the`-out`

parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

Run [terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html) to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure.

```
terraform apply main.tfplan
```


**Key points:**

- The example
`terraform apply`

command assumes you previously ran`terraform plan -out main.tfplan`

. - If you specified a different filename for the
`-out`

parameter, use that same filename in the call to`terraform apply`

. - If you didn't use the
`-out`

parameter, call`terraform apply`

without any parameters.

## Verify the results

The `outputs.tf`

file returns these values for your new function app:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
`resource_group_name` |
The name of the resource group you created. |
`sa_name` |
The name of the Azure storage account required by the Functions host. |
`asp_name` |
The name of the Flex Consumption plan that hosts your new app. |
`fa_name` |
The name of your new function app. |
`fa_url` |
The URL of your new function app endpoint. |

Open a browser and browse to the URL location in `fa_url`

. You can also use the [terraform output](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/output) command to review these values at a later time.


## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources created via Terraform, do the following steps:

Run

[terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)and specify the`destroy`

flag.`terraform plan -destroy -out main.destroy.tfplan`

**Key points:**- The
`terraform plan`

command creates an execution plan, but doesn't execute it. Instead, it determines what actions are necessary to create the configuration specified in your configuration files. This pattern allows you to verify whether the execution plan matches your expectations before making any changes to actual resources. - The optional
`-out`

parameter allows you to specify an output file for the plan. Using the`-out`

parameter ensures that the plan you reviewed is exactly what is applied.

- The
Run

[terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html)to apply the execution plan.`terraform apply main.destroy.tfplan`


## Troubleshoot Terraform on Azure

[Troubleshoot common problems when using Terraform on Azure](/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/troubleshoot).

## Next steps

You can now deploy a code project to the function app resources you created in Azure.

# Web PubSub bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to authenticate, send real-time messages to clients connected to [Azure Web PubSub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/web-pubsub/) by using Azure Web PubSub bindings in Azure Functions.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Handle client events from Web PubSub |
|

[Input binding](functions-bindings-web-pubsub-input)[Output binding](functions-bindings-web-pubsub-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.WebPubSub/).

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

Note

The Web PubSub extensions for Java is not supported yet.

## Key concepts

(1)-(2) `WebPubSubConnection`

input binding with HttpTrigger to generate client connection.

(3)-(4) `WebPubSubTrigger`

trigger binding or `WebPubSubContext`

input binding with HttpTrigger to handle service request.

(5)-(6) `WebPubSub`

output binding to request service do something.

## Connection

You can use [connection string](#connection-string) or [Microsoft Entra identity](#identity-based-connections) to connect to Azure Web PubSub service.

### Connection String

By default, an application setting named `WebPubSubConnectionString`

is used to store your Web PubSub connection string. When you choose to use a different setting name for your connection, you must explicitly set that as the key name in your binding definitions. During local development, you must also add this setting to the `Values`

collection in the [ local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file).

Important

A connection string includes the authorization information required for your application to access Azure Web PubSub service. The access key inside the connection string is similar to a root password for your service. For optimal security, your function app should use [managed identities](#identity-based-connections) when connecting to the Web PubSub service instead of using a connection string.

For details on how to configure and use Web PubSub and Azure Functions together, refer to [Tutorial: Create a serverless notification app with Azure Functions and Azure Web PubSub service](../azure-web-pubsub/tutorial-serverless-notification).

### Identity-based connections

If you're using Azure Web PubSub Functions Extensions v1.10.0 or higher, instead of using a connection string with an access key, you can configure your function app to authenticate to Azure Web PubSub using a Microsoft Entra identity.

This approach removes the need to manage secrets and is recommended for production workloads.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure the Microsoft Entra identity used by your function app has been granted an appropriate Azure RBAC role on the target Web PubSub resource:

#### Configuration

Identity-based connections in Azure Functions use a set of settings that share a common prefix. By default, Azure Web PubSub Functions extensions look for settings with the prefix `WebPubSubConnectionString`

. You can customize this prefix by setting the `connection`

property in your trigger or binding.

For Azure Web PubSub, the service-specific setting you must provide is the service endpoint URI:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `WebPubSubConnectionString__serviceUri` |
The URI of your Web PubSub service endpoint. | Yes |

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified. For more information on how to customize the identity, [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Example configuration

The following example shows how to configure identity-based with default settings:

```
{
"WebPubSubConnectionString__serviceUri": "https://your-webpubsub.webpubsub.azure.com"
}
```


Note

When using `local.settings.json`

file at local, [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp), or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for identity-based connections, replace `__`

with `:`

in the setting name to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `WebPubSubConnectionString:serviceUri`

.

# Dapr Secret input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr secret input binding allows you to read secrets data as input during function execution.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("RetrieveSecret")]
public static void Run(
[DaprServiceInvocationTrigger] object args,
[DaprSecret("kubernetes", "my-secret", Metadata = "metadata.namespace=default")] IDictionary<string, string> secret,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.");
}
```


The following example creates a `"RetrieveSecret"`

function using the `DaprSecretInput`

binding with the [ DaprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke):

```
@FunctionName("RetrieveSecret")
public void run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "RetrieveSecret") Object args,
@DaprSecretInput(
secretStoreName = "kubernetes",
key = "my-secret",
metadata = "metadata.namespace=default")
Map<String, String> secret,
final ExecutionContext context)
```


In the following example, the Dapr secret input binding is paired with a Dapr invoke trigger, which is registered by the `app`

object:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('RetrieveSecret', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'daprServiceInvocationTrigger',
name: "payload"
}),
extraInputs: [daprSecretInput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.");
const daprSecretInputValue = context.extraInputs.get(daprSecretInput);
// print the fetched secret value
for (var key in daprSecretInputValue) {
context.log(`Stored secret: Key=${key}, Value=${daprSecretInputValue[key]}`);
}
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings":
{
"type": "daprSecret",
"direction": "in",
"name": "secret",
"key": "my-secret",
"secretStoreName": "localsecretstore",
"metadata": "metadata.namespace=default"
}
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload, $secret
)
# PowerShell function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a RetrieveSecretLocal request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $secret | ConvertTo-Json
Write-Host "$jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr Secret input binding, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprSecret`

binding alongside the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveSecret")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveSecret")
@app.dapr_secret_input(arg_name="secret", secret_store_name="localsecretstore", key="my-secret", metadata="metadata.namespace=default")
def main(payload, secret: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveSecret --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.')
secret_dict = json.loads(secret)
for key in secret_dict:
logging.info("Stored secret: Key = " + key +
', Value = ' + secret_dict[key])
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprSecret`

to define a Dapr secret input binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
SecretStoreName |
The name of the secret store to get the secret. |
Key |
The key identifying the name of the secret to get. |
Metadata |
Optional. An array of metadata properties in the form `"key1=value1&key2=value2"` . |

## Annotations

The `DaprSecretInput`

annotation allows you to have your function access a secret.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
secretStoreName |
The name of the Dapr secret store. |
key |
The secret key value. |
metadata |
Optional. The metadata values. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
key |
The secret key value. |
secretStoreName |
Name of the secret store as defined in the local-secret-store.yaml component file. |

# Quickstart: Create and deploy Azure Functions resources using Bicep

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you use Bicep to create a function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure, along with its required Azure resources. The function app provides a serverless execution context for your function code executions. The app uses Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities to connect to other Azure resources.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

[Bicep](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. It provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse. Bicep offers the best authoring experience for your infrastructure-as-code solutions in Azure.

After you create the function app, you can deploy your Azure Functions project code to that app. A final code deployment step is outside the scope of this quickstart article.

## Prerequisites

### Azure account

Before you begin, you must have an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Review the Bicep file

The Bicep file used in this quickstart is from an [Azure Quickstart Template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-flex-managed-identities/main.bicep).

This deployment file creates these Azure resources needed by a function app that securely connects to Azure services:

: creates your function app.**Microsoft.Web/sites**: creates a serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan for your app.**Microsoft.Web/serverfarms**: creates an Azure Storage account, which is required by Functions.**Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts**: creates an Application Insights instance for monitoring your app.**Microsoft.Insights/components**: creates a workspace required by Application Insights.**Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces**: creates a user-assigned managed identity that's used by the app to authenticate with other Azure services using Microsoft Entra.**Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities**: creates role assignments to the user-assigned managed identity, which provide the app with least-privilege access when connecting to other Azure services.**Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments**

Deployment considerations:

- The storage account is used to store important app data, including the application code deployment package. This deployment creates a storage account that is accessed using Microsoft Entra ID authentication and managed identities. Identity access is granted on a least-permissions basis.
- The Bicep file defaults to creating a C# app that uses .NET 8 in an isolated process. For other languages, use the
`functionAppRuntime`

and`functionAppRuntimeVersion`

parameters to specify the specific language and version on which to run your app. Make sure to select your programming language at the[top](#top)of the article.

## Deploy the Bicep file

Save the Bicep file as

**main.bicep**to your local computer.Deploy the Bicep file using either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

`az group create --name exampleRG --location <SUPPORTED_REGION> az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters functionAppRuntime=dotnet-isolated functionAppRuntimeVersion=8.0`

`az group create --name exampleRG --location <SUPPORTED_REGION> az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters functionAppRuntime=java functionAppRuntimeVersion=17`

`az group create --name exampleRG --location <SUPPORTED_REGION> az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters functionAppRuntime=node functionAppRuntimeVersion=20`

`az group create --name exampleRG --location <SUPPORTED_REGION> az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters functionAppRuntime=python functionAppRuntimeVersion=3.11`

`az group create --name exampleRG --location <SUPPORTED_REGION> az deployment group create --resource-group exampleRG --template-file main.bicep --parameters functionAppRuntime=powerShell functionAppRuntimeVersion=7.4`

In this example, replace

`<SUPPORTED_REGION>`

with a region that[supports the Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-how-to#view-currently-supported-regions).When the deployment finishes, you should see a message indicating the deployment succeeded.


## Validate the deployment

Use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to validate the deployment.

```
az resource list --resource-group exampleRG
```


## Visit function app welcome page

Use the output from the previous validation step to retrieve the unique name created for your function app.

Open a browser and enter the following URL:

**<https://<appName.azurewebsites.net>**. Make sure to replace**<\appName>**with the unique name created for your function app.When you visit the URL, you should see a page like this:


## Clean up resources

Now that you have deployed a function app and related resources to Azure, can continue to the next step of publishing project code to your app. Otherwise, use these commands to delete the resources, when you no longer need them.

```
az group delete --name exampleRG
```


You can also remove resources by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Next steps

You can now deploy a code project to the function app resources you created in Azure.

You can create, verify, and deploy a code project to your new function app from these local environments:

As new versions become available, you might want to update your function apps to take advantage of new features. Support in Functions also ends for older versions and typically aligns with community end-of-support timelines. For more information, see the [language runtime support policy](language-support-policy). For supported versions of various languages, see [Languages by runtime version](supported-languages#languages-by-runtime-version).

To help ensure your function apps continue to receive support, follow the instructions in this article to update them to the latest available versions. The way that you update your function app depends on several factors:

- The language you use to develop your function apps. Make sure to select your programming language at the top of this article.
- The operating system on which your function app runs in Azure: Windows or Linux.
- The
[hosting plan](functions-scale).

Note

This article shows you how to update the .NET version of a function app that uses the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). If your function app runs on an older version of .NET and uses the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), consider the following options:

## Prepare your function app

Before you update the stack configuration for your function app in Azure, complete the tasks in the following sections.

### Review dependencies

Before updating language versions, review these potential dependencies:

**Extension bundles**: Verify that your`host.json`

file references a compatible[extension bundle version](functions-bindings-register#extension-bundles). Version 4.x bundles are recommended for most scenarios.

**Binding extensions**: Update any explicit binding extension references to versions compatible with your new language version.**Package dependencies**: Review and update all package dependencies to versions that support your target language version.**Local tools**: Ensure your local development tools, such as Azure Functions Core Tools, SDKs, and IDEs, support the new language version.

### Verify your function app locally

Test and verify your function app code locally on the new target version.

Use these steps to update the project on your local computer:

Ensure that the

[target version of the .NET SDK is installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).If you're targeting a preview version, see

[Functions guidance for preview .NET versions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#preview-net-versions)to ensure that the version is supported. Using .NET previews might require more steps.Update your references to the latest versions of

[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker/)and[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk/).Update your project's target framework to the new version. For C# projects, you must update the

`<TargetFramework>`

element in the*.csproj*file. For more information about your version, see[Target frameworks](/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks).Changing your project's target framework might also require changes to parts of your toolchain, outside project code. For example, in Visual Studio Code, you might need to update the

`azureFunctions.deploySubpath`

extension setting in your user settings or your project's*.vscode/settings.json*file. Check for any dependencies on the framework version that exist outside your project code, as part of build steps or a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.Make any updates to your project code that the new .NET version requires. Check the version's release notes for specific information. You can also use the

[.NET Upgrade Assistant](/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview)to help update your code in response to changes across major versions.

After you make those changes, rebuild your project and test it to confirm your function app runs as expected.

### Move to the latest Functions runtime

Make sure your function app runs on the latest version of the Functions runtime (version 4.x). You can determine the runtime version either in the Azure portal or by using the Azure CLI.

Use these steps to determine your Functions runtime version:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**.Go to the

**Function runtime settings**tab and check the**Runtime version**value. Your function app should run on version 4.x of the Functions runtime (`~4`

).

If you need to update your function app to version 4.x, see [Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 1.x to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) or [Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 3.x to version 4.x](migrate-version-3-version-4). Follow the instructions in those articles rather than just changing the `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

setting.

### Publish function app updates

If you updated your function app to run correctly on the new version, publish the function app updates before you update the stack configuration for your function app.

Tip

To streamline the update process, minimize downtime for your function apps, and provide a potential version for rollback, publish your updated function app to a staging slot. For more information, see [Azure Functions deployment slots](functions-deployment-slots#add-a-slot).

When you publish your updated function app to a staging slot, make sure to follow the slot-specific update instructions in the rest of this article. You later swap the updated staging slot into production.

### Consider using slots

Before updating your function app's language version, create a [deployment slot](functions-deployment-slots#add-a-slot) to use for testing and deployment. This approach minimizes downtime and provides an easy rollback option if issues occur. The examples in this article use a staging slot named `staging`

.

**Flex Consumption plan**: Slots aren't currently supported. You should first verify your updated code in a non-production function app. When deploying to a running app, you might be able to use the rolling update strategy. For more information, see [Site update strategies in Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-site-updates).

Important

The rolling update strategy is currently in preview and isn't recommended for production apps. Review the current [limitations and considerations](flex-consumption-site-updates#rolling-update-strategy-considerations) before enabling this strategy in any production app.

## Update the stack configuration

The way that you update the stack configuration depends on whether your function app runs on Windows or on Linux in Azure.

When you use a [staging slot](functions-deployment-slots), make sure to target your updates to the correct slot.

Use the following steps to update the Java version:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**. If you have a staging slot, select the specific slot.On the

**General settings**tab, update**Java Version**to the desired version.Select

**Save**. When you're notified about a restart, select**Continue**.

Use the following steps to update the .NET version:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**. If you have a staging slot, select the specific slot.On the

**General settings**tab, update**.NET Version**to the desired version.Select

**Save**. When you're notified about a restart, select**Continue**.

Use the following steps to update the Node.js version:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**. If you have a staging slot, select the specific slot.On the

**General settings**tab, update**Node.js Version**to the desired version.Select

**Save**. When you're notified about a restart, select**Continue**. This change updates theapplication setting.`WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION`


Use the following steps to update the PowerShell version:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**. If you have a staging slot, select the specific slot.On the

**General settings**tab, update**PowerShell Core Version**to the desired version.Select

**Save**. When you're notified about a restart, select**Continue**.

The portal doesn't support Python apps on Windows. Go to the **Linux** tab instead.

Your function app restarts after you update the version.

Note

During the restart, your function app is unavailable for a brief period, typically 30-60 seconds. If you update a production function app directly (without using a staging slot), plan for this downtime during a maintenance window. The restart terminates any in-flight requests, and new requests fail until the app restarts successfully.

## Verify the update

After your function app restarts, verify that the language version update was successful.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate and select your function app. On the side menu, select**Settings**>**Configuration**.On the

**General settings**tab, verify that the language version displays the new version you selected.Select

**Overview**on the side menu and confirm that the**Status**shows as**Running**.

After verifying the version, also verify that your functions work as expected.

## Swap slots

If you use a staging slot to deploy your code project and update your settings, swap the staging slot into production. For more information, see [Swap slots](functions-deployment-slots#swap-slots).

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues after updating the language version, use the following guidance to resolve common problems:

### Function app doesn't start

**Symptoms:** The function app status shows as **Stopped** or continuously restarts.

**Solutions:**

Check the application logs in the Azure portal:

- Navigate to your function app and select
**Monitoring**>**Log stream**. - Look for error messages related to runtime or language version mismatches.

- Navigate to your function app and select
Verify that all dependencies are compatible with the new language version:

- For .NET, ensure NuGet packages support the target framework.
- For Python, check that package versions in
`requirements.txt`

are compatible. - For Node.js, verify
`package.json`

dependencies support the new Node version.

Check the

[extension bundle version](functions-bindings-register#extension-bundles)in your`host.json`

file. Older bundles might not support newer language versions.

### Functions fail with runtime errors

**Symptoms:** Individual functions fail when triggered, with errors in the logs.

**Solutions:**

Review breaking changes for your language version:

- See
[Breaking changes in .NET](/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/breaking-changes)for your target version.

- Review
[Java release notes](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)for migration guidance.

- Check
[Node.js release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)for breaking changes.

- See
[What's new in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/)for version-specific changes.

- Review
[PowerShell release notes](/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/overview)for changes.

- See
Update binding extensions to versions compatible with your new language version.

Test functions locally with the new language version before redeploying.


### Extension version conflicts

**Symptoms:** Errors that mention "extension" or "binding" version incompatibilities.

**Solutions:**

Update the

[extension bundle](functions-bindings-register#extension-bundles)version in`host.json`

to version 4.x or later.`{ "version": "2.0", "extensionBundle": { "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle", "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)" } }`

For .NET projects that use explicit extension references, update all

`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

packages to their latest versions.

### Rolling back the update

If you need to revert to the previous language version:

If you used a staging slot:

- Swap the staging slot back to production.
- Update the staging slot back to the previous version for future attempts.

If you updated production directly:

- Follow the same update steps in this article but specify your previous language version.
- Redeploy your previous code version.

Monitor your function app to ensure it returns to normal operation.


Tip

To avoid issues, always test language version updates in a staging slot before applying them to production. Create a backup of your function app configuration before making changes.

# Azure Cosmos DB trigger for Azure Functions 2.x and higher

The Azure Cosmos DB Trigger uses the [Azure Cosmos DB change feed](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed) to listen for inserts and updates across partitions. The change feed publishes new and updated items, not including updates from deletions. For an end-to-end scenario that uses the Azure Cosmos DB trigger, see [Quickstart: Respond to database changes in Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions](scenario-database-changes-azure-cosmosdb).

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2).

Cosmos DB scaling decisions for the Consumption and Premium plans are done via target-based scaling. For more information, see [Target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

The Python v1 programming model requires you to define bindings in a separate *function.json* file in the function folder. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

The usage of the trigger depends on the extension package version and the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

An in-process class library is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.

The following examples depend on the extension version for the given C# mode.

Apps using [Azure Cosmos DB extension version 4.x](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2?tabs=extensionv4) or higher have different attribute properties, which are shown here. This example refers to a simple `ToDoItem`

type.

```
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV2
{
// Customize the model with your own desired properties
public class ToDoItem
{
public string id { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV2
{
public static class CosmosTrigger
{
[FunctionName("CosmosTrigger")]
public static void Run([CosmosDBTrigger(
databaseName: "databaseName",
containerName: "containerName",
Connection = "CosmosDBConnectionSetting",
LeaseContainerName = "leases",
CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true)]IReadOnlyList<ToDoItem> input, ILogger log)
{
if (input != null && input.Count > 0)
{
log.LogInformation("Documents modified " + input.Count);
log.LogInformation("First document Id " + input[0].id);
}
}
}
}
```


The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that is invoked when there are inserts or updates in the specified database and collection.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV2
{
public static class CosmosTrigger
{
[FunctionName("CosmosTrigger")]
public static void Run([CosmosDBTrigger(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
LeaseCollectionName = "leases",
CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists = true)]IReadOnlyList<Document> documents,
ILogger log)
{
if (documents != null && documents.Count > 0)
{
log.LogInformation($"Documents modified: {documents.Count}");
log.LogInformation($"First document Id: {documents[0].Id}");
}
}
}
}
```


This example refers to a simple `ToDoItem`

type:

```
public class ToDoItem
{
public string? Id { get; set; }
public string? Description { get; set; }
}
```


The following function is invoked when there are inserts or updates in the specified database and collection.

```
[Function("CosmosTrigger")]
public void Run([CosmosDBTrigger(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
containerName:"TriggerItems",
Connection = "CosmosDBConnection",
LeaseContainerName = "leases",
CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true)] IReadOnlyList<ToDoItem> todoItems,
FunctionContext context)
{
if (todoItems is not null && todoItems.Any())
{
foreach (var doc in todoItems)
{
_logger.LogInformation("ToDoItem: {desc}", doc.Description);
}
}
}
```


The following code defines a `MyDocument`

type:

```
public class MyDocument
{
public string? Id { get; set; }
public string? Text { get; set; }
public int Number { get; set; }
public bool Boolean { get; set; }
}
```


An `IReadOnlyList<T>`

is used as the Azure Cosmos DB trigger binding parameter in the following example:

```
[Function(nameof(CosmosDBFunction))]
[ExponentialBackoffRetry(5, "00:00:04", "00:15:00")]
[CosmosDBOutput("%CosmosDb%", "%CosmosContainerOut%", Connection = "CosmosDBConnection", CreateIfNotExists = true)]
public object? Run(
[CosmosDBTrigger(
"%CosmosDb%",
"%CosmosContainerIn%",
Connection = "CosmosDBConnection",
LeaseContainerName = "leases",
CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true)] IReadOnlyList<MyDocument> input,
FunctionContext context)
{
if (input != null && input.Any())
{
foreach (var doc in input)
{
_logger.LogInformation("Doc Id: {id}", doc.Id);
}
// Cosmos Output
return input.Select(p => new { id = p.Id });
}
return null;
}
```


This example requires the following `using`

statements:

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
```


This function is invoked when there are inserts or updates in the specified database and container.

Because of schema changes in the Azure Cosmos DB SDK, version 4.x of the Azure Cosmos DB extension requires [azure-functions-java-library V3.0.0](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.functions/azure-functions-java-library/3.0.0) for Java functions.

```
@FunctionName("CosmosDBTriggerFunction")
public void run(
@CosmosDBTrigger(
name = "items",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
containerName = "Items",
leaseContainerName="leases",
connection = "AzureCosmosDBConnection",
createLeaseContainerIfNotExists = true
)
Object inputItem,
final ExecutionContext context
) {
context.getLogger().info("Items modified: " + inputItems.size());
}
```


```
@FunctionName("cosmosDBMonitor")
public void cosmosDbProcessor(
@CosmosDBTrigger(name = "items",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
leaseCollectionName = "leases",
createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists = true,
connectionStringSetting = "AzureCosmosDBConnection") String[] items,
final ExecutionContext context ) {
context.getLogger().info(items.length + "item(s) is/are changed.");
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@CosmosDBTrigger`

annotation on parameters whose value would come from Azure Cosmos DB. This annotation can be used with native Java types, plain-old Java objects (POJOs), or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

.

The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB trigger [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript). The function writes log messages when Azure Cosmos DB records are added or modified.

```
import { app, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function cosmosDBTrigger1(documents: unknown[], context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log(`Cosmos DB function processed ${documents.length} documents`);
}
app.cosmosDB('cosmosDBTrigger1', {
connection: '<connection-app-setting>',
databaseName: 'Tasks',
containerName: 'Items',
createLeaseContainerIfNotExists: true,
handler: cosmosDBTrigger1,
});
```


TypeScript samples aren't documented for model v3.

The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB trigger [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node). The function writes log messages when Azure Cosmos DB records are added or modified.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.cosmosDB('cosmosDBTrigger1', {
connection: '<connection-app-setting>',
databaseName: 'Tasks',
containerName: 'Items',
createLeaseContainerIfNotExists: true,
handler: (documents, context) => {
context.log(`Cosmos DB function processed ${documents.length} documents`);
},
});
```


The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB trigger binding in a *function.json* file and a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that uses the binding. The function writes log messages when Azure Cosmos DB records are added or modified.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseCollectionName": "leases",
"connectionStringSetting": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"collectionName": "Items",
"createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists": true
}
```


```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseContainerName": "leases",
"connection": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"containerName": "Items",
"createLeaseContainerIfNotExists": true
}
```


Note that some of the binding attribute names changed in version 4.x of the Azure Cosmos DB extension.

Here's the JavaScript code:

```
module.exports = async function (context, documents) {
context.log('First document Id modified : ', documents[0].id);
}
```


The following example shows how to run a function as data changes in Azure Cosmos DB.

```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseCollectionName": "leases",
"connectionStringSetting": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"collectionName": "Items",
"createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists": true
}
```


```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseContainerName": "leases",
"connection": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"containerName": "Items",
"createLeaseContainerIfNotExists": true
}
```


Note that some of the binding attribute names changed in version 4.x of the Azure Cosmos DB extension.

In the *run.ps1* file, you have access to the document that triggers the function via the `$Documents`

parameter.

```
param($Documents, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "First document Id modified : $($Documents[0].id)"
```


The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB trigger binding. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="CosmosDBTrigger")
@app.cosmos_db_trigger(arg_name="documents",
connection="CONNECTION_SETTING",
database_name="DB_NAME",
container_name="CONTAINER_NAME",
lease_container_name="leases",
create_lease_container_if_not_exists="true")
def test_function(documents: func.DocumentList) -> str:
if documents:
logging.info('Document id: %s', documents[0]['id'])
```


The function writes log messages when Azure Cosmos DB records are modified. Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseCollectionName": "leases",
"connectionStringSetting": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"collectionName": "Items",
"createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists": true
}
```


```
{
"type": "cosmosDBTrigger",
"name": "documents",
"direction": "in",
"leaseContainerName": "leases",
"connection": "<connection-app-setting>",
"databaseName": "Tasks",
"containerName": "Items",
"createLeaseContainerIfNotExists": true
}
```


Note that some of the binding attribute names changed in version 4.x of the Azure Cosmos DB extension.

Here's the Python code:

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
def main(documents: func.DocumentList) -> str:
if documents:
logging.info('First document Id modified: %s', documents[0]['id'])
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use `CosmosDBTriggerAttribute`

to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#azure-cosmos-db-v2-trigger).

The specific properties depends both on the process model and the extension version:

In-process libraries use [CosmosDBTriggerAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB/Trigger/CosmosDBTriggerAttribute.cs) from the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`

namespace, which defines these properties:

| Attribute property |
Description |
**Connection** |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account being monitored. For more information, see [Connections](#connections). |
**DatabaseName** |
The name of the Azure Cosmos DB database with the container being monitored. |
**ContainerName** |
The name of the container being monitored. |
**LeaseConnection** |
(Optional) The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account that holds the lease container.
When not set, the `Connection` value is used. This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created in the portal. The connection string for the leases container must have write permissions. |
**LeaseDatabaseName** |
(Optional) The name of the database that holds the container used to store leases. When not set, the value of the `databaseName` setting is used. |
**LeaseContainerName** |
(Optional) The name of the container used to store leases. When not set, the value `leases` is used. |
**CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists** |
(Optional) When set to `true` , the leases container is automatically created when it doesn't already exist. The default value is `false` . When using Microsoft Entra identities if you set the value to `true` , creating containers is not [an allowed operation](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/troubleshoot-forbidden#non-data-operations-are-not-allowed) and your Function won't be able to start. |
**LeasesContainerThroughput** |
(Optional) Defines the number of Request Units to assign when the leases container is created. This setting is only used when `CreateLeaseContainerIfNotExists` is set to `true` . This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created using the portal. |
**LeaseContainerPrefix** |
(Optional) When set, the value is added as a prefix to the leases created in the Lease container for this function. Using a prefix allows two separate Azure Functions to share the same Lease container by using different prefixes. |
**FeedPollDelay** |
(Optional) The time (in milliseconds) for the delay between polling a partition for new changes on the feed, after all current changes are drained. Default is 5,000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds. |
**LeaseAcquireInterval** |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval to kick off a task to compute if partitions are distributed evenly among known host instances. Default is 13000 (13 seconds). |
**LeaseExpirationInterval** |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval for which the lease is taken on a lease representing a partition. If the lease is not renewed within this interval, it will cause it to expire and ownership of the partition will move to another instance. Default is 60000 (60 seconds). |
**LeaseRenewInterval** |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the renew interval for all leases for partitions currently held by an instance. Default is 17000 (17 seconds). |
**MaxItemsPerInvocation** |
(Optional) When set, this property sets the maximum number of items received per Function call. If operations in the monitored container are performed through stored procedures, [transaction scope](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#transactions) is preserved when reading items from the change feed. As a result, the number of items received could be higher than the specified value so that the items changed by the same transaction are returned as part of one atomic batch. |
**StartFromBeginning** |
(Optional) This option tells the Trigger to read changes from the beginning of the container's change history instead of starting at the current time. Reading from the beginning only works the first time the trigger starts, as in subsequent runs, the checkpoints are already stored. Setting this option to `true` when there are leases already created has no effect. |
**StartFromTime** |
(Optional) Gets or sets the date and time from which to initialize the change feed read operation. The recommended format is ISO 8601 with the UTC designator, such as `2021-02-16T14:19:29Z` . This is only used to set the initial trigger state. After the trigger has a lease state, changing this value has no effect. |
**PreferredLocations** |
(Optional) Defines preferred locations (regions) for geo-replicated database accounts in the Azure Cosmos DB service. Values should be comma-separated. For example, "East US,South Central US,North Europe". |

In-process libraries use [CosmosDBTriggerAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB/Trigger/CosmosDBTriggerAttribute.cs) from the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`

namespace, which defines these properties:

| Attribute property |
Description |
**ConnectionStringSetting** |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account being monitored. For more information, see [Connections](#connections). |
**DatabaseName** |
The name of the Azure Cosmos DB database with the collection being monitored. |
**CollectionName** |
The name of the collection being monitored. |
**LeaseConnectionStringSetting** |
(Optional) The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account that holds the lease collection.
When not set, the `ConnectionStringSetting` value is used. This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created in the portal. The connection string for the leases collection must have write permissions. |
**LeaseDatabaseName** |
(Optional) The name of the database that holds the collection used to store leases. When not set, the value of the `databaseName` setting is used. |
**LeaseCollectionName** |
(Optional) The name of the collection used to store leases. When not set, the value `leases` is used. |
**CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists** |
(Optional) When set to `true` , the leases collection is automatically created when it doesn't already exist. The default value is `false` . |
**LeasesCollectionThroughput** |
(Optional) Defines the number of Request Units to assign when the leases collection is created. This setting is only used when `CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists` is set to `true` . This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created using the portal. |
**LeaseCollectionPrefix** |
(Optional) When set, the value is added as a prefix to the leases created in the Lease collection for this function. Using a prefix allows two separate Azure Functions to share the same Lease collection by using different prefixes. |
**FeedPollDelay** |
(Optional) The time (in milliseconds) for the delay between polling a partition for new changes on the feed, after all current changes are drained. Default is 5,000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds. |
**LeaseAcquireInterval** |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval to kick off a task to compute if partitions are distributed evenly among known host instances. Default is 13000 (13 seconds). |
**LeaseExpirationInterval** |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval for which the lease is taken on a lease representing a partition. If the lease is not renewed within this interval, it will cause it to expire and ownership of the partition will move to another instance. Default is 60000 (60 seconds). |

**CheckpointDocumentCount** |
(Optional) Customizes the amount of documents between lease checkpoints. Default is after every function call. |
**MaxItemsPerInvocation** |
(Optional) When set, this property sets the maximum number of items received per Function call. If operations in the monitored collection are performed through stored procedures, [transaction scope](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs#transactions) is preserved when reading items from the change feed. As a result, the number of items received could be higher than the specified value so that the items changed by the same transaction are returned as part of one atomic batch. |
**StartFromBeginning** |
(Optional) This option tells the Trigger to read changes from the beginning of the collection's change history instead of starting at the current time. Reading from the beginning only works the first time the trigger starts, as in subsequent runs, the checkpoints are already stored. Setting this option to `true` when there are leases already created has no effect. |
**PreferredLocations** |
(Optional) Defines preferred locations (regions) for geo-replicated database accounts in the Azure Cosmos DB service. Values should be comma-separated. For example, "East US,South Central US,North Europe". |
**UseMultipleWriteLocations** |
(Optional) Enables multi-region accounts for writing to the leases collection. |
**UseDefaultJsonSerialization** |
(Optional) Lets you use `JsonConvert.DefaultSettings` in the monitored collection. This setting only applies to the monitored collection and the consumer to setup the serialization used in the monitored collection. The `JsonConvert.DefaultSettings` must be set in a class derived from `CosmosDBWebJobsStartup` . |

## Usage

The trigger requires a second collection that it uses to store *leases* over the partitions. Both the collection being monitored and the collection that contains the leases must be available for the trigger to work.

Important

If multiple functions are configured to use an Azure Cosmos DB trigger for the same collection, each of the functions should use a dedicated lease collection or specify a different `LeaseCollectionPrefix`

for each function. Otherwise, only one of the functions is triggered. For information about the prefix, see the [Attributes section](#attributes).

Important

If multiple functions are configured to use an Azure Cosmos DB trigger for the same collection, each of the functions should use a dedicated lease collection or specify a different `leaseCollectionPrefix`

for each function. Otherwise, only one of the functions is triggered. For information about the prefix, see the [Annotations section](#annotations).

Important

If multiple functions are configured to use an Azure Cosmos DB trigger for the same collection, each of the functions should use a dedicated lease collection or specify a different `leaseCollectionPrefix`

for each function. Otherwise, only one of the functions is triggered. For information about the prefix, see the [Configuration section](#configuration).

The trigger doesn't indicate whether a document was updated or inserted, it just provides the document itself. If you need to handle updates and inserts differently, you could do that by implementing timestamp fields for insertion or update.

The parameter type supported by the Azure Cosmos DB trigger depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to process a single document, the Cosmos DB trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type |
Description |
| JSON serializable types |
Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data of the document from the Cosmos DB change feed into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |

When you want the function to process a batch of documents, the Cosmos DB trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type |
Description |
`IEnumerable<T>` where `T` is a JSON serializable type |
An enumeration of entities included in the batch. Each entry represents one document from the Cosmos DB change feed. |

## Connections

The `connectionStringSetting`

/`connection`

and `leaseConnectionStringSetting`

/`leaseConnection`

properties are references to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Azure Cosmos DB. They may specify:

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

The connection string for your database account should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the connection property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 4.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2?tabs=extensionv4), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the connection property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property |
Environment variable template |
Description |
Example value |
| Account Endpoint |
`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__accountEndpoint` |
The Azure Cosmos DB account endpoint URI. |
https://<database_account_name>.documents.azure.com:443/ |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

Cosmos DB does not use Azure RBAC for data operations. Instead, it uses a [Cosmos DB built-in RBAC system](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac) which is built on similar concepts. You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your database account at runtime. Azure RBAC Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Azure Cosmos DB extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

1 These roles cannot be used in an Azure RBAC role assignment. See the [Cosmos DB built-in RBAC system](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac) documentation for details on how to assign these roles.

2 When using identity, Cosmos DB treats container creation as a management operation. It is not available as a data-plane operation for the trigger. You will need to ensure that you create the containers needed by the trigger (including the lease container) before setting up your function.

# Tutorial: Establish Azure Functions private site access

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to enable [private site access](functions-networking-options#private-endpoints) with Azure Functions. By using private site access, you can require that your function code is only triggered from a specific virtual network.

Private site access is useful in scenarios when access to the function app needs to be limited to a specific virtual network. For example, the function app may be applicable to only employees of a specific organization, or services which are within the specified virtual network (such as another Azure Function, Azure Virtual Machine, or an AKS cluster).

If a Functions app needs to access Azure resources within the virtual network, or connected via [service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview), then [virtual network integration](functions-create-vnet) is needed.

In this tutorial, you learn how to configure private site access for your function app:

- Create a virtual machine
- Create an Azure Bastion service
- Create an Azure Functions app
- Configure a virtual network service endpoint
- Create and deploy an Azure Function
- Invoke the function from outside and within the virtual network

If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

## Topology

The following diagram shows the architecture of the solution to be created:

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, it's important that you understand IP addressing and subnetting. You can start with [this article that covers the basics of addressing and subnetting](https://support.microsoft.com/help/164015/understanding-tcp-ip-addressing-and-subnetting-basics). Many more articles and videos are available online.

## Sign in to Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Create a virtual machine

The first step in this tutorial is to create a new virtual machine inside a virtual network. The virtual machine will be used to access your function once you've restricted its access to only be available from within the virtual network.

Select the

**Create a resource**button.In the search field, type

**Windows Server**, and select**Windows Server**in the search results.Select

**Windows Server 2019 Datacenter**from the list of Windows Server options, and press the**Create**button.In the

*Basics*tab, use the VM settings as specified in the table below the image:Setting Suggested value Description *Subscription*Your subscription The subscription under which your resources are created. *Resource group*myResourceGroup Choose the resource group to contain all the resources for this tutorial. Using the same resource group makes it easier to clean up resources when you're done with this tutorial. *Virtual machine name*myVM The VM name needs to be unique in the resource group *Region*(US) North Central US Choose a region near you or near the functions to be accessed. *Public inbound ports*None Select **None**to ensure there is no inbound connectivity to the VM from the internet. Remote access to the VM will be configured via the Azure Bastion service.Choose the

*Networking*tab and select**Create new**to configure a new virtual network.In

*Create virtual network*, use the settings in the table below the image:Setting Suggested value Description *Name*myResourceGroup-vnet You can use the default name generated for your virtual network. *Address range*10.10.0.0/16 Use a single address range for the virtual network. *Subnet name*Tutorial Name of the subnet. *Address range*(subnet)10.10.1.0/24 The subnet size defines how many interfaces can be added to the subnet. This subnet is used by the VM. A /24 subnet provides 254 host addresses. Select

**OK**to create the virtual network.Back in the

*Networking*tab, ensure**None**is selected for*Public IP*.Choose the

*Management*tab, then in*Diagnostic storage account*, choose**Create new**to create a new Storage account.Leave the default values for the

*Identity*,*Auto-shutdown*, and*Backup*sections.Select

*Review + create*. After validation completes, select**Create**. The VM create process takes a few minutes.

## Configure Azure Bastion

[Azure Bastion](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-bastion/) is a fully managed Azure service which provides secure RDP and SSH access to virtual machines directly from the Azure portal. Using the Azure Bastion service removes the need to configure network settings related to RDP access.

In the portal, choose

**Add**at the top of the resource group view.In the search field, type

**Bastion**.Select

**Bastion**in the search results.Select

**Create**to begin the process of creating a new Azure Bastion resource. You will notice an error message in the*Virtual network*section as there is not yet an AzureBastionSubnet subnet. The subnet is created in the following steps. Use the settings in the table below the image:Setting Suggested value Description *Name*myBastion The name of the new Bastion resource *Region*North Central US Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services your functions access.*Virtual network*myResourceGroup-vnet The virtual network in which the Bastion resource will be created in *Subnet*AzureBastionSubnet The subnet in your virtual network to which the new Bastion host resource will be deployed. You must create a subnet using the name value **AzureBastionSubnet**. This value lets Azure know which subnet to deploy the Bastion resources to. You must use a subnet of at least**/27**or larger (/27, /26, and so on).Note

For a detailed, step-by-step guide to creating an Azure Bastion resource, refer to the

[Create an Azure Bastion host](../bastion/tutorial-create-host-portal)tutorial.Create a subnet in which Azure can provision the Azure Bastion host. Choosing

**Manage subnet configuration**opens a new pane where you can define a new subnet. Choose**+ Subnet**to create a new subnet.The subnet must be of the name

**AzureBastionSubnet**and the subnet prefix must be at least**/27**. Select**OK**to create the subnet.On the

*Create a Bastion*page, select the newly created**AzureBastionSubnet**from the list of available subnets.Select

**Review & Create**. Once validation completes, select**Create**. It will take a few minutes for the Azure Bastion resource to be created.

## Create an Azure Functions app

The next step is to create a function app in Azure using the [Consumption plan](consumption-plan). You deploy your function code to this resource later in the tutorial.

In the portal, choose

**Add**at the top of the resource group view.Select

**Compute > Function App**On the

*Basics*section, use the function app settings as specified in the table below.Setting Suggested value Description *Resource Group*myResourceGroup Choose the resource group to contain all the resources for this tutorial. Using the same resource group for the function app and VM makes it easier to clean up resources when you're done with this tutorial. *Function App name*Globally unique name Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, and -. *Publish*Code Option to publish code files or a Docker container. *Runtime stack*Preferred language Choose a runtime that supports your favorite function programming language. *Region*North Central US Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services your functions access.Select the

**Next: Hosting >**button.For the

*Hosting*section, select the proper*Storage account*,*Operating system*, and*Plan*as described in the following table.Setting Suggested value Description *Storage account*Globally unique name Create a storage account used by your function app. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only. You can also use an existing account, which must meet the [storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).*Operating system*Preferred operating system An operating system is pre-selected for you based on your runtime stack selection, but you can change the setting if necessary. *Plan*Consumption The [hosting plan](functions-scale)dictates how the function app is scaled and resources available to each instance.Select

**Review + Create**to review the app configuration selections.Select

**Create**to provision and deploy the function app.

## Configure access restrictions

The next step is to configure [access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions) to ensure only resources on the virtual network can invoke the function.

[Private site](functions-networking-options#private-endpoints) access is enabled by creating an Azure Virtual Network [service endpoint](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) between the function app and the specified virtual network. Access restrictions are implemented via service endpoints. Service endpoints ensure only traffic originating from within the specified virtual network can access the designated resource. In this case, the designated resource is the Azure Function.

Within the function app, select the

**Networking**link under the*Settings*section header.The

*Networking*page is the starting point to configure Azure Front Door, the Azure CDN, and also Access Restrictions.Select

**Configure Access Restrictions**to configure private site access.On the

*Access Restrictions*page, you see only the default restriction in place. The default doesn't place any restrictions on access to the function app. Select**Add rule**to create a private site access restriction configuration.In the

*Add Access Restriction*pane, provide a*Name*,*Priority*, and*Description*for the new rule.Select

**Virtual Network**from the*Type*drop-down box, then select the previously created virtual network, and then select the**Tutorial**subnet.Note

It may take several minutes to enable the service endpoint.

The

*Access Restrictions*page now shows that there is a new restriction. It may take a few seconds for the*Endpoint status*to change from Disabled through Provisioning to Enabled.Important

Each function app has an

[Advanced Tool (Kudu) site](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions#restrict-access-to-an-scm-site)that is used to manage function app deployments. This site is accessed from a URL like:`<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.scm.azurewebsites.net`

. Enabling access restrictions on the Kudu site prevents the deployment of the project code from a local developer workstation, and then an agent is needed within the virtual network to perform the deployment.

## Access the functions app

Return to the previously created function app. In the

*Overview*section, copy the URL.If you try to access the function app now from your computer outside of your virtual network, you'll receive an HTTP 403 page indicating that access is forbidden.

Return to the resource group and select the previously created virtual machine. In order to access the site from the VM, you need to connect to the VM via the Azure Bastion service.

Select

**Connect**and then choose**Bastion**.Provide the required username and password to log into the virtual machine.

Note

For enhanced security, you should require Microsoft Entra authentication to access your virtual machines in Azure.

Select

**Connect**. A new browser window will pop up to allow you to interact with the virtual machine. It's possible to access the site from the web browser on the VM because the VM is accessing the site through the virtual network. While the site is only accessible from within the designated virtual network, a public DNS entry remains.

## Create a function

The next step in this tutorial is to create an HTTP-triggered Azure Function. Invoking the function via an HTTP GET or POST should result in a response of "Hello, {name}".

Follow one of the following quickstarts to create and deploy your Azure Functions app.

When publishing your Azure Functions project, choose the function app resource that you created earlier in this tutorial.

Verify the function is deployed.


## Invoke the function directly

In order to test access to the function, you need to copy the function URL. Select the deployed function, and then select

**Get Function Url**. Then click the**Copy**button to copy the URL to your clipboard.Paste the URL into a web browser. When you now try to access the function app from a computer outside of your virtual network, you receive an HTTP 403 response indicating access to the app is forbidden.


## Invoke the function from the virtual network

Accessing the function via a web browser (by using the Azure Bastion service) on the configured VM on the virtual network results in success!

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group:

From the Azure portal menu or home page, select

**Resource groups**>**myResourceGroup**.On the

**myResourceGroup**pane, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**. Type**myResourceGroup**in the text box to confirm, and then select**Delete**.

# Run your functions from a package file in Azure

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In Azure, you can run your functions directly from a deployment package file in your function app. The other option is to deploy your files in the `c:\home\site\wwwroot`

(Windows) or `/home/site/wwwroot`

(Linux) directory of your function app.

This article describes the benefits of running your functions from a package. It also shows how to enable this functionality in your function app.

## Benefits of running from a package file

There are several benefits to running functions from a package file:

- Reduces the risk of file copy locking issues.
- Can be deployed to a production app (with restart).
- Verifies the files that are running in your app.
- Improves the performance of
[Azure Resource Manager deployments](functions-infrastructure-as-code). - Reduces cold-start times, particularly for JavaScript functions with large npm package trees.

For more information, see [this announcement](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/84).

## Enable functions to run from a package

Function apps on the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) hosting plan run from a package by default. No special configuration needs to be done.

To enable your function app to run from a package on the [Consumption](consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) hosting plans, add a `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting to your function app. The `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting can have one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
`1` |
Indicates that the function app runs from a local package file deployed in the `c:\home\data\SitePackages` (Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages` (Linux) folder of your function app. |
`<URL>` |
Sets a URL that is the remote location of the specific package file you want to run. Required for functions apps running on Linux in a Consumption plan. |

The following table indicates the recommended `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

values for deployment to a specific operating system and hosting plan:

| Hosting plan | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
|

`1`

is highly recommended.`<URL>`

is supported.[Premium](functions-premium-plan)`1`

is recommended.`1`

is recommended.[Dedicated](dedicated-plan)`1`

is recommended.`1`

is recommended.## General considerations

- Do not add the
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting to apps on the[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan)plan. - The package file must be .zip formatted. Tar and gzip formats aren't supported.
[Zip deployment](#integration-with-zip-deployment)is recommended.- When deploying your function app to Windows, you should set
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

to`1`

and publish with zip deployment. - When you run from a package, the
`wwwroot`

folder is read-only and you receive an error if you write files to this directory. Files are also read-only in the Azure portal. - The maximum size for a deployment package file is 1 GB.
- The deployment uses temporary storage when unpacking your project files. This means that your function app must have enough available temporary storage space to hold the contents of your package. Keep in mind that the temporary storage limit for a Consumption plan is
[500 MB per plan](functions-scale#service-limits). To learn about how to troubleshoot issues with temporary storage, see[How to troubleshoot temporary storage on Azure App Service](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/app-service/temporary-storage-for-azure-app-service).

- The deployment uses temporary storage when unpacking your project files. This means that your function app must have enough available temporary storage space to hold the contents of your package. Keep in mind that the temporary storage limit for a Consumption plan is
- You can't use the local cache when running from a deployment package.
- If your project needs to use remote build, don't use the
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting. Instead, add the`SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`

deployment customization app setting. For Linux, also add the`ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD=true`

setting. For more information, see[Remote build](functions-deployment-technologies#remote-build).

Note

The `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting does not work with MSDeploy as described in [MSDeploy VS. ZipDeploy](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/MSDeploy-VS.-ZipDeploy). You will receive an error during deployment, such as `ARM-MSDeploy Deploy Failed`

. To resolve this error, change `/MSDeploy`

to `/ZipDeploy`

.

### Add the WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting

There are several ways that you can add, update, and delete function app settings:

Changes to function app settings require your function app to be restarted.

### Creating the zip archive

The zip archive you deploy must contain all of the files needed to run your function app. You can manually create a zip archive from the contents of a Functions project folder using built-in .zip compression functionality or non-Microsoft tools.

The archive must include the [host.json](functions-host-json) file at the root of the extracted folder. The selected language stack for the function app creates other requirements:

Important

For languages that generate compiled output for deployment, make sure to compress the contents of the output folder you plan to publish and not the entire project folder. When Functions extracts the contents of the zip archive, the `host.json`

file must exist in the root of the package.

## Use WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = 1

This section provides information about how to run your function app from a local package file.

### Considerations for deploying from an on-site package

- Using an on-site package is the recommended option for running from the deployment package, except when running on Linux hosted in a Consumption plan.
[Zip deployment](#integration-with-zip-deployment)is the recommended way to upload a deployment package to your site.- When not using zip deployment, make sure the
`c:\home\data\SitePackages`

(Windows) or`/home/data/SitePackages`

(Linux) folder has a file named`packagename.txt`

. This file contains only the name, without any whitespace, of the package file in this folder that's currently running.

### Integration with zip deployment

Zip deployment is a feature of Azure App Service that lets you deploy your function app project to the `wwwroot`

directory. The project is packaged as a .zip deployment file. The same APIs can be used to deploy your package to the `c:\home\data\SitePackages`

(Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages`

(Linux) folder.

When you set the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting value to `1`

, the zip deployment APIs copy your package to the `c:\home\data\SitePackages`

(Windows) or `/home/data/SitePackages`

(Linux) folder instead of extracting the files to `c:\home\site\wwwroot`

(Windows) or `/home/site/wwwroot`

(Linux). It also creates the `packagename.txt`

file. After your function app is automatically restarted, the package is mounted to `wwwroot`

as a read-only filesystem. For more information about zip deployment, see [Zip deployment for Azure Functions](deployment-zip-push).

Note

When a deployment occurs, a restart of the function app is triggered. Function executions currently running during the deploy are terminated. For information about how to write stateless and defensive functions, sett [Write functions to be stateless](performance-reliability#write-functions-to-be-stateless).

## Use WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = URL

This section provides information about how to run your function app from a package deployed to a URL endpoint. This option is the only one supported for running from a Linux-hosted package with a Consumption plan. This option is not supported in the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) plan.

### Considerations for deploying from a URL

- Do not set
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = <URL>`

in apps on the[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan)plan. This option is not supported. - Function apps running on Windows experience a slight increase in
[cold-start time](event-driven-scaling#cold-start)when the application package is deployed to a URL endpoint via`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE = <URL>`

. - When you specify a URL, you must also
[manually sync triggers](functions-deployment-technologies#trigger-syncing)after you publish an updated package. - The Functions runtime must have permissions to access the package URL.
- Don't deploy your package to Azure Blob Storage as a public blob. Instead, use a private container with a
[shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview)or[use a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity)to enable the Functions runtime to access the package. - You must maintain any SAS URLs used for deployment. When an SAS expires, the package can no longer be deployed. In this case, you must generate a new SAS and update the setting in your function app. You can eliminate this management burden by
[using a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity). - When running on a Premium plan, make sure to
[eliminate cold starts](functions-premium-plan#eliminate-cold-starts). - When you're running on a Dedicated plan, ensure you enable
[Always On](dedicated-plan#always-on). - You can use
[Azure Storage Explorer](../vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer)to upload package files to blob containers in your storage account.

### Manually uploading a package to Blob Storage

To deploy a zipped package when using the URL option, you must create a .zip compressed deployment package and upload it to the destination. The following procedure deploys to a container in Blob Storage:

Create a .zip package for your project using the utility of your choice.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for your storage account name or browse for it in the storage accounts list.In the storage account, select

**Containers**under**Data storage**.Select

**+ Container**to create a new Blob Storage container in your account.In the

**New container**page, provide a**Name**(for example,*deployments*), ensure the**Anonymous access level**is**Private**, and then select**Create**.Select the container you created, select

**Upload**, browse to the location of the .zip file you created with your project, and then select**Upload**.After the upload completes, choose your uploaded blob file, and copy the URL. If you aren't

[using a managed identity](#fetch-a-package-from-azure-blob-storage-using-a-managed-identity), you might need to generate a SAS URL.Search for your function app or browse for it in the

**Function App**page.In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, select**+ Add**.Enter the value

`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

for the**Name**, and paste the URL of your package in Blob Storage for the**Value**.Select

**Apply**, and then select**Apply**and**Confirm**to save the setting and restart the function app.

Now you can run your function in Azure to verify that deployment of the deployment package .zip file was successful.

### Fetch a package from Azure Blob Storage using a managed identity

You can configure Azure Blob Storage to [authorize requests with Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/authorize-access-azure-active-directory?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2fblobs%2ftoc.json). This configuration means that instead of generating a SAS key with an expiration, you can instead rely on the application's [managed identity](/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity). By default, the app's system-assigned identity is used. If you wish to specify a user-assigned identity, you can set the `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE_BLOB_MI_RESOURCE_ID`

app setting to the resource ID of that identity. The setting can also accept `SystemAssigned`

as a value, which is equivalent to omitting the setting.

To enable the package to be fetched using the identity:

Ensure that the blob is

[configured for private access](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/anonymous-read-access-configure#set-the-anonymous-access-level-for-a-container).Grant the identity the

[Storage Blob Data Reader](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader)role with scope over the package blob. See[Assign an Azure role for access to blob data](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access)for details on creating the role assignment.Set the

`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

application setting to the blob URL of the package. This URL is usually of the form`https://{storage-account-name}.blob.core.windows.net/{container-name}/{path-to-package}`

or similar.If you wish to specify a user-assigned identity, you can set the

`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE_BLOB_MI_RESOURCE_ID`

app setting to the resource ID of that identity. The setting can also accept "SystemAssigned" as a value, although this is the same as omitting the setting altogether. A resource ID is a standard representation for a resource in Azure. For a user-assigned managed identity, that is going to be`/subscriptions/subid/resourcegroups/rg-name/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/identity-name`

. The resource ID of a user-assigned managed identity can be obtained in the**Settings**->**Properties**->**ID for the user assigned managed identity**.

# Azure Functions error handling and retries

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Handling errors in Azure Functions helps you avoid lost data, avoid missed events, and monitor the health of your application. It's also an important way to help you understand the retry behaviors of event-based triggers.

This article describes general strategies for error handling and the available retry strategies.

Important

The preview of retry policy support for certain triggers was removed in December 2022. Retry policies for supported triggers are now in general availability (GA). The [Retries](#retries) section of this article lists extensions that currently support retry policies.

## Handling errors

Errors that occur in an Azure function can come from:

- Use of built-in Azure Functions
[triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings). - Calls to APIs of underlying Azure services.
- Calls to REST endpoints.
- Calls to client libraries, packages, or non-Microsoft APIs.

To avoid loss of data or missed messages, you should practice good error handling. This table describes some recommended error-handling practices and provides links to more information:

| Recommendation | Details |
|---|---|
| Enable Application Insights | Azure Functions integrates with Application Insights to collect error data, performance data, and runtime logs. Use Application Insights to discover and better understand errors that occur in your function executions. To learn more, see
|

[Binding error codes](#binding-error-codes)in this article. Depending on your specific retry strategy, you might also raise a new exception to run the function again.[Retries](#retries)in this article.[Designing Azure Functions for identical input](functions-idempotent).Tip

When you use output bindings, you can't handle errors that occur from accessing the remote service. Because of this behavior, you should validate all data passed to your output bindings to avoid raising any known exceptions. If you must be able to handle such exceptions in your function code, you should access the remote service by using the client SDK instead of relying on output bindings.

## Retries

Two kinds of retries are available for your functions:

- Built-in retry behaviors of individual trigger extensions
- Retry policies that the Azure Functions runtime provides

The following table indicates which triggers support retries and where the retry behavior is configured. It also links to more information about errors that come from the underlying services.

| Trigger/binding | Retry source | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Cosmos DB |
|

[Binding extension](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs)[host.json](functions-bindings-storage-queue#host-json)[Binding extension](../event-grid/delivery-and-retry)[Retry policies](#retry-policies)[Retry policies](#retry-policies)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#poison-messages)[host.json](functions-bindings-storage-queue#host-json)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-rabbitmq-trigger#dead-letter-queues)[Dead letter queue](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)[host.json](functions-bindings-service-bus#hostjson-settings)*[Retry policies](#retry-policies)* Requires version 5.x of the Azure Service Bus extension. In older extension versions, the [Service Bus dead letter queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dead-letter-queues#maximum-delivery-count) implements retry behaviors.

## Retry policies

With Azure Functions, you can define retry policies for specific trigger types. The runtime enforces these retry policies. The following trigger types currently support retry policies:

Retry support is the same for both v1 and v2 Python programming models.

Retry policies aren't supported in version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime.

The retry policy tells the runtime to rerun a failed execution until either successful completion occurs or the maximum number of retries is reached.

A retry policy is evaluated when a function that a supported trigger type executes raises an uncaught exception. As a best practice, you should catch all exceptions in your code and raise new exceptions for any errors that you want to result in a retry.

Important

Event Hubs checkpoints aren't written until after the retry policy for the execution finishes. Because of this behavior, progress on the specific partition is paused until the current batch finishes processing. For more information, see [Reliable event processing with Azure Functions and Event Hubs](functions-reliable-event-processing).

Version 5.x of the Event Hubs extension supports extra retry capabilities for interactions between the Azure Functions host and the event hub. For more information, see `clientRetryOptions`

in the [Event Hubs host.json reference](functions-bindings-event-hubs#host-json).

### Retry strategies

You can configure two retry strategies that are supported by policy:

A specified amount of time is allowed to elapse between each retry.

When you use a Consumption plan, you're billed only for the time that your function code is running. You aren't billed for the wait time between executions in either of these retry strategies.

### Maximum retry counts

You can configure the maximum number of times that a function execution is retried before eventual failure. The current retry count is stored in the memory of the instance.

It's possible for an instance to have a failure between retry attempts. When an instance fails during a retry policy, the retry count is lost. When there are instance failures, the Event Hubs trigger can resume processing and retry the batch on a new instance, with the retry count reset to zero. The timer trigger doesn't resume on a new instance.

This behavior means that the maximum retry count is a best effort. In some rare cases, an execution could be retried more than the requested maximum number of times. For timer triggers, the retries can be less than the requested maximum number.

### Retry examples

Examples are provided for both fixed delay and exponential backoff strategies. To see examples for a specific strategy, you must first select that strategy on the previous tab.

Function-level retries are supported with the following NuGet packages:

[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk)version 1.9.0 and later[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs)version 5.2.0 and later[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kafka](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kafka)version 3.8.0 and later[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Timer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Timer)version 4.2.0 and later

```
[Function(nameof(TimerFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")] TimerInfo timerInfo,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger(nameof(TimerFunction));
logger.LogInformation($"Function Ran. Next timer schedule = {timerInfo.ScheduleStatus?.Next}");
}
```


| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`MaxRetryCount` |
Required. The maximum number of retries allowed per function execution. A value of `-1` means to retry indefinitely. |
`DelayInterval` |
The delay used between retries. Specify it as a string with the format `HH:mm:ss` . |

Here's an example of a retry policy defined in the `function.json`

file:

```
{
"disabled": false,
"bindings": [
{
....
}
],
"retry": {
"strategy": "fixedDelay",
"maxRetryCount": 4,
"delayInterval": "00:00:10"
}
}
```


You can set these properties on retry policy definitions:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`strategy` |
Required. The retry strategy to use. Valid values are `fixedDelay` and `exponentialBackoff` . |
`maxRetryCount` |
Required. The maximum number of retries allowed per function execution. A value of `-1` means to retry indefinitely. |
`delayInterval` |
The delay used between retries when you're using a `fixedDelay` strategy. Specify it as a string with the format `HH:mm:ss` . |
`minimumInterval` |
The minimum retry delay when you're using an `exponentialBackoff` strategy. Specify it as a string with the format `HH:mm:ss` . |
`maximumInterval` |
The maximum retry delay when you're using an `exponentialBackoff` strategy. Specify it as a string with the format `HH:mm:ss` . |

The way that you define the retry policy for the trigger depends on your Node.js version:

Here's an example of a timer trigger function that uses a fixed-delay retry strategy:

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.timer('timerTriggerWithRetry', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
retry: {
strategy: 'fixedDelay',
delayInterval: {
seconds: 10,
},
maxRetryCount: 4,
},
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
if (context.retryContext?.retryCount < 2) {
throw new Error('Retry!');
} else {
context.log('Timer function processed request.');
}
},
});
```


The way that you define the retry policy for the trigger depends on your Node.js version:

Here's an example of a timer trigger function that uses a fixed-delay retry strategy:

```
import { app, InvocationContext, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTriggerWithRetry(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
if (context.retryContext?.retryCount < 2) {
throw new Error('Retry!');
} else {
context.log('Timer function processed request.');
}
}
app.timer('timerTriggerWithRetry', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
retry: {
strategy: 'fixedDelay',
delayInterval: {
seconds: 10,
},
maxRetryCount: 4,
},
handler: timerTriggerWithRetry,
});
```

## Binding error codes

When you're integrating with Azure services, errors might originate from the APIs of the underlying services. Information that relates to binding-specific errors is available in the "Exceptions and return codes" sections of the following articles:

[Azure Cosmos DB](/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/http-status-codes-for-cosmosdb)[Blob Storage](functions-bindings-storage-blob-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)[Event Grid](../event-grid/troubleshoot-errors)[Event Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)[IoT Hub](functions-bindings-event-iot-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)[Notification Hubs](functions-bindings-notification-hubs#exceptions-and-return-codes)[Queue Storage](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)[Service Bus](functions-bindings-service-bus-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)[Table Storage](functions-bindings-storage-table-output#exceptions-and-return-codes)

# Azure Functions error handling and retries

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Handling errors in Azure Functions helps you avoid lost data, avoid missed events, and monitor the health of your application. It's also an important way to help you understand the retry behaviors of event-based triggers.

This article describes general strategies for error handling and the available retry strategies.

Important

The preview of retry policy support for certain triggers was removed in December 2022. Retry policies for supported triggers are now in general availability (GA). The [Retries](#retries) section of this article lists extensions that currently support retry policies.

## Handling errors

Errors that occur in an Azure function can come from:

- Use of built-in Azure Functions
[triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings). - Calls to APIs of underlying Azure services.
- Calls to REST endpoints.
- Calls to client libraries, packages, or non-Microsoft APIs.

To avoid loss of data or missed messages, you should practice good error handling. This table describes some recommended error-handling practices and provides links to more information:

| Recommendation | Details |
|---|---|
| Enable Application Insights | Azure Functions integrates with Application Insights to collect error data, performance data, and runtime logs. Use Application Insights to discover and better understand errors that occur in your function executions. To learn more, see
|

[Binding error codes](#binding-error-codes)in this article. Depending on your specific retry strategy, you might also raise a new exception to run the function again.[Retries](#retries)in this article.[Designing Azure Functions for identical input](functions-idempotent).Tip

When you use output bindings, you can't handle errors that occur from accessing the remote service. Because of this behavior, you should validate all data passed to your output bindings to avoid raising any known exceptions. If you must be able to handle such exceptions in your function code, you should access the remote service by using the client SDK instead of relying on output bindings.

## Retries

Two kinds of retries are available for your functions:

- Built-in retry behaviors of individual trigger extensions
- Retry policies that the Azure Functions runtime provides

The following table indicates which triggers support retries and where the retry behavior is configured. It also links to more information about errors that come from the underlying services.

| Trigger/binding | Retry source | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Cosmos DB |
|

[Binding extension](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs)[host.json](functions-bindings-storage-queue#host-json)[Binding extension](../event-grid/delivery-and-retry)[Retry policies](#retry-policies)[Retry policies](#retry-policies)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#poison-messages)[host.json](functions-bindings-storage-queue#host-json)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-rabbitmq-trigger#dead-letter-queues)[Dead letter queue](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html)[Binding extension](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)[host.json](functions-bindings-service-bus#hostjson-settings)*[Retry policies](#retry-policies)* Requires version 5.x of the Azure Service Bus extension. In older extension versions, the [Service Bus dead letter queue](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dead-letter-queues#maximum-delivery-count) implements retry behaviors.

## Retry policies

With Azure Functions, you can define retry policies for specific trigger types. The runtime enforces these retry policies. The following trigger types currently support retry policies:

Retry support is the same for both v1 and v2 Python programming models.

Retry policies aren't supported in version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime.

The retry policy tells the runtime to rerun a failed execution until either successful completion occurs or the maximum number of retries is reached.

A retry policy is evaluated when a function that a supported trigger type executes raises an uncaught exception. As a best practice, you should catch all exceptions in your code and raise new exceptions for any errors that you want to result in a retry.

Important

Event Hubs checkpoints aren't written until after the retry policy for the execution finishes. Because of this behavior, progress on the specific partition is paused until the current batch finishes processing. For more information, see [Reliable event processing with Azure Functions and Event Hubs](functions-reliable-event-processing).

Version 5.x of the Event Hubs extension supports extra retry capabilities for interactions between the Azure Functions host and the event hub. For more information, see `clientRetryOptions`

in the [Event Hubs host.json reference](functions-bindings-event-hubs#host-json).

### Retry strategies

You can configure two retry strategies that are supported by policy:

A specified amount of time is allowed to elapse between each retry.

When you use a Consumption plan, you're billed only for the time that your function code is running. You aren't billed for the wait time between executions in either of these retry strategies.

### Maximum retry counts

You can configure the maximum number of times that a function execution is retried before eventual failure. The current retry count is stored in the memory of the instance.

It's possible for an instance to have a failure between retry attempts. When an instance fails during a retry policy, the retry count is lost. When there are instance failures, the Event Hubs trigger can resume processing and retry the batch on a new instance, with the retry count reset to zero. The timer trigger doesn't resume on a new instance.

This behavior means that the maximum retry count is a best effort. In some rare cases, an execution could be retried more than the requested maximum number of times. For timer triggers, the retries can be less than the requested maximum number.
