Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes the networking features available across the hosting options for Azure Functions. The following networking options can be categorized as inbound and outbound networking features. Inbound features allow you to restrict access to your app, whereas outbound features allow you to connect your app to resources secured by a virtual network and control how outbound traffic is routed.

The [hosting models](functions-scale) have different levels of network isolation available. Choosing the correct one helps you meet your network isolation requirements.

## Inbound networking features

The following features let you filter inbound requests to your function app.

### Inbound access restrictions

You can use access restrictions to define a priority-ordered list of IP addresses that are allowed or denied access to your app. The list can include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or specific virtual network subnets using [service endpoints](#use-service-endpoints). When there are one or more entries, an implicit "deny all" exists at the end of the list. IP restrictions work with all function-hosting options.

Access restrictions are available in the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), [Consumption](consumption-plan), and [App Service](dedicated-plan).

Note

With network restrictions in place, you can deploy only from within your virtual network, or when you put the IP address of the machine you're using to access the Azure portal on the **Safe Recipients** list. However, you can still manage the function using the portal.

To learn more, see [Azure App Service static access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions).

### Private endpoints

[Azure Private Endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview) is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network.

You can use Private Endpoint for your functions hosted in the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans.

If you want to make calls to Private Endpoints, then you must make sure that your DNS lookups resolve to the private endpoint. You can enforce this behavior in one of the following ways:

- Integrate with Azure DNS private zones. When your virtual network doesn't have a custom DNS server, this is done automatically.
- Manage the private endpoint in the DNS server used by your app. To manage a private endpoint, you must know the endpoint address and use an A record to reference the endpoint you're trying to reach.
- Configure your own DNS server to forward to
[Azure DNS private zones](../dns/private-dns-privatednszone).

To learn more, see [using Private Endpoints for Web Apps](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

To call other services that have a private endpoint connection, such as storage or service bus, be sure to configure your app to make [outbound calls to private endpoints](#private-endpoints). For more details on using private endpoints with the storage account for your function app, visit [restrict your storage account to a virtual network](#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Service endpoints

Using service endpoints, you can restrict many Azure services to selected virtual network subnets to provide a higher level of security. Regional virtual network integration enables your function app to reach Azure services that are secured with service endpoints. This configuration is supported on all [plans](functions-scale#networking-features) that support virtual network integration. Follow these steps to access a secured service endpoint:

- Configure regional virtual network integration with your function app to connect to a specific subnet.
- Go to the destination service and configure service endpoints against the integration subnet.

To learn more, see [Virtual network service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).

#### Use Service Endpoints

To restrict access to a specific subnet, create a restriction rule with a **Virtual Network** type. You can then select the subscription, virtual network, and subnet that you want to allow or deny access to.

If service endpoints aren't already enabled with `Microsoft.Web`

for the subnet that you selected, they're automatically enabled unless you select the **Ignore missing Microsoft.Web service endpoints** check box. The scenario where you might want to enable service endpoints on the app but not the subnet depends mainly on whether you have the permissions to enable them on the subnet.

If you need someone else to enable service endpoints on the subnet, select the **Ignore missing Microsoft.Web service endpoints** check box. Your app is configured for service endpoints, which you enable later on the subnet.

You can't use service endpoints to restrict access to apps that run in an App Service Environment. When your app is in an App Service Environment, you can control access to it by applying IP access rules.

To learn how to set up service endpoints, see [Establish Azure Functions private site access](functions-create-private-site-access).

## Outbound networking features

You can use the features in this section to manage outbound connections made by your app.

### Virtual network integration

This section details the features that Functions supports to control data outbound from your app.

Virtual network integration gives your function app access to resources in your virtual network. Once integrated, your app routes outbound traffic through the virtual network. This allows your app to access private endpoints or resources with rules allowing traffic from only select subnets. When the destination is an IP address outside of the virtual network, the source IP will still be sent from the one of the addresses listed in your app's properties, unless you've configured a NAT Gateway.

Azure Functions supports two kinds of virtual network integration:

[Regional virtual network integration](#regional-virtual-network-integration)for apps running on the[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan),[Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan),[Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan), and[Container Apps](functions-container-apps-hosting)hosting plans (recommended)[Gateway-required virtual network integration](../app-service/configure-gateway-required-vnet-integration)for apps running on the[Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan)hosting plan

To learn how to set up virtual network integration, see [Enable virtual network integration](#enable-virtual-network-integration).

### Regional virtual network integration

Using regional virtual network integration enables your app to access:

- Resources in the same virtual network as your app.
- Resources in virtual networks peered to the virtual network your app is integrated with.
- Service endpoint secured services.
- Resources across Azure ExpressRoute connections.
- Resources across peered connections, which include Azure ExpressRoute connections.
- Private endpoints

When you use regional virtual network integration, you can use the following Azure networking features:

: You can block outbound traffic with an NSG that's placed on your integration subnet. The inbound rules don't apply because you can't use virtual network integration to provide inbound access to your app.[Network security groups (NSGs)](#network-security-groups): You can place a route table on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic where you want.[Route tables (UDRs)](#routes)

Note

When you route all of your outbound traffic into your virtual network, it's subject to the NSGs and UDRs that are applied to your integration subnet. When virtual network integrated, your function app's outbound traffic to public IP addresses is still sent from the addresses that are listed in your app properties, unless you provide routes that direct the traffic elsewhere.

Regional virtual network integration isn't able to use port 25.

Considerations for the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) plan:

- The app and the virtual network must be in the same region.
- Ensure that the
`Microsoft.App`

Azure resource provider is enabled for your subscription by[following these instructions](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider). This is needed for subnet delegation. The Azure portal and Azure CLI enforce this registration when you create a Flex Consumption app, since virtual network integration can be enabled at any point after your app is created. - The subnet delegation required when running in a Flex Consumption plan is
`Microsoft.App/environments`

. This differs from the Elastic Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans, which have a different delegation requirement. - You can plan for 40 IP addresses to be used at the most for one function app, even if the app scales beyond 40. For example, if you have 15 Flex Consumption function apps that are integrated in the same subnet, you must plan for 15x40 = 600 IP addresses used at the most. This limit is subject to change, and isn't enforced.
- The subnet can't already be in use for other purposes (like private or service endpoints, or
[delegated](../virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview)to any other hosting plan or service). While you can share the same subnet with multiple Flex Consumption apps, the networking resources are shared across these function apps, which can lead to one app impacting the performance of others on the same subnet. - You can't share the same subnet between a Container Apps environment and a Flex Consumption app.
- The Flex Consumption plan currently doesn't support subnets with names that contain underscore (
`_`

) characters.

Considerations for the [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan), and [Container Apps](functions-container-apps-hosting) plans:

- The feature is available for Elastic Premium and App Service Premium V2 and Premium V3. It's also available in Standard but only from newer App Service deployments. If you are on an older deployment, you can only use the feature from a Premium V2 App Service plan. If you want to make sure you can use the feature in a Standard App Service plan, create your app in a Premium V3 App Service plan. Those plans are only supported on our newest deployments. You can scale down if you desire after that.
- The feature can't be used by Isolated plan apps that are in an App Service Environment.
- The app and the virtual network must be in the same region.
- The feature requires an unused subnet that's a /28 or larger in an Azure Resource Manager virtual network.
- The integration subnet can be used by only one App Service plan.
- You can have up to two regional virtual network integrations per App Service plan. Multiple apps in the same App Service plan can use the same integration subnet.
- The subnet can't already be in use for other purposes (like private or service endpoints, or
[delegated](../virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview)to the Flex Consumption plan or any other service). While you can share the same subnet with multiple apps in the same App Service plan, the networking resources are shared across these function apps, which can lead to one app impacting the performance of others on the same subnet. - You can't delete a virtual network with an integrated app. Remove the integration before you delete the virtual network.
- You can't change the subscription of an app or a plan while there's an app that's using regional virtual network integration.

### Enable virtual network integration

In your function app in the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select**Networking**, then under**VNet Integration**select**Click here to configure**.Select

**Add VNet**.The drop-down list contains all of the Azure Resource Manager virtual networks in your subscription in the same region. Select the virtual network you want to integrate with.

The Flex Consumption and Elastic Premium hosting plans only support regional virtual network integration. If the virtual network is in the same region, either create a new subnet or select an empty, pre-existing subnet.

To select a virtual network in another region, you must have a virtual network gateway provisioned with point to site enabled. Virtual network integration across regions is only supported for Dedicated plans, but global peerings work with regional virtual network integration.


During the integration, your app is restarted. When integration is finished, you see details on the virtual network you're integrated with. By default, Route All is enabled, and all traffic is routed into your virtual network.

If you prefer to only have your private traffic ([RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3) traffic) routed, follow the steps in this [App Service article](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing).

### Subnets

Virtual network integration depends on a dedicated subnet. When you provision a subnet, Azure reserves the first five IP addresses for internal use. The way remaining IP addresses are consumed depends on your hosting plan. Since subnet size can't be changed after assignment, use a subnet that's large enough to accommodate whatever scale your app might reach.

#### Elastic Premium and Dedicated Plans

In Elastic Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans, each running instance of your function app consumes one IP address from the subnet. When you scale up or down, the required address space may temporarily double to accommodate the transition. If multiple apps share the same subnet, the total IP address usage is the sum of all instances across those apps, plus the temporary doubling during scaling events.

**IP Consumption Scenarios**

| Scenario | IP Address Consumption |
|---|---|
| 1 app, 1 instance | 1 IP address |
| 1 app, 5 instances | 5 IP addresses |
| 1 app, scaling from 5 to 10 instances | Up to 20 IP addresses (temporary, during scale operation) |
| 3 apps, 5 instances each | 15 IP addresses |

**CIDR Range Recommendations**

| CIDR block size | Max available addresses | Max horizontal scale (instances)1 |
|---|---|---|
| /28 | 11 | 5 |
| /27 | 27 | 13 |
| /26 | 59 | 29 |
| /25 | 123 | 612 |
| /24 | 251 | 1253 |

1Assumes that you need to scale up or down in either size or SKU at some point.

2 Although the number of IP addresses supports 61 instances, individual apps on the Dedicated plan have a [30 instance maximum](functions-scale#scale).

2 Although the number of IP addresses supports 125 instances, individual apps on the Elastic Premium plan have a [100 instance maximum](functions-scale#scale).

**Additional Considerations**

For function apps on the Elastic Premium or Dedicated plans:

- To avoid any issues with subnet capacity for Functions Elastic Premium plans, you should use a /24 with 256 addresses for Windows and a /26 with 64 addresses for Linux. When creating subnets in Azure portal as part of integrating with the virtual network, a minimum size of /24 and /26 is required for Windows and Linux respectively.
- Each App Service plan can support up to two subnets that can be used for VNet integration. Multiple apps from a single App Service plan can join the same subnet, but apps from a different plan can't use that same subnet.

#### Flex Consumption Plan

In the Flex Consumption plan, outbound network traffic from function app instances are routed through shared gateways that are dedicated to the subnet. Each shared gateway consumes 1 IP address from the subnet. Regardless of how many apps are integrated with a single subnet, at most 27 shared gateways (27 IP addresses) will be used to support all instances. When selecting a subnet size, what matters is the total number of instances across all apps integrated with the subnet. When a subnet is used for too many instances or for apps performing I/O intensive workloads, network capacity issues may occur such as increased average latency and timeouts. The scale-out of apps will not be affected.

A /27 subnet size (27 usable IP addresses) is recommended to support a single function app, which can scale-out to a maximum of 1,000 instances.

If you expect your single function app to scale beyond 1,000 instances or expect the total instance count of multiple function apps to exceed 1,000 instances, then use a /26 subnet and contact the product group to request an increase to your maximum instance count.

Important

Integrating Flex Consumption function apps with a subnet size less than /27 or integrating multiple apps with a /27 size subnet reduces the available outbound network capacity for them. If you plan to do so, load test your apps with production-scale workloads to ensure network capacity constraints are not observed.

**IP Consumption Scenarios**

| Scenario | Maximum IP Address Consumption |
|---|---|
| 1 app | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |
| 2 apps | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |
| 10 apps | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |

### Network security groups

You can use [network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) to control traffic between resources in your virtual network. For example, you can create a security rule that blocks your app's outbound traffic from reaching a resource in your virtual network or from leaving the network. These security rules apply to apps that have configured virtual network integration. To block traffic to public addresses, you must have virtual network integration and Route All enabled. The inbound rules in an NSG don't apply to your app because virtual network integration affects only outbound traffic from your app.

To control inbound traffic to your app, use the Access Restrictions feature. An NSG that's applied to your integration subnet is in effect regardless of any routes applied to your integration subnet. If your function app is virtual network integrated with [Route All](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing#configure-application-routing) enabled, and you don't have any routes that affect public address traffic on your integration subnet, all of your outbound traffic is still subject to NSGs assigned to your integration subnet. When Route All isn't enabled, NSGs are only applied to RFC1918 traffic.

### Routes

You can use route tables to route outbound traffic from your app to wherever you want. By default, route tables only affect your RFC1918 destination traffic. When [Route All](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing) is enabled, all of your outbound calls are affected. When Route All is disabled, only private traffic (RFC1918) is affected by your route tables. Routes that are set on your integration subnet won't affect replies to inbound app requests. Common destinations can include firewall devices or gateways.

If you want to route all outbound traffic on-premises, you can use a route table to send all outbound traffic to your ExpressRoute gateway. If you do route traffic to a gateway, be sure to set routes in the external network to send any replies back.

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes also affect your app traffic. If you have BGP routes from something like an ExpressRoute gateway, your app outbound traffic is affected. By default, BGP routes affect only your RFC1918 destination traffic. When your function app is virtual network integrated with **Route All** enabled, all outbound traffic can be affected by your BGP routes.

### Outbound IP restrictions

Outbound IP restrictions are available in a Flex Consumption plan, Elastic Premium plan, App Service plan, or App Service Environment. You can configure outbound restrictions for the virtual network where your App Service Environment is deployed.

When you integrate a function app in an Elastic Premium plan or an App Service plan with a virtual network, the app can still make outbound calls to the internet by default. By integrating your function app with a virtual network with Route All enabled, you force all outbound traffic to be sent into your virtual network, where network security group rules can be used to restrict traffic. For Flex Consumption all traffic is already routed through the virtual network and **Route All** isn't needed.

To learn how to control the outbound IP using a virtual network, see [Tutorial: Control Azure Functions outbound IP with an Azure virtual network NAT gateway](functions-how-to-use-nat-gateway).

### Azure DNS private zones

After your app integrates with your virtual network, it uses the same DNS server that your virtual network is configured with and will work with the Azure DNS private zones linked to the virtual network.

### Automation

The following APIs let you programmatically manage regional virtual network integrations:

**Azure CLI**: Use thecommands to add, list, or remove a regional virtual network integration.`az functionapp vnet-integration`

**ARM templates**: Regional virtual network integration can be enabled by using an Azure Resource Manager template. For a full example, see[this Functions quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/function-premium-vnet-integration/).

## Hybrid Connections

[Hybrid Connections](../azure-relay/relay-hybrid-connections-protocol) is a feature of Azure Relay that you can use to access application resources in other networks. It provides access from your app to an application endpoint. You can't use it to access your application. Hybrid Connections is available to functions that run on Windows in all but the Consumption plan.

As used in Azure Functions, each hybrid connection correlates to a single TCP host and port combination. This means that the hybrid connection's endpoint can be on any operating system and any application as long as you're accessing a TCP listening port. The Hybrid Connections feature doesn't know or care what the application protocol is or what you're accessing. It just provides network access.

To learn more, see the [App Service documentation for Hybrid Connections](../app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections). These same configuration steps support Azure Functions.

Important

Hybrid Connections is only supported when your function app runs on Windows. Linux apps aren't supported.

## Connecting to Azure Services through a virtual network

Virtual network integration enables your function app to access resources in a virtual network. This section overviews things you should consider when attempting to connect your app to certain services.

### Restrict your storage account to a virtual network

Note

To quickly deploy a function app with private endpoints enabled on the storage account, refer to the following template: [Function app with Azure Storage private endpoints](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-storage-private-endpoints).

When you create a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. You can replace this storage account with one that is secured with service endpoints or private endpoints.

You can use a network restricted storage account with function apps on the Flex Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated (App Service) plans; the Consumption plan isn't supported. For Elastic Premium and Dedicated plans, you have to ensure that private [content share routing](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing#content-share) is configured. To learn how to configure your function app with a storage account secured with a virtual network, see [Restrict your storage account to a virtual network](configure-networking-how-to#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Use Key Vault references

You can use Azure Key Vault references to use secrets from Azure Key Vault in your Azure Functions application without requiring any code changes. Azure Key Vault is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history.

If virtual network integration is configured for the app, [Key Vault references](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) can be used to retrieve secrets from a network-restricted vault.

### Virtual network triggers (non-HTTP)

Your workload might require your app to be triggered from an event source protected by a virtual network. There's two options if you want your app to dynamically scale based on the number of events received from non-HTTP trigger sources:

- Run your function app in a
[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan). - Run your function app in an
[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)and enable virtual network trigger support.

Function apps running on the [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans don't dynamically scale based on events. Rather, scale out is dictated by [autoscale](dedicated-plan#scaling) rules you define.

#### Elastic Premium plan with virtual network triggers

The [Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) lets you create functions that are triggered by services secured by a virtual network. These non-HTTP triggers are known as *virtual network triggers*.

By default, virtual network triggers don't cause your function app to scale beyond their prewarmed instance count. However, certain extensions support virtual network triggers that cause your function app to scale dynamically. You can enable this *dynamic scale monitoring* in your function app for supported extensions in one of these ways:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your function app.Under

**Settings**select**Configuration**, then in the**Function runtime settings**tab set**Runtime Scale Monitoring**to**On**.Select

**Save**to update the function app configuration and restart the app.


Tip

Enabling the monitoring of virtual network triggers can affect the performance of your application, though the impact is likely to be small.

Support for dynamic scale monitoring of virtual network triggers isn't available in version 1.x of the Functions runtime.

The extensions in this table support dynamic scale monitoring of virtual network triggers. To get the best scaling performance, you should upgrade to versions that also support [target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling#premium-plan-with-runtime-scale-monitoring-enabled).

| Extension (minimum version) | Runtime scale monitoring only | With
|
|---|

[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage/)** Queue storage only.

Important

When you enable virtual network trigger monitoring, only triggers for these extensions can cause your app to scale dynamically. You can still use triggers from extensions that aren't in this table, but they won't cause scaling beyond their prewarmed instance count. For a complete list of all trigger and binding extensions, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

#### App Service plan and App Service Environment with virtual network triggers

When your function app runs in either an App Service plan or an App Service Environment, you can write functions that are triggered by resources secured by a virtual network. For your functions to get triggered correctly, your app must be connected to a virtual network with access to the resource defined in the trigger connection.

For example, assume you want to configure Azure Cosmos DB to accept traffic only from a virtual network. In this case, you must deploy your function app in an App Service plan that provides virtual network integration with that virtual network. Integration enables a function to be triggered by that Azure Cosmos DB resource.

## Testing considerations

When testing functions in a function app with private endpoints, you must do your testing from within the same virtual network, such as on a virtual machine (VM) in that network. To use the **Code + Test** option in the portal from that VM, you need to add following [CORS origins](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#cors) to your function app:

`https://functions-next.azure.com`

`https://functions-staging.azure.com`

`https://functions.azure.com`

`https://portal.azure.com`


When you restrict access to your function app with private endpoints or any other access restriction, you also must add the service tag `AzureCloud`

to the allowed list. To update the allowed list:

Navigate to your function app and select

**Settings**>**Networking**and then select**Inbound access configuration**>**Public network access**.Make sure that

**Public network access**is set to**Enabled from select virtual networks and IP addresses**.**Add a rule**under Site access and rules:Select

`Service Tag`

as the Source settings**Type**and`AzureCloud`

as the**Service Tag**.Make sure the action is

**Allow**, and set your desired name and priority.


## Troubleshooting

The feature is easy to set up, but that doesn't mean your experience will be problem free. If you encounter problems accessing your desired endpoint, there are some utilities you can use to test connectivity from the app console. There are two consoles that you can use. One is the Kudu console, and the other is the console in the Azure portal. To reach the Kudu console from your app, go to **Tools** > **Kudu**. You can also reach the Kudo console at [sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net. After the website loads, go to the **Debug console** tab. To get to the Azure portal-hosted console from your app, go to **Tools** > **Console**.

#### Tools

In native Windows apps, the tools **ping**, **nslookup**, and **tracert** won't work through the console because of security constraints (they work in [custom Windows containers](../app-service/quickstart-custom-container)). To fill the void, two separate tools are added. To test DNS functionality, we added a tool named **nameresolver.exe**. The syntax is:

```
nameresolver.exe hostname [optional: DNS Server]
```


You can use nameresolver to check the hostnames that your app depends on. This way you can test if you have anything misconfigured with your DNS or perhaps don't have access to your DNS server. You can see the DNS server that your app uses in the console by looking at the environmental variables WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER and WEBSITE_DNS_ALT_SERVER.

Note

The nameresolver.exe tool currently doesn't work in custom Windows containers.

You can use the next tool to test for TCP connectivity to a host and port combination. This tool is called **tcpping** and the syntax is:

```
tcpping.exe hostname [optional: port]
```


The **tcpping** utility tells you if you can reach a specific host and port. It can show success only if there's an application listening at the host and port combination, and there's network access from your app to the specified host and port.

#### Debug access to virtual network-hosted resources

A number of things can prevent your app from reaching a specific host and port. Most of the time it's one of these things:

**A firewall is in the way.**If you have a firewall in the way, you hit the TCP timeout. The TCP timeout is 21 seconds in this case. Use the**tcpping**tool to test connectivity. TCP timeouts can be caused by many things beyond firewalls, but start there.**DNS isn't accessible.**The DNS timeout is 3 seconds per DNS server. If you have two DNS servers, the timeout is 6 seconds. Use nameresolver to see if DNS is working. You can't use nslookup, because that doesn't use the DNS your virtual network is configured with. If inaccessible, you could have a firewall or NSG blocking access to DNS or it could be down.

If those items don't answer your problems, look first for things like:

**Regional virtual network integration**

- Is your destination a non-RFC1918 address and you don't have
**Route All**enabled? - Is there an NSG blocking egress from your integration subnet?
- If you're going across Azure ExpressRoute or a VPN, is your on-premises gateway configured to route traffic back up to Azure? If you can reach endpoints in your virtual network but not on-premises, check your routes.
- Do you have enough permissions to set delegation on the integration subnet? During regional virtual network integration configuration, your integration subnet is delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms. The VNet integration UI delegates the subnet to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms automatically. If your account doesn't have sufficient networking permissions to set delegation, you'll need someone who can set attributes on your integration subnet to delegate the subnet. To manually delegate the integration subnet, go to the Azure Virtual Network subnet UI and set the delegation for Microsoft.Web/serverFarms.

**Gateway-required virtual network integration**

- Is the point-to-site address range in the RFC 1918 ranges (10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 / 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 / 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255)?
- Does the gateway show as being up in the portal? If your gateway is down, then bring it back up.
- Do certificates show as being in sync, or do you suspect that the network configuration was changed? If your certificates are out of sync or you suspect that a change was made to your virtual network configuration that wasn't synced with your ASPs, select
**Sync Network**. - If you're going across a VPN, is the on-premises gateway configured to route traffic back up to Azure? If you can reach endpoints in your virtual network but not on-premises, check your routes.
- Are you trying to use a coexistence gateway that supports both point to site and ExpressRoute? Coexistence gateways aren't supported with virtual network integration.

Debugging networking issues is a challenge because you can't see what's blocking access to a specific host:port combination. Some causes include:

- You have a firewall up on your host that prevents access to the application port from your point-to-site IP range. Crossing subnets often requires public access.
- Your target host is down.
- Your application is down.
- You had the wrong IP or hostname.
- Your application is listening on a different port than what you expected. You can match your process ID with the listening port by using "netstat -aon" on the endpoint host.
- Your network security groups are configured in such a manner that they prevent access to your application host and port from your point-to-site IP range.

You don't know what address your app actually uses. It could be any address in the integration subnet or point-to-site address range, so you need to allow access from the entire address range.

More debug steps include:

- Connect to a VM in your virtual network and attempt to reach your resource host:port from there. To test for TCP access, use the PowerShell command
**Test-NetConnection**. The syntax is:

```
Test-NetConnection hostname [optional: -Port]
```


- Bring up an application on a VM and test access to that host and port from the console from your app by using
**tcpping**.

#### On-premises resources

If your app can't reach a resource on-premises, check if you can reach the resource from your virtual network. Use the **Test-NetConnection** PowerShell command to check for TCP access. If your VM can't reach your on-premises resource, your VPN or ExpressRoute connection might not be configured properly.

If your virtual network-hosted VM can reach your on-premises system but your app can't, the cause is likely one of the following reasons:

- Your routes aren't configured with your subnet or point-to-site address ranges in your on-premises gateway.
- Your network security groups are blocking access for your point-to-site IP range.
- Your on-premises firewalls are blocking traffic from your point-to-site IP range.
- You're trying to reach a non-RFC 1918 address by using the regional virtual network integration feature.

#### Deleting the App Service plan or web app before disconnecting the VNet integration

If you deleted the web app or the App Service plan without disconnecting the VNet integration first, you will not be able to do any update/delete operations on the virtual network or subnet that was used for the integration with the deleted resource. A subnet delegation 'Microsoft.Web/serverFarms' will remain assigned to your subnet and will prevent the update/delete operations.

In order to do update/delete the subnet or virtual network again you need to re-create the VNet integration and then disconnect it:

- Re-create the App Service plan and web app (it is mandatory to use the exact same web app name as before).
- Navigate to the 'Networking' blade on the web app and configure the VNet integration.
- After the VNet integration is configured, select the 'Disconnect' button.
- Delete the App Service plan or web app.
- Update/Delete the subnet or virtual network.

If you still encounter issues with the VNet integration after following the steps above, please contact Microsoft Support.

### Network troubleshooter

You can also use the Network troubleshooter to resolve connection issues. To open the network troubleshooter, go to the app in the Azure portal. Select **Diagnostic and solve problem**, and then search for **Network troubleshooter**.

**Connection issues** - It checks the status of the virtual network integration, including checking if the Private IP has been assigned to all instances of the plan and the DNS settings. If a custom DNS isn't configured, default Azure DNS is applied. The troubleshooter also checks for common Function app dependencies including connectivity for Azure Storage and other binding dependencies.


**Configuration issues** - This troubleshooter checks if your subnet is valid for virtual network integration.


**Subnet/VNet deletion issue** - This troubleshooter checks if your subnet has any locks and if it has any unused Service Association Links that might be blocking the deletion of the VNet/subnet.

# Azure Functions hosting options

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create a function app in Azure, you must choose a hosting option for your app. Azure provides you with these hosting options for your function code:

| Hosting option | Service | Availability | Container support |
|---|---|---|---|
|
Azure Functions | Generally available (GA) | None |
|
Azure Functions | GA | Linux |
|
Azure Functions | GA | Linux |
|
Azure Container Apps | GA | Linux |
|
Azure Functions | Windows - GA Linux - Retired |
None |

Important

After 30 September 2028, the option to host your function app on Linux in a Consumption plan is retired. To avoid disruptions, migrate your existing Consumption plan apps that run on Linux to the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) before that date. Apps running on Windows in a Consumption plan aren't affected by this change.
For more information, see the [Linux Consumption plan retirement notice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2335809).

The Azure App Service infrastructure on both Linux and Windows virtual machines facilitates the Azure Functions hosting options. The hosting option you choose dictates the following behaviors:

- How your function app is scaled.
- The resources available to each function app instance.
- Support for advanced functionality, such as Azure Virtual Network connectivity.
- Support for Linux containers.

The plan you choose also impacts the costs for running your function code. For more information, see [Billing](#billing).

This article provides a detailed comparison between the various hosting options. To learn more about running and managing your function code in Linux containers, see [Linux container support in Azure Functions](container-concepts).

## Overview of plans

The following table summarizes the benefits of the various options for Azure functions hosting.

| Option | Benefits |
|---|---|
|
Experience fast horizontal scaling, with flexible compute options, virtual network integration, and serverless pay-as-you-go billing. In the Flex Consumption plan, function instances dynamically scale out (up to 1,000) based on configured per-instance concurrency, incoming events, and per-function workloads for optimal efficiency. Consider the Flex Consumption plan when: ✔ You need a serverless host for your function code, paying only for on-demand executions. ✔ You require virtual network connectivity for secure access to Azure resources. ✔ Your workloads are variable and can go from no activity to demanding rapid, event-driven scaling. ✔ You want to customize compute with memory sizes (512 MB, 2,048 MB, or 4,096 MB) and reduce cold starts via one or more pre-provisioned (always-ready) instances. |
|
Automatically scales based on demand using prewarmed workers, which run applications with no delay after being idle, runs on more powerful instances, and connects to virtual networks. Consider the Azure Functions Premium plan in the following situations: ✔ Your function apps run continuously, or nearly continuously. ✔ You want more control of your instances and want to deploy multiple function apps on the same plan with event-driven scaling. ✔ You have a high number of small executions and a high execution bill, but low GB seconds in the Consumption plan. ✔ You need more CPU or memory options than are provided by consumption plans. ✔ Your code needs to run longer than the maximum execution time allowed on the Consumption plan. ✔ You require virtual network connectivity for secure access to Azure resources. ✔ You want to provide a custom Linux image in which to run your functions. |
|
Run your functions within an App Service plan at regular
Best for long-running scenarios where
✔ You have existing and underutilized virtual machines that are already running other App Service instances. ✔ You must have fully predictable billing, or you need to manually scale instances. ✔ You want to run multiple web apps and function apps on the same plan ✔ You need access to larger compute size choices. ✔ Full compute isolation and secure network access provided by an App Service Environment (ASE). ✔ Very high memory usage and high scale (ASE). |

[Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview)Use the Azure Functions programming model to build event-driven, serverless, cloud native function apps. Run your functions alongside other microservices, APIs, websites, and workflows as container-hosted programs. Consider hosting your functions on Container Apps in the following situations:

✔ You want control of the container image and want to package custom libraries with your function code to support line-of-business apps.

✔ You need to migrate code execution from on-premises or legacy apps to cloud native microservices running in containers.

✔ When you want to avoid the overhead and complexity of managing Kubernetes clusters and dedicated compute.

✔ Your functions need high-end processing power provided by dedicated GPU compute resources.

[Consumption plan](consumption-plan)On the Consumption plan, function instances are dynamically added and removed based on the number of incoming events.

Consider the Consumption plan when:

✔ You have a dependency on Windows. For example, using the v1 runtime, the full .NET Framework, or Windows-specific features like certain PowerShell modules.

✔ You want a serverless billing model and pay only when your functions are running.

The remaining tables in this article compare hosting options based on various features and behaviors.

## Operating system support

This table shows operating system support for the hosting options.

| Hosting | Linux1 deployment |
Windows2 deployment |
|---|---|---|
|
✅ Code-only ❌ Container (not supported) |
❌ Not supported |
|
✅ Code-only ✅ Container |
✅ Code-only |

✅ Container-only | ❌ Not supported |
3 |
✅ Code-only (Retired) ❌ Container (not supported) |
✅ Code-only |

- Linux is the only supported operating system for the
[Python runtime stack](functions-reference-python). - Windows deployments are code-only. Azure Functions doesn't currently support Windows containers.
- The ability to run your app on Linux in a Consumption plan will be retired on 30 September 2028. For more information, see
[Consumption plan](consumption-plan).

## Function app timeout duration

The `functionTimeout`

property in the [host.json](functions-host-json#functiontimeout) project file sets the timeout duration for functions in a function app. This property applies specifically to function executions. After the trigger starts function execution, the function needs to return or respond within the timeout duration. When an execution exceeds this duration, a timeout error occurs and the language worker process restarts. For C# apps running in-process, the host process itself restarts. To avoid timeouts and subsequent process restarts, it's important to [write robust functions](functions-best-practices#write-robust-functions). For more information, see [Improve Azure Functions performance and reliability](performance-reliability#make-sure-background-tasks-complete).

The following table shows the default and maximum values (in minutes) for specific plans:

| Plan | Default | Maximum1 |
|---|---|---|
|
30 | Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded3 |
|
30 | Unbounded5 |
|
5 | 10 |

- Regardless of the function app timeout setting, 230 seconds is the maximum amount of time that an HTTP triggered function can take to respond to a request. This limit exists because of the
[default idle timeout of Azure Load Balancer](../app-service/faq-availability-performance-application-issues#why-does-my-request-time-out-after-230-seconds). For longer processing times, consider using the[Durable Functions async pattern](durable/durable-functions-overview#async-http)or[defer the actual work and return an immediate response](performance-reliability#avoid-long-running-functions). - There's no maximum execution timeout duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes
[during scale in](event-driven-scaling#scale-in-behaviors)for the Flex Consumption and Premium plans, and a grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - Requires the App Service plan be set to
[Always On](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - The default timeout for version 1.x of the Functions host runtime is
*unbounded*. - When the
[minimum number of replicas](../container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition)is set to zero, the default timeout depends on the specific triggers used in the app.

These values assume that the Azure Functions host process starts and runs correctly. There's a maximum timeout of 60 seconds for the language-specific worker process to also start. The worker process startup timeout isn't currently configurable.

## Language support

For details on current native language stack support in Functions, see [Supported languages in Azure Functions](supported-languages).

## Scale

The following table compares the scaling behaviors of the various hosting plans.

Maximum instances are given on a per-function app (Consumption) or per-plan (Premium/Dedicated) basis, unless otherwise indicated.

| Plan | Scale out | Max # instances |
|---|---|---|

Automatic scale based on the source of events. Functions infrastructure scales resources by adding more instances of the function host, based on the number of incoming trigger events.**Windows:**200**Linux:**1005- Flex Consumption plan has a regional subscription quota that limits the total memory usage of all instances across a given region. For more information, see
[Regional subscription memory quotas](flex-consumption-plan#regional-subscription-memory-quotas). Flex Consumption plans currently only support Linux. - In some regions, Linux apps on a Premium plan can scale to 100 instances. For more information, see the
[Premium plan article](functions-premium-plan#region-max-scale-out). - For specific limits for the various App Service plan options, see the
[App Service plan limits](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-app-service-limits). - On Container Apps, the default is 10 instances, but you can set the
[maximum number of replicas](../container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition), which has an overall maximum of 1000. This setting is honored as long as there's enough cores quota available. For more information, see[Quotas for Azure Container Apps](/en-us/azure/container-apps/quotas). When you create your function app from the Azure portal, you're limited to 300 instances. - During scale-out, there's currently a limit of 500 instances per subscription per hour for Linux apps on a Consumption plan.
- For private endpoint restricted http triggers, scaling out is limited to at most 20 instances.

- The storage limit is the total content size in temporary storage across all apps in the same App Service plan. For Consumption plans on Linux, the storage is currently 1.5 GB.
- Consumption plan uses an Azure Files share for persisted storage. When you provide your own Azure Files share, the specific share size limits depend on the storage account you set for
[WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring). - On Linux, you must
[explicitly mount your own Azure Files share](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations#mount-file-shares). - When your function app is hosted in a
[Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan), only the CNAME option is supported. For function apps in a[Premium plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan)or an[App Service plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan), you can map a custom domain using either a CNAME or an A record. - There's no maximum execution time-out duration enforced.

## Limitations for creating new function apps in an existing resource group

In some cases, when trying to create a new hosting plan for your function app in an existing resource group you might receive one of the following errors:

- The pricing tier isn't allowed in this resource group
- <SKU_name> workers aren't available in resource group <resource_group_name>

These errors can occur when the following conditions are met:

- You create a function app in an existing resource group that has yet to contain another function app or web app. For example, Linux Consumption apps aren't supported in the same resource group as Linux Dedicated or Linux Premium plans.
- Your new function app is created in the same region as the previous app.
- The previous app is in some way incompatible with your new app. This incompatibility can occur between versions, operating systems, or is due to other platform-level features, such as availability zone support.

Function app and web app plans are mapped to different pools of resources when they're created. Different plans require a different set of infrastructure capabilities. When you create an app in a resource group, that resource group is mapped and assigned to a specific pool of resources. If you try to create another plan in that resource group and the mapped pool doesn't have the required resources, the previously mentioned errors occur.

If this situation happens, create your function app and hosting plan in a new resource group instead.

# Tutorial: Create a function app that connects to Azure services using identities instead of secrets

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to configure a function app using Microsoft Entra identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed. To learn more about identity-based connections, see [configure an identity-based connection](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

While the procedures shown work generally for all languages, this tutorial currently supports C# class library functions on Windows specifically.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create a function app in Azure using an ARM template
- Enable both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities on the function app
- Create role assignments that give permissions to other resources
- Move secrets that can't be replaced with identities into Azure Key Vault
- Configure an app to connect to the default host storage using its managed identity

After you complete this tutorial, you should complete the follow-on tutorial that shows how to [use identity-based connections instead of secrets with triggers and bindings](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial-2).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Why use identity?

Managing secrets and credentials is a common challenge for teams of all sizes. Secrets need to be secured against theft or accidental disclosure, and they might need to be periodically rotated. Many Azure services allow you to instead use an identity in [Microsoft Entra ID](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to authenticate clients and check against permissions, which can be modified and revoked quickly. Doing so allows for greater control over application security with less operational overhead. An identity could be a human user, such as the developer of an application, or a running application in Azure with a [managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

Because some services don't support Microsoft Entra authentication, your applications might still require secrets in certain cases. However, these secrets can be stored in [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview), which helps simplify the management lifecycle for your secrets. Access to a key vault is also controlled with identities.

By understanding how to use identities instead of secrets when you can, and to use Key Vault when you can't, you reduce risk, decrease operational overhead, and generally improve the security posture for your applications.

## Create a function app that uses Key Vault for necessary secrets

Azure Files is an example of a service that doesn't yet support Microsoft Entra authentication for Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Azure Files is the default file system for Windows deployments on Premium and Consumption plans. While we could [remove Azure Files entirely](storage-considerations#create-an-app-without-azure-files), doing so introduces limitations you might not want. Instead, you move the Azure Files connection string into Azure Key Vault. That way it's centrally managed, with access controlled by the identity.

### Create an Azure Key Vault

First you need a key vault to store secrets in. You configure it to use [Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview) for determining who can read secrets from the vault.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Security**>**Key Vault**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the key vault.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Key vault name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new key vault. The vault name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes and can't start with a number. **Pricing Tier**Standard Options for billing. Standard is sufficient for this tutorial. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.Use the default selections for the "Recovery options" sections.

Make a note of the name you used, for use later.

Select

**Next: Access Policy**to navigate to the**Access Policy**tab.Under

**Permission model**, choose**Azure role-based access control**Select

**Review + create**. Review the configuration, and then select**Create**.

### Set up an identity and permissions for the app

In order to use Azure Key Vault, your app needs to have an identity that can be granted permission to read secrets. This app uses a user-assigned identity so that the permissions can be set up before the app is even created. For more information about managed identities for Azure Functions, see [How to use managed identities in Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Identity**>**User Assigned Managed Identity**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the identity.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.**Name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new user-assigned identity. Select

**Review + create**. Review the configuration, and then select**Create**.When the identity is created, navigate to it in the portal. Select

**Properties**, and make note of the**Resource ID**for use later.Select

**Azure Role Assignments**, and select**Add role assignment (Preview)**.In the

**Add role assignment (Preview)**page, use options as shown in the following table.Option Suggested value Description **Scope**Key Vault Scope is a set of resources that the role assignment applies to. Scope has levels that are inherited at lower levels. For example, if you select a subscription scope, the role assignment applies to all resource groups and resources in the subscription. **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. **Resource**Your key vault The key vault you created earlier. **Role**Key Vault Secrets User A role is a collection of permissions that are being granted. Key Vault Secrets User gives permission for the identity to read secret values from the vault. Select

**Save**. It might take a minute or two for the role to show up when you refresh the role assignments list for the identity.

The identity is now able to read secrets stored in the key vault. Later in the tutorial, you add additional role assignments for different purposes.

### Generate a template for creating a function app

Because the portal experience for creating a function app doesn't interact with Azure Key Vault, you need to generate and edit an Azure Resource Manager template. You can then use this template to create your function app referencing the Azure Files connection string from your key vault.

Important

Don't create the function app until after you edit the ARM template. The Azure Files configuration needs to be set up at app creation time.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Compute**>**Function App**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the function app.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Function App name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z`

(case insensitive),`0-9`

.**Publish**Code Choose to publish code files or a Docker container. **Runtime stack**.NET This tutorial uses .NET. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.Select

**Review + create**. Your app uses the default values on the**Hosting**and**Monitoring**page. Review the default options, which are included in the ARM template that you generate.Instead of creating your function app here, choose

**Download a template for automation**, which is to the right of the**Next**button.In the template page, select

**Deploy**, then in the Custom deployment page, select**Edit template**.

### Edit the template

You now edit the template to store the Azure Files connection string in Key Vault and allow your function app to reference it. Make sure that you have the following values from the earlier sections before proceeding:

- The resource ID of the user-assigned identity
- The name of your key vault

Note

If you were to create a full template for automation, you would want to include definitions for the identity and role assignment resources, with the appropriate `dependsOn`

clauses. This would replace the earlier steps which used the portal. Consult the [Azure Resource Manager guidance](../azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax) and the documentation for each service.

In the editor, find where the

`resources`

array begins. Before the function app definition, add the following section, which puts the Azure Files connection string into Key Vault. Substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault.`{ "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets", "apiVersion": "2016-10-01", "name": "VAULT_NAME/azurefilesconnectionstring", "properties": { "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=',parameters('storageAccountName'),';AccountKey=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageAccountName')), '2019-06-01').keys[0].value,';EndpointSuffix=','core.windows.net')]" }, "dependsOn": [ "[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', parameters('storageAccountName'))]" ] },`

In the definition for the function app resource (which has

`type`

set to`Microsoft.Web/sites`

), add`Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/VAULT_NAME/secrets/azurefilesconnectionstring`

to the`dependsOn`

array. Again, substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault. Doing so prevents your app from being created before the secret is defined. The`dependsOn`

array should look like the following example:`{ "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites", "apiVersion": "2018-11-01", "name": "[parameters('name')]", "location": "[parameters('location')]", "tags": null, "dependsOn": [ "microsoft.insights/components/idcxntut", "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/VAULT_NAME/secrets/azurefilesconnectionstring", "[concat('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/', parameters('hostingPlanName'))]", "[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', parameters('storageAccountName'))]" ], // ... }`

Add the

`identity`

block from the following example into the definition for your function app resource. Substitute "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID" for the resource ID of your user-assigned identity.`{ "apiVersion": "2018-11-01", "name": "[parameters('name')]", "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites", "kind": "functionapp", "location": "[parameters('location')]", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned,UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": { "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID": {} } }, "tags": null, // ... }`

This

`identity`

block also sets up a system-assigned identity, which you use later in this tutorial.Add the

`keyVaultReferenceIdentity`

property to the`properties`

object for the function app, as in the following example. Substitute "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID" for the resource ID of your user-assigned identity.`{ // ... "properties": { "name": "[parameters('name')]", "keyVaultReferenceIdentity": "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID", // ... } }`

You need this configuration because an app could have multiple user-assigned identities configured. Whenever you want to use a user-assigned identity, you must specify it with an ID. System-assigned identities don't need to be specified this way, because an app can only ever have one. Many features that use managed identity assume they should use the system-assigned one by default.

Find the JSON objects that define the

`WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

application setting, which should look like the following example:`{ "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING", "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=',parameters('storageAccountName'),';AccountKey=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageAccountName')), '2019-06-01').keys[0].value,';EndpointSuffix=','core.windows.net')]" },`

Replace the

`value`

field with a reference to the secret as shown in the following example. Substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault.`{ "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING", "value": "[concat('@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=', reference(resourceId('Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets', 'VAULT_NAME', 'azurefilesconnectionstring')).secretUri, ')')]" },`

Select

**Save**to save the updated ARM template.

### Deploy the modified template

Make sure that your create options, including

**Resource Group**, are still correct and select**Review + create**.After your template validates, make a note of your

**Storage Account Name**, since you'll use this account later. Finally, select**Create**to create your Azure resources and deploy your code to the function app.After deployment completes, select

**Go to resource group**and then select the new function app.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your function app to reference the Azure Files connection string from Azure Key Vault.

Whenever your app would need to add a reference to a secret, you would just need to define a new application setting pointing to the value stored in Key Vault. For more information, see [Key Vault references for Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

Tip

The [Application Insights connection string](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string) and its included instrumentation key are not considered secrets and can be retrieved from App Insights using [Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader) permissions. You do not need to move them into an Azure Key Vault instance, although you certainly can. If you choose to use Key Vault, your function app must have a managed identity that can be used to securely retrieve the secret [using a Key Vault reference in the app settings](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references).

## Use managed identity for AzureWebJobsStorage

Next, you use the system-assigned identity you configured in the previous steps for the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection. `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used by the Functions runtime and by several triggers and bindings to coordinate between multiple running instances. It's required for your function app to operate, and like Azure Files, is configured with a connection string by default when you create a new function app.

### Grant the system-assigned identity access to the storage account

Similar to the steps you previously followed with the user-assigned identity and your key vault, you now create a role assignment granting the system-assigned identity access to your storage account.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the storage account that was created with your function app earlier.Select

**Access Control (IAM)**. This page is where you can view and configure who has access to the resource.Select

**Add**and select**add role assignment**.Search for

**Storage Blob Data Owner**, select it, and select**Next**On the

**Members**tab, under**Assign access to**, choose**Managed Identity**Select

**Select members**to open the**Select managed identities**panel.Confirm that the

**Subscription**is the one in which you created the resources earlier.In the

**Managed identity**selector, choose**Function App**from the**System-assigned managed identity**category. The**Function App**label might have a number in parentheses next to it, indicating the number of apps in the subscription with system-assigned identities.Your app should appear in a list below the input fields. If you don't see it, you can use the

**Select**box to filter the results with your app's name.Select your application. It should move down into the

**Selected members**section. Choose**Select**.On the

**Add role assignment**screen, select**Review + assign**. Review the configuration, and then select**Review + assign**.

Tip

If you intend to use the function app for a blob-triggered function, you will need to repeat these steps for the **Storage Account Contributor** and **Storage Queue Data Contributor** roles over the account used by AzureWebJobsStorage. To learn more, see [Blob trigger identity-based connections](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#identity-based-connections).

### Edit the AzureWebJobsStorage configuration

Next you update your function app to use its system-assigned identity when it uses the blob service for host storage.

Important

The `AzureWebJobsStorage`

configuration is used by some triggers and bindings, and those extensions must be able to use identity-based connections, too. Apps that use blob triggers or event hub triggers may need to update those extensions. Because no functions have been defined for this app, there isn't a concern yet. To learn more about this requirement, see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity).

Similarly, `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used for deployment artifacts when using server-side build in Linux Consumption. When you enable identity-based connections for `AzureWebJobsStorage`

in Linux Consumption, you will need to deploy via [an external deployment package](run-functions-from-deployment-package).

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your function app.In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, select the**AzureWebJobsStorage**app setting, and edit it according to the following table:Option Suggested value Description **Name**AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName Change the name from **AzureWebJobsStorage**to the exact name`AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`

. This setting instructs the host to use the identity instead of searching for a stored secret. The new setting uses a double underscore (`__`

), which is a special character in application settings.**Value**Your account name Update the name from the connection string to just your **StorageAccountName**.This configuration tells the system to use an identity to connect to the resource.

Select

**Apply**, and then select**Apply**and**Confirm**to save your changes and restart the app function.

You've now removed the storage connection string requirement for AzureWebJobsStorage by configuring your app to instead connect to blobs using managed identities.

Note

The `__accountName`

syntax is unique to the AzureWebJobsStorage connection and cannot be used for other storage connections. To learn to define other connections, check the reference for each trigger and binding your app uses.

## Next steps

This tutorial showed how to create a function app without storing secrets in its configuration.

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to use identities in trigger and binding connections.

# Troubleshoot Python errors in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides information to help you troubleshoot errors with your Python functions in Azure Functions. This article supports both the v1 and v2 programming models. Choose the model you want to use from the selector at the top of the article.

Note

The Python v2 programming model is only supported in the 4.x functions runtime. For more information, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions).

Here are the troubleshooting sections for common issues in Python functions:

Specifically with the v2 model, here are some known issues and their workarounds:

General troubleshooting guides for Python Functions include:

## Troubleshoot: ModuleNotFoundError

This section helps you troubleshoot module-related errors in your Python function app. These errors typically result in the following Azure Functions error message:

Exception: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module_name'.


This error occurs when a Python function app fails to load a Python module. The root cause for this error is one of the following issues:

[The package can't be found](#the-package-cant-be-found)[The package isn't resolved with proper Linux wheel](#the-package-isnt-resolved-with-the-proper-linux-wheel)[The package is incompatible with the Python interpreter version](#the-package-is-incompatible-with-the-python-interpreter-version)[The package conflicts with other packages](#the-package-conflicts-with-other-packages)[The package supports only Windows and macOS platforms](#the-package-supports-only-windows-and-macos-platforms)

### View project files

To identify the actual cause of your issue, you need to get the Python project files that run on your function app. If you don't have the project files on your local computer, you can get them in one of the following ways:

- If the function app has a
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting and its value is a URL, download the file by copying and pasting the URL into your browser. - If the function app has
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

set to`1`

, go to`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/vfs/data/SitePackages`

and download the file from the latest`href`

URL. - If the function app doesn't have either of the preceding app settings, go to
`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/settings`

and find the URL under`SCM_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

. Download the file by copying and pasting the URL into your browser. - If suggestions resolve the issue, go to
`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`

and view the content under`/home/site/wwwroot`

.

The rest of this article helps you troubleshoot potential causes of this error by inspecting your function app's content, identifying the root cause, and resolving the specific issue.

### Diagnose ModuleNotFoundError

This section details potential root causes of module-related errors. After you figure out which is the likely root cause, you can go to the related mitigation.

#### The package can't be found

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>`

. If the file path doesn't exist, this missing path is likely the root cause.

Using third-party or outdated tools during deployment might cause this issue.

To mitigate this issue, see [Enable remote build](#enable-remote-build) or [Build native dependencies](#build-native-dependencies).

#### The package isn't resolved with the proper Linux wheel

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

. Use your favorite text editor to open the *wheel* file and check the **Tag:** section. The issue might be that the tag value doesn't contain **linux**.

Python functions run only on Linux in Azure. The Functions runtime v2.x runs on Debian Stretch, and the v3.x runtime runs on Debian Buster. The artifact is expected to contain the correct Linux binaries. When you use the `--build local`

flag in Core Tools, third-party, or outdated tools, it might cause older binaries to be used.

To mitigate the issue, see [Enable remote build](#enable-remote-build) or [Build native dependencies](#build-native-dependencies).

#### The package is incompatible with the Python interpreter version

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

. In your text editor, open the *METADATA* file and check the **Classifiers:** section. If the section doesn't contain `Python :: 3`

, `Python :: 3.6`

, `Python :: 3.7`

, `Python :: 3.8`

, or `Python :: 3.9`

, the package version is either too old or, more likely, it's already out of maintenance.

You can check the Python version of your function app from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Navigate to your function app's **Overview** resource page to find the runtime version. The runtime version supports Python versions as described in the [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions).

To mitigate the issue, see [Update your package to the latest version](#update-your-package-to-the-latest-version) or [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents).

#### The package conflicts with other packages

If you've verified that the package is resolved correctly with the proper Linux wheels, there might be a conflict with other packages. In certain packages, the PyPi documentation might clarify the incompatible modules. For example, in [ azure 4.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/azure/4.0.0/), you find the following statement:

This package isn't compatible with azure-storage. If you installed azure-storage, or if you installed azure 1.x/2.x and didn’t uninstall azure-storage, you must uninstall azure-storage first.


You can find the documentation for your package version in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>/<package-version>`

.

To mitigate the issue, see [Update your package to the latest version](#update-your-package-to-the-latest-version) or [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents).

#### The package supports only Windows and macOS platforms

Open the `requirements.txt`

with a text editor and check the package in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

. Some packages run only on Windows and macOS platforms. For example, pywin32 runs on Windows only.

The `Module Not Found`

error might not occur when you're using Windows or macOS for local development. However, the package fails to import on Azure Functions, which uses Linux at runtime. This issue is likely to be caused by using `pip freeze`

to export the virtual environment into *requirements.txt* from your Windows or macOS machine during project initialization.

To mitigate the issue, see [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents) or [Handcraft requirements.txt](#handcraft-requirementstxt).

### Mitigate ModuleNotFoundError

The following are potential mitigations for module-related issues. Use the [previously mentioned diagnoses](#diagnose-modulenotfounderror) to determine which of these mitigations to try.

#### Enable remote build

Make sure that remote build is enabled. The way that you make sure depends on your deployment method.

Make sure that the latest version of the [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) is installed. Verify that the *.vscode/settings.json* file exists and it contains the setting `"azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment": true`

. If it doesn't, create the file with the `azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment`

setting enabled, and then redeploy the project.

#### Build native dependencies

Make sure that the latest versions of both Docker and [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/releases) are installed. Go to your local function project folder, and use `func azure functionapp publish <app-name> --build-native-deps`

for deployment.

#### Update your package to the latest version

In the latest package version of `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

, check the **Classifiers:** section. The package should be `OS Independent`

, or compatible with `POSIX`

or `POSIX :: Linux`

in **Operating System**. Also, the programming language should contain: `Python :: 3`

, `Python :: 3.6`

, `Python :: 3.7`

, `Python :: 3.8`

, or `Python :: 3.9`

.

If these package items are correct, you can update the package to the latest version by changing the line `<package-name>~=<latest-version>`

in *requirements.txt*.

#### Handcraft requirements.txt

Some developers use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

to generate the list of Python packages for their developing environments. Although this convenience should work in most cases, there can be issues in cross-platform deployment scenarios, such as developing functions locally on Windows or macOS, but publishing to a function app, which runs on Linux. In this scenario, `pip freeze`

can introduce unexpected operating system-specific dependencies or dependencies for your local development environment. These dependencies can break the Python function app when it's running on Linux.

The best practice is to check the import statement from each *.py* file in your project source code and then check in only the modules in the *requirements.txt* file. This practice guarantees that the resolution of packages can be handled properly on different operating systems.

#### Replace the package with equivalents

First, take a look into the latest version of the package in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

. This package usually has its own GitHub page. Go to the **Issues** section on GitHub and search to see whether your issue has been fixed. If it has been fixed, update the package to the latest version.

Sometimes, the package might have been integrated into [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) (such as `pathlib`

). If so, because we provide a certain Python distribution in Azure Functions (Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Python 3.8, and Python 3.9), the package in your *requirements.txt* file should be removed.

However, if you're finding that the issue hasn't been fixed, and you're on a deadline, we encourage you to do some research to find a similar package for your project. Usually, the Python community provides you with a wide variety of similar libraries that you can use.

#### Disable dependency isolation flag

Set the application setting [PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES](functions-app-settings#python_isolate_worker_dependencies) to a value of `0`

.

## Troubleshoot: cannot import 'cygrpc'

This section helps you troubleshoot 'cygrpc'-related errors in your Python function app. These errors typically result in the following Azure Functions error message:

Cannot import name 'cygrpc' from 'grpc._cython'


This error occurs when a Python function app fails to start with a proper Python interpreter. The root cause for this error is one of the following issues:

[The Python interpreter mismatches OS architecture](#the-python-interpreter-mismatches-os-architecture)[The Python interpreter isn't supported by Azure Functions Python Worker](#the-python-interpreter-isnt-supported-by-azure-functions-python-worker)

### Diagnose the 'cygrpc' reference error

There are several possible causes for errors that reference `cygrpc`

, which are detailed in this section.

#### The Python interpreter mismatches OS architecture

This mismatch is most likely caused by a 32-bit Python interpreter being installed on your 64-bit operating system.

If you're running on an x64 operating system, ensure that your Python version 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9 interpreter is also on a 64-bit version.

You can check your Python interpreter bitness by running the following commands:

On Windows in PowerShell, run `py -c 'import platform; print(platform.architecture()[0])'`

.

On a Unix-like shell, run `python3 -c 'import platform; print(platform.architecture()[0])'`

.

If there's a mismatch between Python interpreter bitness and the operating system architecture, download a proper Python interpreter from [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads).

#### The Python interpreter isn't supported by Azure Functions Python Worker

The Azure Functions Python Worker supports only [specific Python versions](functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-python#languages).

Check to see whether your Python interpreter matches your expected version by `py --version`

in Windows or `python3 --version`

in Unix-like systems. Ensure that the return result is one of the [supported Python versions](functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-python#languages).

If your Python interpreter version doesn't meet the requirements for Azure Functions, instead download a Python interpreter version that is supported by Functions from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Troubleshoot: python exited with code 137

Code 137 errors are typically caused by out-of-memory issues in your Python function app. As a result, you get the following Azure Functions error message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.Workers.WorkerProcessExitException : python exited with code 137


This error occurs when a Python function app is forced to terminate by the operating system with a `SIGKILL`

signal. This signal usually indicates an out-of-memory error in your Python process. The Azure Functions platform has a [service limitation](functions-scale#service-limits) that terminates any function apps that exceed this limit.

To analyze the memory bottleneck in your function app, see [Profile Python function app in local development environment](python-memory-profiler-reference#memory-profiling-process).

## Troubleshoot: python exited with code 139

This section helps you troubleshoot segmentation fault errors in your Python function app. These errors typically result in the following Azure Functions error message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.Workers.WorkerProcessExitException : python exited with code 139


This error occurs when a Python function app is forced to terminate by the operating system with a `SIGSEGV`

signal. This signal indicates violation of the memory segmentation, which can result from an unexpected reading from or writing into a restricted memory region. In the following sections, we provide a list of common root causes.

### A regression from third-party packages

In your function app's *requirements.txt* file, an unpinned package gets upgraded to the latest version during each deployment to Azure. Package updates can potentially introduce regressions that affect your app. To recover from such issues, comment out the import statements, disable the package references, or pin the package to a previous version in *requirements.txt*.

### Unpickling from a malformed .pkl file

If your function app is using the Python pickle library to load a Python object from a *.pkl* file, it's possible that the file contains a malformed bytes string or an invalid address reference. To recover from this issue, try commenting out the `pickle.load()`

function.

### Pyodbc connection collision

If your function app is using the popular ODBC database driver [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc), it's possible that multiple connections are open within a single function app. To avoid this issue, use the singleton pattern, and ensure that only one pyodbc connection is used across the function app.

## Sync triggers failed

The error `Sync triggers failed`

can be caused by several issues. One potential cause is a conflict between customer-defined dependencies and Python built-in modules when your functions run in an App Service plan. For more information, see [Package management](functions-reference-python#package-management).

## Troubleshoot: could not load file or assembly

You can see this error when you're running locally using the v2 programming model. This error is caused by a known issue to be resolved in an upcoming release.

This is an example message for this error:

DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=014045d636e89289'.


The system cannot find the file specified.

The error occurs because of an issue with how the extension bundle was cached. To troubleshoot the issue, run this command with `--verbose`

to see more details:

```
func host start --verbose
```


It's likely you're seeing this caching issue when you see an extension loading log like `Loading startup extension <>`

that isn't followed by `Loaded extension <>`

.

To resolve this issue:

Find the

`.azure-functions-core-tools`

path by running:`func GetExtensionBundlePath`

Delete the

`.azure-functions-core-tools`

directory.`rm -r <insert path>/.azure-functions-core-tools`


The cache directory is recreated when you run Core Tools again.

## Troubleshoot: unable to resolve the Azure Storage connection

You might see this error in your local output as the following message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask: Unable to resolve the Azure Storage connection named 'Storage'.


Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'provider')

This error is a result of how extensions are loaded from the bundle locally. To resolve this error, take one of the following actions:

Use a storage emulator such as

[Azurite](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite). This option is a good one when you aren't planning to use a storage account in your function application.Create a storage account and add a connection string to the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

environment variable in the*localsettings.json*file. Use this option when you're using a storage account trigger or binding with your application, or if you have an existing storage account. To get started, see[Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create).

## Functions not found after deployment

There are several common build issues that can cause Python functions to not be found by the host after an apparently successful deployment:

The agent pool must be running on Ubuntu to guarantee that packages are restored correctly from the build step. Make sure your deployment template requires an Ubuntu environment for build and deployment.

When the function app isn't at the root of the source repo, make sure that the

`pip install`

step references the correct location in which to create the`.python_packages`

folder. Keep in mind that this location is case sensitive, such as in this command example:`pip install --target="./FunctionApp1/.python_packages/lib/site-packages" -r ./FunctionApp1/requirements.txt`

The template must generate a deployment package that can be loaded into

`/home/site/wwwroot`

. In Azure Pipelines, this is done by the`ArchiveFiles`

task.

## Development issues in the Azure portal

When using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), take into account these known issues and their workarounds:

- There are general limitations for writing your function code in the portal. For more information, see
[Development limitations in the Azure portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#development-limitations-in-the-azure-portal).

- To delete a function from a function app in the portal, remove the function code from the file itself. The
**Delete**button doesn't work to remove the function when using the Python v2 programming model.

- When creating a function in the portal, you might be admonished to use a different tool for development. There are several scenarios where you can't edit your code in the portal, including when a syntax error has been detected. In these scenarios, use
[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python)or[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local?pivots=programming-language-python)to develop and publish your function code.

# How to use a secured storage account with Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions requires an Azure Storage account when you create a function app instance. This default storage account is used by the Functions runtime to maintain the health of your function app. For more information, see [Storage considerations for Azure Functions](storage-considerations). This article shows you how to use a secured storage account as the default storage account. For an in-depth tutorial on how to create your function app with inbound and outbound access restrictions, see the [Integrate with a virtual network](functions-create-vnet) tutorial. To learn more about Azure Functions and networking, see [Azure Functions networking options](functions-networking-options).

## Restrict your storage account to a virtual network

When you create a function app, you either create a new storage account or link to an existing one. Keep these considerations in mind when working with secured storage account.

- To create a function app that uses an existing secured storage account as the default storage account, you must create your app either in the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)or by using[ARM template](functions-infrastructure-as-code?tabs=json&pivots=premium-plan#secured-deployments)or[Bicep](functions-infrastructure-as-code?tabs=bicep&pivots=premium-plan#secured-deployments)deployments. - When using a secured storage account with a dynamic scale plan, you should host your functions in the
[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). This plan supports both secured storage accounts and managed identity-based connections to storage, which is the most secure connection option. - All tiers of both the
[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)and the[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)also support secure storage accounts. However, there are trade-offs when using managed identities to connect from a Premium plan app. For more information, see[Create an app without Azure Files](storage-considerations#create-an-app-without-azure-files). - The
[Consumption plan](consumption-plan)doesn't support virtual networks, so you can't connect to a secured storage account when running in the Consumption plan. To take advantage of serverless function hosting, you should instead recreate your app to run in Flex Consumption plan. - This article currently shows you how to create a function app in a Premium plan that connects to a secured storage account using the storage account connection string. To provide the best protection of storage account credentials, you should instead use managed identities when connecting to a storage account. Instead follow the
[Quickstart: Create and deploy functions to Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI](create-first-function-azure-developer-cli)to create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan that connects to a new secured storage account using managed identities. - For a list of all restrictions on storage accounts, see
[Storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).

## Secure storage during function app creation

You can create a function app, along with a new storage account that is secured behind a virtual network. The following sections show you how to create these resources by using either the Azure portal or by using deployment templates.

Complete the steps in [Create a function app in a Premium plan](functions-create-vnet#create-a-function-app-in-a-premium-plan). This section of the virtual networking tutorial shows you how to create a function app that connects to storage over private endpoints.

Note

When you create your function app in the Azure portal, you can also choose an existing secured storage account in the **Storage** tab. However, you must configure the appropriate networking on the function app so that it can connect through the virtual network used to secure the storage account. If you don't have permissions to configure networking or you haven't fully prepared your network, select **Configure networking after creation** in the **Networking** tab. You can configure networking for your new function app in the portal under **Settings** > **Networking**.

## Secure storage for an existing function app

When you have an existing function app, you can directly configure networking on the storage account being used by the app. However, this process results in your function app being down while you configure networking and while your function app restarts.

To minimize downtime, you can instead swap-out an existing storage account for a new, secured storage account.

### 1. Enable virtual network integration

As a prerequisite, you need to enable virtual network integration for your function app:

Choose a function app with a storage account that doesn't have service endpoints or private endpoints enabled.

[Enable virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#enable-virtual-network-integration)for your function app.

### 2. Create a secured storage account

Set up a secured storage account for your function app:

[Create a second storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create). This storage account is the secured storage account for your function app to use instead of its original unsecured storage account. You can also use an existing storage account not already being used by Functions.Save the connection string for this storage account to use later.

[Create a file share](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share#create-a-file-share)in the new storage account. For your convenience, you can use the same file share name from your original storage account. Otherwise, if you use a new file share name, you must update your app setting.Secure the new storage account in one of the following ways:

[Create a private endpoint](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#creating-a-private-endpoint). As you set up your private endpoint connection, create private endpoints for the`file`

,`blob`

and`table`

subresources. For Durable Functions, you must also make`queue`

subresources accessible through private endpoints. If you're using a custom or on-premises Domain Name System (DNS) server,[configure your DNS server](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#dns-changes-for-private-endpoints)to resolve to the new private endpoints.[Restrict traffic to specific subnets](../storage/common/storage-network-security#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network). Ensure your function app is network integrated with an allowed subnet and that the subnet has only one of these service endpoints defined:`Microsoft.Storage`

: use when your app is in the same region as your virtual network.`Microsoft.Storage.Global`

: use when your app is in a different region than your virtual network.


Copy the file and blob content from the current storage account used by the function app to the newly secured storage account and file share.

[AzCopy](../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs-copy)and[Azure Storage Explorer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/azure-tips-and-tricks-how-to-move-azure-storage-blobs-between/ba-p/3545304)are common methods. If you use Azure Storage Explorer, you might need to allow your client IP address access to your storage account's firewall.

Now you're ready to configure your function app to communicate with the newly secured storage account.

### 3. Enable application and configuration routing

Note

These configuration steps are required only for the [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan) and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) hosting plans.
The [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) doesn't require site settings to configure networking.

You're now ready to route your function app's traffic to go through the virtual network:

Enable

[application routing](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing)to route your app's traffic to the virtual network:In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Networking**. In the**Networking**page, under**Outbound traffic configuration**, select the subnet associated with your virtual network integration.In the new page, under

**Application routing**, select**Outbound internet traffic**.

If your app uses an Azure Files share, enable

[content share routing](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#content-share)by selecting**Content storage**under**Configuration routing**. This allows your app to communicate with Azure Files using the virtual network.

Note

You must take special care when routing to the content share in a storage account shared by multiple function apps in the same plan. For more information, see [Consistent routing through virtual networks](storage-considerations#consistent-routing-through-virtual-networks) in the Storage considerations article.

### 4. Update application settings

Finally, you need to update your application settings to point to the new secure storage account:

In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, update the following settings by selecting each setting, editing it, and then selecting**Apply**:Setting name Value Comment `AzureWebJobsStorage`

Storage connection string Use the connection string for your new secured storage account, which you saved earlier. `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

Storage connection string Use the connection string for your new secured storage account, which you saved earlier. Only relevant if your app is using Azure Files. `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE`

File share Use the name of the file share created in the secured storage account where the project deployment files reside. Only relevant if your app is using Azure Files. Select

**Apply**, and then**Confirm**to save the new application settings in the function app. This causes the function app to restart.

After the function app finishes restarting, it connects to the secured storage account.

# Azure Functions scenarios

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Often, you build systems that react to a series of critical events. Whether you're building a web API, responding to database changes, or processing event streams or messages, you can use Azure Functions to implement these systems.

In many cases, a function [integrates with an array of cloud services](functions-triggers-bindings) to provide feature-rich implementations. The following list shows common (but by no means exhaustive) scenarios for Azure Functions.

Select your development language at the top of the article.

## Process file uploads

You can use functions in several ways to process files into or out of a blob storage container. To learn more about options for triggering on a blob container, see [Working with blobs](storage-considerations#working-with-blobs) in the best practices documentation.

For example, in a retail solution, a partner system can submit product catalog information as files into blob storage. You can use a blob triggered function to validate, transform, and process the files into the main system as you upload them.

The following tutorials use a Blob trigger (Event Grid based) to process files in a blob container:

For example, use the blob trigger with an event subscription on blob containers:

```
[FunctionName("ProcessCatalogData")]
public static async Task Run([BlobTrigger("catalog-uploads/{name}", Source = BlobTriggerSource.EventGrid, Connection = "<NAMED_STORAGE_CONNECTION>")] Stream myCatalogData, string name, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myCatalogData.Length} Bytes");
using (var reader = new StreamReader(myCatalogData))
{
var catalogEntry = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
while(catalogEntry !=null)
{
// Process the catalog entry
// ...
catalogEntry = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
}
}
}
```

[Quickstart: Respond to blob storage events by using Azure Functions](scenario-blob-storage-events)[Sample: Blob trigger with the Event Grid source type quickstart sample)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-javascript-azd-eventgrid-blob)[Tutorial (events): Trigger Azure Functions on blob containers using an event subscription](functions-event-grid-blob-trigger?pivots=programming-language-javascript)[Tutorial (polling): Upload and analyze a file with Azure Functions and Blob Storage](../storage/blobs/blob-upload-function-trigger-javascript)

## Real-time stream and event processing

Cloud applications, IoT devices, and networking devices generate and collect a large amount of telemetry. Azure Functions can process that data in near real-time as the hot path, then store it in [Azure Cosmos DB](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) for use in an analytics dashboard.

Your functions can also use low-latency event triggers, like Event Grid, and real-time outputs like SignalR to process data in near-real-time.

For example, you can use the event hubs trigger to read from an event hub and the output binding to write to an event hub after debatching and transforming the events:

```
[FunctionName("ProcessorFunction")]
public static async Task Run(
[EventHubTrigger(
"%Input_EH_Name%",
Connection = "InputEventHubConnectionSetting",
ConsumerGroup = "%Input_EH_ConsumerGroup%")] EventData[] inputMessages,
[EventHub(
"%Output_EH_Name%",
Connection = "OutputEventHubConnectionSetting")] IAsyncCollector<SensorDataRecord> outputMessages,
PartitionContext partitionContext,
ILogger log)
{
var debatcher = new Debatcher(log);
var debatchedMessages = await debatcher.Debatch(inputMessages, partitionContext.PartitionId);
var xformer = new Transformer(log);
await xformer.Transform(debatchedMessages, partitionContext.PartitionId, outputMessages);
}
```

## Machine learning and AI

Azure Functions provides serverless compute resources that integrate with AI and Azure services to streamline building cloud-hosted intelligent applications. You can use the Functions programming model to create and host remote Model Content Protocol (MCP) servers and implement various AI tools. For more information, see [Tools and MCP servers](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps#tools-and-mcp-servers).

The [Azure OpenAI binding extension](functions-bindings-openai) lets you integrate AI features and behaviors of the [Azure OpenAI service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), into your function code executions. For more information, see [Retrieval-augmented generation](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps#retrieval-augmented-generation).

A function might also call a TensorFlow model or Azure AI services to process and classify a stream of images.

For more information, see [Use AI tools and models in Azure Functions](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps).

## Run scheduled tasks

Functions enables you to run your code based on a [cron schedule](functions-bindings-timer#usage) that you define.

See [Create a function in the Azure portal that runs on a schedule](functions-create-scheduled-function).

For example, you might analyze a financial services customer database for duplicate entries every 15 minutes to avoid multiple communications going out to the same customer.

For examples, see these code snippets:

```
[FunctionName("TimerTriggerCSharp")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */15 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
if (myTimer.IsPastDue)
{
log.LogInformation("Timer is running late!");
}
log.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
// Perform the database deduplication
}
```


## Build a scalable web API

An HTTP triggered function defines an HTTP endpoint. These endpoints run function code that can connect to other services directly or by using binding extensions. You can compose the endpoints into a web-based API.

You can also use an HTTP triggered function endpoint as a webhook integration, such as GitHub webhooks. In this way, you can create functions that process data from GitHub events. For more information, see [Monitor GitHub events by using a webhook with Azure Functions](/en-us/training/modules/monitor-github-events-with-a-function-triggered-by-a-webhook/).

For examples, see these code snippets:

```
[FunctionName("InsertName")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post")] HttpRequest req,
[CosmosDB(
databaseName: "my-database",
collectionName: "my-container",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDbConnectionString")]IAsyncCollector<dynamic> documentsOut,
ILogger log)
{
string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
string name = data?.name;
if (name == null)
{
return new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name in the request body json");
}
// Add a JSON document to the output container.
await documentsOut.AddAsync(new
{
// create a random ID
id = System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
name = name
});
return new OkResult();
}
```

## Build a serverless workflow

Functions often serve as the compute component in a serverless workflow topology, such as a Logic Apps workflow. You can also create long-running orchestrations by using the Durable Functions extension. For more information, see [Durable Functions overview](durable/durable-functions-overview).

## Respond to database changes

Some processes need to log, audit, or perform other operations when stored data changes. Functions triggers provide a good way to get notified of data changes to initial such an operation.

Consider these examples:

## Create reliable message systems

You can use Functions with Azure messaging services to create advanced event-driven messaging solutions.

For example, you can use triggers on Azure Storage queues as a way to chain together a series of function executions. Or use service bus queues and triggers for an online ordering system.

These articles show how to write output to a storage queue:

These articles show how to trigger from an Azure Service Bus queue or topic.

# Deployment technologies in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can use several different technologies to deploy your Azure Functions project code to Azure. This article provides an overview of the deployment methods available to you and recommendations for the best method to use in various scenarios. It also provides a comprehensive list of and key details about the underlying deployment technologies.

## Deployment methods

The deployment technology you use to publish code to your function app in Azure depends on your specific needs and the point in the development cycle. For example, during development and testing, you can deploy directly from your development tool, such as Visual Studio Code. When your app is in production, you're more likely to publish continuously from source control or by using an automated publishing pipeline, which can include validation and testing.

The following table describes the available deployment methods for your code project.

| Deployment type | Methods | Best for... |
|---|---|---|
| Tools-based | •
•
•
•
|

[local development tools](functions-develop-local#local-development-environments).[Deployment Center (CI/CD)](functions-continuous-deployment)•

[Container deployments](functions-how-to-custom-container#enable-continuous-deployment-to-azure)[Azure Pipelines](functions-how-to-azure-devops)•

[GitHub Actions](functions-how-to-github-actions)Use the best technology for your specific scenario. Many of the deployment methods are based on [zip deployment](#zip-deploy), which is recommended for deployment.

## Deployment technology availability

The deployment method also depends on the hosting plan and operating system on which you run your function app.

Currently, Functions offers five options for hosting your function apps:

[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan)[Consumption](consumption-plan)[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)[Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview)

Each plan has different behaviors. Not all deployment technologies are available for each hosting plan and operating system. This chart provides information on the supported deployment technologies:

| Deployment technology | Flex Consumption | Consumption | Elastic Premium | Dedicated | Container Apps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|

[Zip deploy](#zip-deploy)[External package URL](#external-package-url)1[Docker container](#docker-container)[Source control](#source-control)[Local Git](#local-git)1[FTPS](#ftps)1[In-portal editing](#portal-editing)21 Deployment technologies that require you to [manually sync triggers](#trigger-syncing) aren't recommended.

2 In-portal editing is disabled when code is deployed to your function app from outside the portal. For more information, including language support details for in-portal editing, see [Language support details](supported-languages#language-support-details).

## Key concepts

Some key concepts are critical to understanding how deployments work in Azure Functions.

### Trigger syncing

When you change any of your triggers, the Functions infrastructure must be aware of the changes. Synchronization happens automatically for many deployment technologies. However, in some cases, you must manually sync your triggers.

You must always manually sync triggers when using these deployment options:

You can manually sync triggers in one of these ways:

Restart your function app in the Azure portal. The Functions host performs a background trigger sync after the application starts.

Use the

command to send an HTTP POST request that calls the`az rest`

`syncfunctiontriggers`

API, as in this example:`az rest --method post --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<APP_NAME>/syncfunctiontriggers?api-version=2016-08-01`


Keep these considerations in mind for the sync triggers operation:

- You must manually restart your function app any time you deploy an updated version of the deployment package by using the same external package URL.
- For apps running in a Consumption or Elastic Premium plan, you must also
[manually sync triggers](#trigger-syncing)in these scenarios:- When deployments use an external package URL with a resource manager-based deployment by using ARM templates or Bicep or Terraform files.
- When you update the deployment package
*in-place*by using the same external package URL.

- When you add network restrictions to an existing function app, you must guarantee connectivity to the default host storage account set in the
`AzureWebJobsStorage`

app setting. For more information, see[How to use a secured storage account with Azure Functions](configure-networking-how-to).

### Remote build

You can request Azure Functions to perform a remote build of your code project during deployment. In these scenarios, request a remote build instead of building locally:

- You're deploying an app to a Linux-based function app that you developed on a Windows computer. This situation is commonly the case for Python app development. You can end up with incorrect libraries when you build the deployment package locally on Windows.
- Your project has dependencies on a
[custom package index](python-build-options#remote-build-with-an-extra-index-url). - You want to reduce the size of your deployment package.

How you request a remote build depends on whether your app runs in Azure on Windows or Linux.

All function apps running on Windows have a small management app, the `scm`

site provided by [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu). This site handles much of the deployment and build logic for Azure Functions.

When you deploy an app to Windows, the deployment process runs language-specific commands, like `dotnet restore`

(C#) or `npm install`

(JavaScript).

The following considerations apply when using remote builds during deployment:

- Remote builds are supported for function apps running on Linux in the Consumption plan. However, deployment options are limited for these apps because they don't have an
`scm`

(Kudu) site. - Function apps running on Linux in a
[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)or in a[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)do have an`scm`

(Kudu) site, but it's limited compared to Windows. - Remote builds don't occur when an app uses
[run-from-package](run-functions-from-deployment-package). To learn how to use remote build in these cases, see[Zip deploy](#zip-deploy). - You might have issues with remote build when your app was created before the feature was made available (August 1, 2019). For older apps, either create a new function app or run
`az functionapp update --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME>`

to update your function app. This command might take two tries to succeed.

### App content storage

Package-based deployment methods store the package in the storage account associated with the function app, which the [AzureWebJobsStorage](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) setting defines. When available, Consumption and Elastic Premium plan apps try to use the Azure Files content share from this account, but you can also maintain the package in another location. Flex Consumption plan apps use a storage container in default storage account, unless you [configure a different storage account to use for deployment](flex-consumption-how-to#configure-deployment-settings). For more information, review the details in **Where app content is stored** in each deployment technology covered in the next section.

Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

## Deployment technology details

The following deployment methods are available in Azure Functions. To determine which technologies each hosting plan supports, refer to the [deployment technology availability](#deployment-technology-availability) table.

### One deploy

One deploy is the only deployment technology supported for apps on a [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). The end result is a ready-to-run .zip package that your function app runs on.


How to use it:Deploy by using the[Visual Studio Code]publish feature, or from the command line by using[Azure Functions Core Tools]or the[Azure CLI]. Our[Azure Dev Ops Task]and[GitHub Action]similarly leverage one deploy when they detect that a Flex Consumption app is being deployed to.When you create a Flex Consumption app, you must specify a deployment storage (blob) container as well as an authentication method to it. By default the same storage account as the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection is used, with a connection string as the authentication method. Thus, your[deployment settings]are configured during app create time without any need of application settings.


When to use it:One deploy is the only deployment technology available for function apps running in a Flex Consumption plan.


Where app content is stored:When you create a Flex Consumption function app, you specify a[deployment storage container]. This blob container is where your tools upload the app content you deployed. To change the location, you can visit the Deployment Settings blade in the Azure portal or use the[Azure CLI].

Tip

A **Flex Consumption Deployment** diagnostic tool is available in the Azure portal. Open your Flex Consumption app, select **Diagnose and solve problems**, and search for `Flex Consumption Deployment`

. This tool displays detailed information about your deployments, including deployment history, package status, and troubleshooting recommendations.

### Zip deploy

Zip deploy is the default and recommended deployment technology for function apps on the Consumption, Elastic Premium, and App Service (Dedicated) plans. The end result is a ready-to-run .zip package that your function app runs on. It differs from [external package URL](#external-package-url) in that the platform is responsible for remote building and storing your app content.


How to use it:Deploy by using your favorite client tool:[Visual Studio Code],[Visual Studio], or from the command line using[Azure Functions Core Tools]or the[Azure CLI]. Our[Azure Dev Ops Task]and[GitHub Action]similarly leverage zip deploy.When you deploy by using zip deploy, you can set your app to

[run from package]. To run from package, set the[application setting value to]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

`1`

. We recommend zip deployment. It yields faster loading times for your applications, and it's the default for VS Code, Visual Studio, and the Azure CLI.


When to use it:Zip deploy is the default and recommended deployment technology for function apps on the Windows Consumption, Windows and Linux Elastic Premium, and Windows and Linux App Service (Dedicated) plans.


Where app content is stored:App content from a zip deploy is by default stored on the file system, which Azure might back by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app. In Linux Consumption, the app content is instead persisted on a blob in the storage account specified by the`AzureWebJobsStorage`

app setting, and the app setting`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

takes on the value of the blob URL.

### External package URL

External package URL is an option if you want to manually control how deployments are performed. You take responsibility for uploading a ready-to-run .zip package containing your built app content to blob storage and referencing this external URL as an application setting on your function app. Whenever your app restarts, it fetches the package, mounts it, and runs in [Run From Package](run-functions-from-deployment-package) mode.


How to use it:Add[to your application settings. The value of this setting should be a blob URL pointing to the location of the specific package you want your app to run. You can add settings either]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

[in the portal]or[by using the Azure CLI].If you use Azure Blob Storage, your Function app can access the container either by using a managed identity-based connection or with a

[shared access signature (SAS)]. The option you choose affects what kind of URL you use as the value for`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

. Managed identity is recommended for overall security and because SAS tokens expire and must be manually maintained.Whenever you deploy the package file that a function app references, you must

[manually sync triggers], including the initial deployment. When you change the contents of the package file and not the URL itself, you must also restart your function app to sync triggers. Refer to our[how-to guide]on configuring this deployment technology.


When to use it:External package URL is the only supported deployment method for apps running on the Linux Consumption plan when you don't want a[remote build]to occur. This method is also the recommended deployment technology when you[create your app without Azure Files]. For scalable apps running on Linux, you should instead consider[Flex Consumption plan]hosting.


Where app content is stored:You are responsible for uploading your app content to blob storage. You may use any blob storage account, though Azure Blob Storage is recommended.

### Docker container

You can deploy a function app running in a Linux container.


How to use it:[Create your functions in a Linux container]then deploy the container to a Premium or Dedicated plan in Azure Functions or another container host. Use the[Azure Functions Core Tools]to create a customized Dockerfile for your project that you use to build a containerized function app. You can use the container in the following deployments:

- Deploy to Azure Functions resources you create in the Azure portal. For more information, see
[Azure portal create using containers].- Deploy to Azure Functions resources you create from the command line. Requires either a Premium or Dedicated (App Service) plan. To learn how, see
[Create your first containerized Azure Functions].- Deploy to Azure Container Apps. To learn how, see
[Create your first containerized Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps].- Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy to a cluster using
[Azure Functions Core Tools]. Use the[command.]`func kubernetes deploy`


When to use it:Use the Docker container option when you need more control over the Linux environment where your function app runs and where the container is hosted. This deployment mechanism is available only for functions running on Linux.


Where app content is stored:You store app content in the specified container registry as a part of the image.

### Source control

You can enable continuous integration between your function app and a source code repository. When you enable source control, an update to code in the connected source repository triggers deployment of the latest code from the repository. For more information, see the [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](functions-continuous-deployment).


How to use it:The easiest way to set up publishing from source control is from the Deployment Center in the Functions area of the portal. For more information, see[Continuous deployment for Azure Functions].


When to use it:Using source control is the best practice for teams that collaborate on their function apps. Source control is a good deployment option that enables more sophisticated deployment pipelines. Usually, you enable source control on a staging slot, which you can swap into production after validation of updates from the repository. For more information, see[Azure Functions deployment slots].


Where app content is stored:The source control system stores the app content. The app file system stores a locally cloned and built app content form, which Azure Files from the storage account specified when the function app was created might back.

### Local Git

Use local Git to push code from your local machine to Azure Functions by using Git.


How to use it:Follow the instructions in[Local Git deployment to Azure App Service].


When to use it:To reduce the chance of errors, avoid using deployment methods that require the additional step of[manually syncing triggers]. Use[zip deployment]when possible.


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system, which might be backed by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app.

### FTP/S

You can use FTP/S to directly transfer files to Azure Functions, but don't use this deployment method. When you aren't planning on using FTP, disable it. If you choose to use FTP, enforce FTPS. To learn how in the Azure portal, see [Enforce FTPS](../app-service/deploy-ftp#enforce-ftps).


How to use it:Follow the instructions in[FTPS deployment settings]to get the URL and credentials you can use to deploy to your function app by using FTPS.


When to use it:To reduce the chance of errors, avoid using deployment methods that require the additional step of[manually syncing triggers]. Use[zip deployment]when possible.


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system. FTP/FTPS deployments fail when your app's file system is backed by Azure Files in the default host storage account. FTP/FTPS fails with Azure Files as mounted storage because of[FTP limitations].

### Portal editing

In the portal-based editor, you can directly edit the files that are in your function app (essentially deploying every time you save your changes).


How to use it:To edit your functions in the[Azure portal], you must[create your functions in the portal]. To preserve a single source of truth, using any other deployment method makes your function read-only and prevents continued portal editing. To return to a state in which you can edit your files in the Azure portal, you can manually turn the edit mode back to`Read/Write`

and remove any deployment-related application settings (like[).]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`


When to use it:The portal is a good way to get started with Azure Functions. Because of[development limitations in the Azure portal], you should use one of the following client tools for more advanced development work:


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system, which might be backed by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app.

## Deployment behaviors

When you deploy updates to your function app code, the deployment behavior depends on your hosting plan:

**Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated plans:** Currently executing functions are terminated when new code is deployed. After deployment completes, the new code is loaded to begin processing requests. This forceful termination behavior is known as a recreate strategy. For near zero-downtime deployments on Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated plans, use [deployment slots](#deployment-slots).

Review [Improve the performance and reliability of Azure Functions](performance-reliability#write-functions-to-be-stateless) to learn how to write stateless and defensive functions.

**Flex Consumption plan:** The default behavior also uses the recreate strategy, terminating currently executing functions during deployment. However, Flex Consumption uniquely supports two different site update strategies. You can [configure rolling updates](flex-consumption-site-updates) for zero-downtime deployments.

## Deployment slots

When you deploy your function app to Azure, you can deploy to a separate deployment slot instead of directly to production. Deploying to a deployment slot and then swapping into production after verification is the recommended way to configure [continuous deployment](functions-continuous-deployment).

The way that you deploy to a slot depends on the specific deployment tool you use. For example, when using Azure Functions Core Tools, you include the `--slot`

option to indicate the name of a specific slot for the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-functionapp-publish) command.

For more information on deployment slots, see the [Azure Functions Deployment Slots](functions-deployment-slots) documentation.

# Work with access keys in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions lets you use secret keys to make it more difficult to access your function endpoints. This article describes the kinds of access keys that Functions supports, and how to work with access keys.

While access keys provide some mitigation against unwanted access, you should consider other options to secure HTTP endpoints in production. For example, it's not a good practice to distribute shared secrets in a public app. If your function is being called from a public client, you should consider implementing these or other security mechanisms:

[Enable App Service Authentication/Authorization](security-concepts#enable-app-service-authenticationauthorization)[Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests](security-concepts#use-azure-api-management-apim-to-authenticate-requests)[Deploy your function app to a virtual network](security-concepts#deploy-your-function-app-to-a-virtual-network)[Deploy your function app in isolation](security-concepts#deploy-your-function-app-in-isolation)

Access keys provide the basis for HTTP authorization in HTTP triggered functions. For more information, see [Authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth).

## Understand keys

The scope of an access key and the actions it supports depend on the type of access key.

| Key type | Key name | HTTP auth level | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
Function |
`default` or user defined |
`function` |
Allows access only to a specific function endpoint. |
Host |
`default` or user defined |
`function` |
Allows access to all function endpoints in a function app. |
Master |
`_master` |
`admin` |
Special host key that also provides administrative access to the runtime REST APIs in a function app. Because the master key grants elevated permissions in your function app, you shouldn't share this key with third parties or distribute it in native client applications. |
System |
Depends on the extension | n/a | Specific extensions might require a system-managed key to access webhook endpoints. System keys are designed for extension-specific function endpoints that get called by internal components. For example, the
Only specific extensions can create system keys. You can't explicitly set their values. Like other keys, you can generate a new value for the key from the portal or by using the key APIs. |

Each key is named for reference. There's a default key (named `default`

) at the function and host level. Function keys take precedence over host keys. When two keys are defined with the same name, the function key is always used.

The following table compares the uses for various kinds of access keys:

| Action | Scope | Key type |
|---|---|---|
| Execute a function | Specific function | Function |
| Execute a function | Any function | Function or host |
Call an `admin` endpoint |
Function app | Master-only |
| Call Durable Task extension APIs | Function app* |
System |
| Call an extension-specific Webhook (internal) | Function app* |
system |

*Scope determined by the extension.

## Key requirements

In Functions, access keys are randomly generated 32-byte arrays that are encoded as URL-safe base-64 strings. While you can generate your own access keys and use them with Functions, we strongly recommend that you instead allow Functions to generate all of your access keys for you.

Functions-generated access keys include special signature and checksum values that indicate the type of access key and that Azure Functions generated it. Having these extra components in the key itself makes it much easier to determine the source of these kinds of secrets located during security scanning and other automated processes.

To allow Functions to generate your keys for you, don't supply the key `value`

to any of the APIs that you can use to generate keys.

## Manage key storage

Keys are stored as part of your function app in Azure and are encrypted at rest. By default, keys are stored in a Blob storage container in the account provided by the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting. You can use the [ AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobssecretstoragetype) setting to override this default behavior and instead store keys in one of these alternate locations:

| Location | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| A second storage account | `blob` |
Stores keys in Blob storage in a storage account that's different than the one used by the Functions runtime. The specific account and container used are defined by a shared access signature (SAS) URL set in the
`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageSas` |

`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageSas`

setting when the SAS URL changes.[Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview)`keyvault`

[is used to store keys.](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobssecretstoragekeyvaulturi)`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageKeyVaultUri`

`files`

`kubernetes`

[AzureWebJobsKubernetesSecretName](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobskubernetessecretname)is used to store keys. Supported only when your function app is deployed to Kubernetes. The[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)generates the values automatically when you use it to deploy your app to a Kubernetes cluster.[Immutable secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-immutable)aren't supported.`ContainerApps`

When you use Key Vault for key storage, the app settings you need depend on the managed identity type, either system-assigned or user-assigned.

| Setting name | System-assigned | User-assigned | App registration |
|---|---|---|---|
|

[AzureWebJobsSecretStorageKeyVaultClientId](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobssecretstoragekeyvaultclientid)[AzureWebJobsSecretStorageKeyVaultClientSecret](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobssecretstoragekeyvaultclientsecret)[AzureWebJobsSecretStorageKeyVaultTenantId](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobssecretstoragekeyvaulttenantid)Important

Secrets aren't scoped to individual function apps through the `AzureWebJobsSecretStorageKeyVaultUri`

setting. If multiple function apps are configured to use the same Key Vault they share the same secrets, potentially leading to key collisions or overwrites. To avoid unintended behavior, we recommend that you use a separate Key Vault instance for each function app.

## Use access keys

HTTP triggered functions can generally be called by using a URL that includes the function name. When the authorization level of a given function is set as a value other than `anonymous`

, you must also provide an access key in your request. The access key can either be provided in the URL using the `?code=`

query string or in the request header (`x-functions-key`

). For more information, see [Access key authorization](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#api-key-authorization).

To access the runtime REST APIs (under `/admin/`

), you must provide the master key (`_master`

) in the `x-functions-key`

request header. You can [remove the admin endpoints](security-concepts#disable-administrative-endpoints) using the `functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled`

site property.

## Get your function access keys

You can get function and host keys programmatically by using these Azure Resource Manager APIs:

To learn how to call Azure Resource Manager APIs, see the [Azure REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

You can use these methods to get access keys without having to use the REST APIs.

Sign in to the Azure portal, then search for and select

**Function App**.Select the function app you want to work with.

In the left menu, expand

**Functions**, and then select**App keys**.The

**App keys**page appears.  the host keys are displayed, which can be used to access any function in the app. The system key is also displayed, which gives anyone administrator-level access to all function app APIs.

You can also practice least privilege by using the key for a specific function. You can get function-specific keys from the **Function keys** tab of a specific HTTP-triggered function.

Tip

You can also obtain access keys for your functions by using the Azure Functions Core Tools command `func azure functionapp list-functions`

with the `--show-keys`

option. For more information, see the [Azure Functions Core Tools reference](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-functionapp-list-functions).

## Renew or create access keys

When you renew or create your access key values, you must manually redistribute the updated key values to all clients that call your function.

You can renew function and host keys programmatically or create new ones by using these Azure Resource Manager APIs:

[Create Or Update Function Secret](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/createorupdatefunctionsecret)[Create Or Update Function Secret Slot](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/createorupdatefunctionsecretslot)[Create Or Update Host Secret](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/createorupdatehostsecret)[Create Or Update Host Secret Slot](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/createorupdatehostsecretslot)

To learn how to call Azure Resource Manager APIs, see the [Azure REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

You can use these methods to get access keys without having to manually create calls to the REST APIs.

Sign in to the Azure portal, then search for and select

**Function App**.Select the function app you want to work with.

In the left menu, expand

**Functions**, and then select**App keys**.The

**App keys**page appears.  the host keys are displayed, which can be used to access any function in the app. The system key is also displayed, which gives anyone administrator-level access to all function app APIs.Select

**Renew key value**next to the key you want to renew, then select**Renew and save**.

You can also renew a function key in the **Function keys** tab of a specific HTTP-triggered function.

## Delete access keys

You can delete function and host keys programmatically by using these Azure Resource Manager APIs:

To learn how to call Azure Resource Manager APIs, see the [Azure REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

# Apache Kafka bindings for Azure Functions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Kafka extension for Azure Functions enables you to write values to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topics by using an output binding. You can also use a trigger to invoke your functions in response to messages in Kafka topics.

Important

Kafka bindings are available for Functions on the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium Plan](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan). They are only supported on version 4.x of the Functions runtime.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Run a function based on a new Kafka event. |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-kafka-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions run in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kafka).

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Enable runtime scaling

To allow your functions to scale properly on the Premium plan when using Kafka triggers and bindings, you need to enable runtime scale monitoring.

In the Azure portal, in your function app, select

**Configuration**.On the

**Function runtime settings**tab, for**Runtime Scale Monitoring**, select**On**.

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding in versions 3.x and higher. Settings in the host.json file apply to all functions in a function app instance. For more information about function app configuration settings in versions 3.x and later versions, see the [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"kafka": {
"maxBatchSize": 64,
"SubscriberIntervalInSeconds": 1,
"ExecutorChannelCapacity": 1,
"ChannelFullRetryIntervalInMs": 50
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ChannelFullRetryIntervalInMs | 50 | Trigger | Defines the subscriber retry interval, in milliseconds, used when attempting to add items to an at-capacity channel. |
| ExecutorChannelCapacity | 1 | Both | Defines the channel message capacity. Once capacity is reached, the Kafka subscriber pauses until the function catches up. |
| MaxBatchSize | 64 | Trigger | Maximum batch size when calling a Kafka triggered function. |
| SubscriberIntervalInSeconds | 1 | Trigger | Defines the minimum frequency incoming messages are executed, per function in seconds. Only when the message volume is less than `MaxBatchSize` / `SubscriberIntervalInSeconds` |

The following properties, which are inherited from the [Apache Kafka C/C++ client library](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md), are also supported in the `kafka`

section of host.json, for either triggers or both output bindings and triggers:

| Property | Applies to | librdkafka equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| AutoCommitIntervalMs | Trigger | `auto.commit.interval.ms` |
| AutoOffsetReset | Trigger | `auto.offset.reset` |
| FetchMaxBytes | Trigger | `fetch.max.bytes` |
| LibkafkaDebug | Both | `debug` |
| MaxPartitionFetchBytes | Trigger | `max.partition.fetch.bytes` |
| MaxPollIntervalMs | Trigger | `max.poll.interval.ms` |
| MetadataMaxAgeMs | Both | `metadata.max.age.ms` |
| QueuedMinMessages | Trigger | `queued.min.messages` |
| QueuedMaxMessagesKbytes | Trigger | `queued.max.messages.kbytes` |
| ReconnectBackoffMs | Trigger | `reconnect.backoff.max.ms` |
| ReconnectBackoffMaxMs | Trigger | `reconnect.backoff.max.ms` |
| SessionTimeoutMs | Trigger | `session.timeout.ms` |
| SocketKeepaliveEnable | Both | `socket.keepalive.enable` |
| StatisticsIntervalMs | Trigger | `statistics.interval.ms` |

# Frequently asked questions about networking in Azure Functions

This article lists frequently asked questions about networking in Azure Functions. For a more comprehensive overview, see [Functions networking options](functions-networking-options).

## How do I set a static IP in Functions?

Deploying a function in an App Service Environment is the primary way to have static inbound and outbound IP addresses for your functions. For details on using an App Service Environment, start with the article [Create and use an internal load balancer with an App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase).

You can also use a virtual network NAT gateway to route outbound traffic through a public IP address that you control. To learn more, see [Tutorial: Control Azure Functions outbound IP with an Azure virtual network NAT gateway](functions-how-to-use-nat-gateway).

## How do I restrict internet access to my function?

You can restrict internet access in a couple of ways:

[Private endpoints](functions-networking-options#private-endpoints): Restrict inbound traffic to your function app by private link over your virtual network, effectively blocking inbound traffic from the public internet.[IP restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions): Restrict inbound traffic to your function app by IP range.- Under IP restrictions, you are also able to configure
[Service Endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview), which restrict your Function to only accept inbound traffic from a particular virtual network.

- Under IP restrictions, you are also able to configure
- Removal of all HTTP triggers. For some applications, it's enough to simply avoid HTTP triggers and use any other event source to trigger your function.

Keep in mind that the Azure portal editor requires direct access to your running function. Any code changes through the Azure portal will require the device you're using to browse the portal to have its IP added to the approved list. But you can still use anything under the platform features tab with network restrictions in place.

## How do I restrict my function app to a virtual network?

You are able to restrict **inbound** traffic for a function app to a virtual network using [Service Endpoints](functions-networking-options#use-service-endpoints). This configuration still allows the function app to make outbound calls to the internet.

To completely restrict a function such that all traffic flows through a virtual network, you can use a [private endpoints](functions-networking-options#private-endpoints) with outbound virtual network integration or an App Service Environment. To learn more, see [Integrate Azure Functions with an Azure virtual network by using private endpoints](functions-create-vnet).

## How can I access resources in a virtual network from a function app?

You can access resources in a virtual network from a running function by using virtual network integration. For more information, see [Virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#virtual-network-integration).

## How do I access resources protected by service endpoints?

By using virtual network integration you can access service-endpoint-secured resources from a running function. For more information, see [virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#virtual-network-integration).

## How can I trigger a function from a resource in a virtual network?

You are able to allow HTTP triggers to be called from a virtual network using [Service Endpoints](functions-networking-options#use-service-endpoints) or [Private Endpoint connections](functions-networking-options#private-endpoints).

You can also trigger a function from all other resources in a virtual network by deploying your function app to a Premium plan, App Service plan, or App Service Environment. See [non-HTTP virtual network triggers](functions-networking-options#virtual-network-triggers-non-http)
for more information

## How can I deploy my function app in a virtual network?

Deploying to an App Service Environment is the only way to create a function app that's wholly inside a virtual network. For details on using an internal load balancer with an App Service Environment, start with the article [Create and use an internal load balancer with an App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase).

For scenarios where you need only one-way access to virtual network resources, or less comprehensive network isolation, see the [Functions networking overview](functions-networking-options).

## Next steps

# Azure Functions HTTP trigger

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The HTTP trigger lets you invoke a function with an HTTP request. You can use an HTTP trigger to build serverless APIs and respond to webhooks.

The default return value for an HTTP-triggered function is:

`HTTP 204 No Content`

with an empty body in Functions 2.x and higher`HTTP 200 OK`

with an empty body in Functions 1.x

To modify the HTTP response, configure an [output binding](functions-bindings-http-webhook-output).

For more information about HTTP bindings, see the [overview](functions-bindings-http-webhook) and [output binding reference](functions-bindings-http-webhook-output).

Tip

If you plan to use the HTTP or WebHook bindings, plan to avoid port exhaustion that can be caused by improper instantiation of `HttpClient`

. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

The code in this article defaults to .NET Core syntax, used in Functions version 2.x and higher. For information on the 1.x syntax, see the [1.x functions templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-templates/tree/v1.x/Functions.Templates/Templates).

The following example shows an HTTP trigger that returns a "hello, world" response as an [IActionResult](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.iactionresult), using [ASP.NET Core integration in .NET Isolated](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration):

```
[Function("HttpFunction")]
public IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get")] HttpRequest req)
{
return new OkObjectResult($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");
}
```


The following example shows an HTTP trigger that returns a "hello world" response as an [HttpResponseData](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.http.httpresponsedata) object:

```
[Function(nameof(HttpFunction))]
public static HttpResponseData Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequestData req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
var logger = executionContext.GetLogger(nameof(HttpFunction));
logger.LogInformation("message logged");
var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8");
response.WriteString("Welcome to .NET isolated worker !!");
return response;
}
```


This section contains the following examples:

[Read parameter from the query string](#read-parameter-from-the-query-string)[Read body from a POST request](#read-body-from-a-post-request)[Read parameter from a route](#read-parameter-from-a-route)[Read POJO body from a POST request](#read-pojo-body-from-a-post-request)

The following examples show the HTTP trigger binding.

#### Read parameter from the query string

This example reads a parameter, named `id`

, from the query string, and uses it to build a JSON document returned to the client, with content type `application/json`

.

```
@FunctionName("TriggerStringGet")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("GET parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
// Get named parameter
String id = request.getQueryParameters().getOrDefault("id", "");
// Convert and display
if (id.isEmpty()) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from to the client
// Generate document
final String name = "fake_name";
final String jsonDocument = "{\"id\":\"" + id + "\", " +
"\"description\": \"" + name + "\"}";
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(jsonDocument)
.build();
}
}
```


#### Read body from a POST request

This example reads the body of a POST request, as a `String`

, and uses it to build a JSON document returned to the client, with content type `application/json`

.

```
@FunctionName("TriggerStringPost")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Request body is: " + request.getBody().orElse(""));
// Check request body
if (!request.getBody().isPresent()) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from to the client
// Generate document
final String body = request.getBody().get();
final String jsonDocument = "{\"id\":\"123456\", " +
"\"description\": \"" + body + "\"}";
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(jsonDocument)
.build();
}
}
```


#### Read parameter from a route

This example reads a mandatory parameter, named `id`

, and an optional parameter `name`

from the route path, and uses them to build a JSON document returned to the client, with content type `application/json`

.

```
@FunctionName("TriggerStringRoute")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS,
route = "trigger/{id}/{name=EMPTY}") // name is optional and defaults to EMPTY
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@BindingName("id") String id,
@BindingName("name") String name,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Route parameters are: " + id);
// Convert and display
if (id == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from to the client
// Generate document
final String jsonDocument = "{\"id\":\"" + id + "\", " +
"\"description\": \"" + name + "\"}";
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(jsonDocument)
.build();
}
}
```


#### Read POJO body from a POST request

Here's the code for the `ToDoItem`

class, referenced in this example:

```
public class ToDoItem {
private String id;
private String description;
public ToDoItem(String id, String description) {
this.id = id;
this.description = description;
}
public String getId() {
return id;
}
public String getDescription() {
return description;
}
@Override
public String toString() {
return "ToDoItem={id=" + id + ",description=" + description + "}";
}
}
```


This example reads the body of a POST request. The request body gets automatically de-serialized into a `ToDoItem`

object, and is returned to the client, with content type `application/json`

. The `ToDoItem`

parameter is serialized by the Functions runtime as it is assigned to the `body`

property of the `HttpMessageResponse.Builder`

class.

```
@FunctionName("TriggerPojoPost")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<ToDoItem>> request,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Request body is: " + request.getBody().orElse(null));
// Check request body
if (!request.getBody().isPresent()) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from to the client
// Generate document
final ToDoItem body = request.getBody().get();
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(body)
.build();
}
}
```


The following example shows an HTTP trigger [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript). The function looks for a `name`

parameter either in the query string or the body of the [HTTP request](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript&pivots=nodejs-model-v4#http-request).

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


The following example shows an HTTP trigger [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node). The function looks for a `name`

parameter either in the query string or the body of the [HTTP request](functions-reference-node?tabs=javascript&pivots=nodejs-model-v4#http-request).

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
},
});
```


The following example shows a trigger binding in a *function.json* file and a [PowerShell function](functions-reference-powershell). The function looks for a `name`

parameter either in the query string or the body of the HTTP request.

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
}
]
}
```


```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$name = $Request.Query.Name
if (-not $name) {
$name = $Request.Body.Name
}
$body = "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response."
if ($name) {
$body = "Hello, $name. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
}
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
Body = $body
})
```


This example is an HTTP triggered function that uses [HTTP streams](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=python-v2&pivots=programming-language-python#http-streams-1) to return chunked response data. You might use these capabilities to support scenarios like sending event data through a pipeline for real time visualization or detecting anomalies in large sets of data and providing instant notifications.

```
import time
import azure.functions as func
from azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi import Request, StreamingResponse
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
def generate_sensor_data():
"""Generate real-time sensor data."""
for i in range(10):
# Simulate temperature and humidity readings
temperature = 20 + i
humidity = 50 + i
yield f"data: {{'temperature': {temperature}, 'humidity': {humidity}}}\n\n"
time.sleep(1)
@app.route(route="stream", methods=[func.HttpMethod.GET])
async def stream_sensor_data(req: Request) -> StreamingResponse:
"""Endpoint to stream real-time sensor data."""
return StreamingResponse(generate_sensor_data(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```


To learn more, including how to enable HTTP streams in your project, see [HTTP streams](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=python-v2&pivots=programming-language-python#http-streams-1).

This example shows a trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. The function looks for a `name`

parameter either in the query string or the body of the HTTP request.

```
import azure.functions as func
import logging
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="HttpTrigger1")
@app.route(route="hello", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
def test_function(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
return func.HttpResponse(
"This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.",
status_code=200
)
```


## Attributes

Both the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) and the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library) use the `HttpTriggerAttribute`

to define the trigger binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#http-trigger).

In [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) function apps, the `HttpTriggerAttribute`

supports the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
AuthLevel |
Determines what keys, if any, need to be present on the request in order to invoke the function. For supported values, see
|

**Methods**[customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).**Route**`<functionname>`

. For more information, see [customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties for a trigger are defined in the `route`

decorator, which adds HttpTrigger and HttpOutput binding:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`route` |
Route for the http endpoint. If None, it will be set to function name if present or user-defined python function name. |
`trigger_arg_name` |
Argument name for HttpRequest. The default value is 'req'. |
`binding_arg_name` |
Argument name for HttpResponse. The default value is '$return'. |
`methods` |
A tuple of the HTTP methods to which the function responds. |
`auth_level` |
Determines what keys, if any, need to be present on the request in order to invoke the function. |

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [HttpTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.httptrigger) annotation, which supports the following settings:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `app.http()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
authLevel |
Determines what keys, if any, need to be present on the request in order to invoke the function. For supported values, see
|

**methods**[customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).**route**`<functionname>`

. For more information, see [customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).The following table explains the trigger configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, which differs by runtime version.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Required - must be set to `httpTrigger` . |
direction |
Required - must be set to `in` . |
name |
Required - the variable name used in function code for the request or request body. |
authLevel |
Determines what keys, if any, need to be present on the request in order to invoke the function. For supported values, see
|

**methods**[customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).**route**`<functionname>`

. For more information, see [customize the HTTP endpoint](#customize-the-http-endpoint).## Usage

This section details how to configure your HTTP trigger function binding.

The [HttpTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.httptrigger) annotation should be applied to a method parameter of one of the following types:

[HttpRequestMessage<T>](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.httprequestmessage).- Any native Java types such as int, String, byte[].
- Nullable values using Optional.
- Any plain-old Java object (POJO) type.

### Payload

The trigger input type is declared as one of the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|

*Use of this type requires that the app is configured with*[ASP.NET Core integration in .NET Isolated](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration).This gives you full access to the request object and overall HttpContext.

[HttpRequestData](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.functions.worker.http.httprequestdata)When the trigger parameter is of type `HttpRequestData`

or `HttpRequest`

, custom types can also be bound to other parameters using `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http.FromBodyAttribute`

. Use of this attribute requires [ Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http version 3.1.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http). This is a different type than the similar attribute in

`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`

. When using ASP.NET Core integration, you need a fully qualified reference or `using`

statement. This example shows how to use the attribute to get just the body contents while still having access to the full `HttpRequest`

, using ASP.NET Core integration:```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
namespace AspNetIntegration
{
public class BodyBindingHttpTrigger
{
[Function(nameof(BodyBindingHttpTrigger))]
public IActionResult Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post")] HttpRequest req,
[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http.FromBody] Person person)
{
return new OkObjectResult(person);
}
}
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
}
```


### Customize the HTTP endpoint

By default when you create a function for an HTTP trigger, the function is addressable with a route of the form:

```
https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>
```


You can customize this route using the optional `route`

property on the HTTP trigger's input binding. You can use any [ASP.NET Core Route Constraint](/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#route-constraints) with your parameters.

The following function code accepts two parameters `category`

and `id`

in the route and writes a response using both parameters.

```
[Function("HttpTrigger1")]
public static HttpResponseData Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post",
Route = "products/{category:alpha}/{id:int?}")] HttpRequestData req, string category, int? id,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
var logger = executionContext.GetLogger("HttpTrigger1");
logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
var message = String.Format($"Category: {category}, ID: {id}");
var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8");
response.WriteString(message);
return response;
}
```


Route parameters are defined using the `route`

setting of the `HttpTrigger`

annotation. The following function code accepts two parameters `category`

and `id`

in the route and writes a response using both parameters.

```
package com.function;
import java.util.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
public class HttpTriggerJava {
public HttpResponseMessage<String> HttpTrigger(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {"get"},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION,
route = "products/{category:alpha}/{id:int}") HttpRequestMessage<String> request,
@BindingName("category") String category,
@BindingName("id") int id,
final ExecutionContext context) {
String message = String.format("Category %s, ID: %d", category, id);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body(message).build();
}
}
```


As an example, the following TypeScript code defines a `route`

property for an HTTP trigger with two parameters, `category`

and `id`

. The example reads the parameters from the request and returns their values in the response.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const category = request.params.category;
const id = request.params.id;
return { body: `Category: ${category}, ID: ${id}` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
route: 'products/{category:alpha}/{id:int?}',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


As an example, the following JavaScript code defines a `route`

property for an HTTP trigger with two parameters, `category`

and `id`

. The example reads the parameters from the request and returns their values in the response.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
route: 'products/{category:alpha}/{id:int?}',
handler: async (request, context) => {
const category = request.params.category;
const id = request.params.id;
return { body: `Category: ${category}, ID: ${id}` };
},
});
```


As an example, the following code defines a `route`

property for an HTTP trigger with two parameters, `category`

and `id`

:

Route parameters declared in the *function.json* file are accessible as a property of the `$Request.Params`

object.

```
$Category = $Request.Params.category
$Id = $Request.Params.id
$Message = "Category:" + $Category + ", ID: " + $Id
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
Body = $Message
})
```


The function execution context is exposed via a parameter declared as `func.HttpRequest`

. This instance allows a function to access data route parameters, query string values and methods that allow you to return HTTP responses.

Once defined, the route parameters are available to the function by calling the `route_params`

method.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
category = req.route_params.get('category')
id = req.route_params.get('id')
message = f"Category: {category}, ID: {id}"
return func.HttpResponse(message)
```


Using this configuration, the function is now addressable with the following route instead of the original route.

```
https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/products/electronics/357
```


This configuration allows the function code to support two parameters in the address, *category* and *ID*. For more information on how route parameters are tokenized in a URL, see [Routing in ASP.NET Core](/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing#route-constraint-reference).

By default, all function routes are prefixed with `api`

. You can also customize or remove the prefix using the `extensions.http.routePrefix`

property in your [host.json](functions-host-json) file. The following example removes the `api`

route prefix by using an empty string for the prefix in the *host.json* file.

```
{
"extensions": {
"http": {
"routePrefix": ""
}
}
}
```


### Using route parameters

Route parameters that defined a function's `route`

pattern are available to each binding. For example, if you have a route defined as `"route": "products/{id}"`

then a table storage binding can use the value of the `{id}`

parameter in the binding configuration.

The following configuration shows how the `{id}`

parameter is passed to the binding's `rowKey`

.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, input, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
const tableInput = input.table({
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
partitionKey: 'products',
tableName: 'products',
rowKey: '{id}',
});
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
return { jsonBody: context.extraInputs.get(tableInput) };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
route: 'products/{id}',
extraInputs: [tableInput],
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


```
const { app, input } = require('@azure/functions');
const tableInput = input.table({
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
partitionKey: 'products',
tableName: 'products',
rowKey: '{id}',
});
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
route: 'products/{id}',
extraInputs: [tableInput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
return { jsonBody: context.extraInputs.get(tableInput) };
},
});
```


```
{
"type": "table",
"direction": "in",
"name": "product",
"partitionKey": "products",
"tableName": "products",
"rowKey": "{id}"
}
```


When you use route parameters, an `invoke_URL_template`

is automatically created for your function. Your clients can use the URL template to understand the parameters they need to pass in the URL when calling your function using its URL. Navigate to one of your HTTP-triggered functions in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Get function URL**.

You can programmatically access the `invoke_URL_template`

by using the Azure Resource Manager APIs for [List Functions](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/listfunctions) or [Get Function](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/webapps/getfunction).

### HTTP streams

You can now stream requests to and responses from your HTTP endpoint in Node.js v4 function apps. For more information, see [HTTP streams](functions-reference-node?pivots=nodejs-model-v4#http-streams).

### HTTP streams

HTTP streams support in Python lets you accept and return data from your HTTP endpoints using FastAPI request and response APIs enabled in your functions. These APIs enable the host to process data in HTTP messages as chunks instead of having to read an entire message into memory.

### Prerequisites

[Azure Functions runtime](functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-python)version 4.34.1, or a later version.[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)version 3.8, or a later[supported version](functions-reference-python?tabs=get-started&pivots=python-mode-decorators#supported-python-versions).

Important

HTTP streams is only supported for the Python v2 programming model.

### Enable HTTP streams

HTTP streams are disabled by default. You need to enable this feature in your application settings and also update your code to use the FastAPI package. Note that when enabling HTTP streams, the function app will default to using HTTP streaming, and the original HTTP functionality will not work.

Add the

`azurefunctions-extensions-http-fastapi`

extension package to the`requirements.txt`

file in the project, which should include at least these packages:`azure-functions azurefunctions-extensions-http-fastapi`

Add this code to the

`function_app.py`

file in the project, which imports the FastAPI extension:`from azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi import Request, StreamingResponse`

When you deploy to Azure, add the following

[application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings)in your function app:`"PYTHON_ENABLE_INIT_INDEXING": "1"`

When running locally, you also need to add these same settings to the

`local.settings.json`

project file.

### HTTP streams examples

After you enable the HTTP streaming feature, you can create functions that stream data over HTTP.

This example is an HTTP triggered function that receives and processes streaming data from a client in real time. It demonstrates streaming upload capabilities that can be helpful for scenarios like processing continuous data streams and handling event data from IoT devices.

```
import azure.functions as func
from azurefunctions.extensions.http.fastapi import JSONResponse, Request
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
@app.route(route="streaming_upload", methods=[func.HttpMethod.POST])
async def streaming_upload(req: Request) -> JSONResponse:
"""Handle streaming upload requests."""
# Process each chunk of data as it arrives
async for chunk in req.stream():
process_data_chunk(chunk)
# Once all data is received, return a JSON response indicating successful processing
return JSONResponse({"status": "Data uploaded and processed successfully"})
def process_data_chunk(chunk: bytes):
"""Process each data chunk."""
# Add custom processing logic here
pass
```


### Calling HTTP streams

You must use an HTTP client library to make streaming calls to a function's FastAPI endpoints. The client tool or browser you're using might not natively support streaming or could only return the first chunk of data.

You can use a client script like this to send streaming data to an HTTP endpoint:

```
import httpx # Be sure to add 'httpx' to 'requirements.txt'
import asyncio
async def stream_generator(file_path):
chunk_size = 2 * 1024 # Define your own chunk size
with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
while chunk := file.read(chunk_size):
yield chunk
print(f"Sent chunk: {len(chunk)} bytes")
async def stream_to_server(url, file_path):
timeout = httpx.Timeout(60.0, connect=60.0)
async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=timeout) as client:
response = await client.post(url, content=stream_generator(file_path))
return response
async def stream_response(response):
if response.status_code == 200:
async for chunk in response.aiter_raw():
print(f"Received chunk: {len(chunk)} bytes")
else:
print(f"Error: {response}")
async def main():
print('helloworld')
# Customize your streaming endpoint served from core tool in variable 'url' if different.
url = 'http://localhost:7071/api/streaming_upload'
file_path = r'<file path>'
response = await stream_to_server(url, file_path)
print(response)
if __name__ == "__main__":
asyncio.run(main())
```


Important

If you are using HTTP streams, all HTTP functions in the app need to use streaming. Combining streaming and non-streaming HTTP functions within the same app is not supported.

### Working with client identities

If your function app is using [App Service Authentication / Authorization](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization), you can view information about authenticated clients from your code. This information is available as [request headers injected by the platform](../app-service/configure-authentication-user-identities#access-user-claims-in-app-code).

You can also read this information from binding data.

Note

Access to authenticated client information is currently only available for .NET languages. It also isn't supported in version 1.x of the Functions runtime.

Information regarding authenticated clients is available as a [ClaimsPrincipal](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.claims.claimsprincipal), which is available as part of the request context as shown in the following example:

The authenticated user is available via [HTTP Headers](../app-service/configure-authentication-user-identities#access-user-claims-in-app-code).

The authenticated user is available via [HTTP Headers](../app-service/configure-authentication-user-identities#access-user-claims-in-app-code).

### Authorization level

The authorization level is a string value that indicates the kind of [authorization key](#authorization-keys) that's required to access the function endpoint. For an HTTP triggered function, the authorization level can be one of the following values:

| Level value | Description |
|---|---|
anonymous |
No access key is required. |
function |
A function-specific key is required to access the endpoint. |
admin |
The master key is required to access the endpoint. |

When a level isn't explicitly set, authorization defaults to the `function`

level.

When a level isn't explicitly set, the default authorization depends on the version of the Node.js model:

### Function access keys

Functions lets you use access keys to make it harder to access your function endpoints. Unless the authorization level on an HTTP triggered function is set to `anonymous`

, requests must include an access key in the request. For more information, see [Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to).

### Access key authorization

Most HTTP trigger templates require an access key in the request. So your HTTP request normally looks like the following URL:

```
https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>?code=<API_KEY>
```


Function apps that run in containers use the domain of the container host. For an example HTTP endpoint hosted in Azure Container Apps, see the example in [this Container Apps hosting article](functions-deploy-container-apps#verify-your-functions-on-azure).

The key can be included in a query string variable named `code`

, as mentioned earlier. It can also be included in an `x-functions-key`

HTTP header. The value of the key can be any function key defined for the function, or any host key.

You can allow anonymous requests, which don't require keys. You can also require that the master key is used. You change the default authorization level by using the `authLevel`

property in the binding JSON.

Note

When running functions locally, authorization is disabled regardless of the specified authorization level setting. After publishing to Azure, the `authLevel`

setting in your trigger is enforced. Keys are still required when running [locally in a container](functions-create-container-registry#build-the-container-image-and-verify-locally).

### Webhooks

Note

Webhook mode is only available for version 1.x of the Functions runtime. This change was made to improve the performance of HTTP triggers in version 2.x and higher.

In version 1.x, webhook templates provide another validation for webhook payloads. In version 2.x and higher, the base HTTP trigger still works and is the recommended approach for webhooks.

#### WebHook type

The `webHookType`

binding property indicates the type if webhook supported by the function, which also dictates the supported payload. The webhook type can be one of the following values:

| Type value | Description |
|---|---|
`genericJson` |
A general-purpose webhook endpoint without logic for a specific provider. This setting restricts requests to only those using HTTP POST and with the `application/json` content type. |
`github` |
The function responds to
`authLevel` property with GitHub webhooks. |

`slack`

[Slack webhooks](https://api.slack.com/outgoing-webhooks). Don't use the`authLevel`

property with Slack webhooks.When setting the `webHookType`

property, don't also set the `methods`

property on the binding.

#### GitHub webhooks

To respond to GitHub webhooks, first create your function with an HTTP Trigger, and set the **webHookType** property to `github`

. Then copy its URL and API key into the **Add webhook** page of your GitHub repository.

#### Slack webhooks

The Slack webhook generates a token for you instead of letting you specify it, so you must configure a function-specific key with the token from Slack. See [Authorization keys](#authorization-keys).

### Webhooks and keys

Webhook authorization is handled by the webhook receiver component, part of the HTTP trigger, and the mechanism varies based on the webhook type. Each mechanism does rely on a key. By default, the function key named "default" is used. To use a different key, configure the webhook provider to send the key name with the request in one of the following ways:

**Query string**: The provider passes the key name in the`clientid`

query string parameter, such as`https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/<FUNCTION_NAME>?clientid=<KEY_NAME>`

.**Request header**: The provider passes the key name in the`x-functions-clientid`

header.

## Invoke HTTP triggers

You can invoke your HTTP-triggered functions using an HTTP client. The examples in this section use [ curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), but you can use any HTTP client tool that keeps your data secure. For more information, see

[HTTP test tools](functions-develop-local#http-test-tools).

The request you need to make might be different between a local version of your code and when hosted in Azure. By default, when you run your project using the Azure Functions Core Tools, access key authorization requirements are removed. However, any requirements you've configured will still be enforced when hosted.

### Invoke locally

The [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-develop-local) registers a `localhost`

endpoint for your function app, which you can use to invoke your functions. During application startup, the specific port being used is displayed in the console. The output also lists the available functions, and for each HTTP-triggered function, the output also includes the function's route template.

Use this information to construct the URL to provide to your API client. You also need to specify any headers, parameters, and request body information your function requires. The following example sends an HTTP POST request with a JSON body:

```
curl --request POST http://localhost:7071/api/Function1 --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"message":"test data"}'
```


### Invoke in Azure

When invoking an HTTP-triggered function hosted in Azure, you need to consider your networking configuration. The HTTP client must have network access to the app, so if you have [inbound networking restrictions](functions-networking-options#inbound-networking-features) enabled, the client might need to be within a virtual network or specific IP ranges. Your domain configuration determines the base URL you need to use for the request.

Note

Newly created function apps can generate a unique default host name that uses the naming convention `<app-name>-<random-hash>.<region>.azurewebsites.net`

. An example is `myapp-ds27dh7271aah175.westus-01.azurewebsites.net`

. Existing app names remain unchanged.

For more information, see the [blog post about creating an app with a unique default host name](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/secure-unique-default-hostnames-ga-on-app-service-web-apps-and-public-preview-on/4303571).

Unless you selected the anonymous [authorization level](#http-auth) in your trigger definition, your request may also need to [include an access key](function-keys-how-to#use-access-keys).

The following example sends an HTTP POST request with a function body, including the access key in the query string:

```
curl --request POST "https://<your-function-app-base-url>/api/Function1?code=<your-function-key>" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"message":"test data"}'
```


## Content types

Passing binary and form data to a non-C# function requires that you use the appropriate content-type header. Supported content types include `octet-stream`

for binary data and [multipart types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#multipart).

#### Known issues

In non-C# functions, requests sent with the content-type `image/jpeg`

results in a `string`

value passed to the function. In cases like these, you can manually convert the `string`

value to a byte array to access the raw binary data.

### Limits

The HTTP request size and URL lengths are both limited based on [settings defined in the host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script.WebHost/web.config#L19). For more information, see [Service limits](functions-scale#service-limits).

If a function that uses the HTTP trigger doesn't complete within 230 seconds, the [Azure Load Balancer](../app-service/faq-availability-performance-application-issues#why-does-my-request-time-out-after-230-seconds-) will time out and return an HTTP 502 error. The function will continue running but will be unable to return an HTTP response. For long-running functions, we recommend that you follow async patterns and return a location where you can ping the status of the request. For information about how long a function can run, see [Scale and hosting - Consumption plan](functions-scale#timeout).

# Quickstart: Create and deploy Azure Functions resources from an ARM template

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to create a function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure, along with its required Azure resources. The function app provides a serverless execution context for your function code executions. The app uses Microsoft Entra ID with managed identities to connect to other Azure resources.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

An [Azure Resource Manager template](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. You describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template opens in the Azure portal.

After you create the function app, you can deploy your Azure Functions project code to that app. A final code deployment step is outside the scope of this quickstart article.

## Prerequisites

### Azure account

Before you begin, you must have an Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart Templates](/en-us/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/function-app-flex-managed-identities/).

This template creates these Azure resources needed by a function app that securely connects to Azure services:

: creates your function app.**Microsoft.Web/sites**: creates a serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan for your app.**Microsoft.Web/serverfarms**: creates an Azure Storage account, which is required by Functions.**Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts**: creates an Application Insights instance for monitoring your app.**Microsoft.Insights/components**: creates a workspace required by Application Insights.**Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces**: creates a user-assigned managed identity that's used by the app to authenticate with other Azure services using Microsoft Entra.**Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities**: creates role assignments to the user-assigned managed identity, which provide the app with least-privilege access when connecting to other Azure services.**Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments**

Deployment considerations:

- The storage account is used to store important app data, including the application code deployment package. This deployment creates a storage account that is accessed using Microsoft Entra ID authentication and managed identities. Identity access is granted on a least-permissions basis.
- The Bicep file defaults to creating a C# app that uses .NET 8 in an isolated process. For other languages, use the
`functionAppRuntime`

and`functionAppRuntimeVersion`

parameters to specify the specific language and version on which to run your app. Make sure to select your programming language at the[top](#top)of the article.

## Deploy the template

These scripts are designed for and tested in [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview). Choose **Try It** to open a Cloud Shell instance right in your browser. When prompted, enter the name of a region that [supports the Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-how-to#view-currently-supported-regions), such as `eastus`

or `northeurope`

.

```
read -p "Enter a supported Azure region: " location &&
resourceGroupName=exampleRG &&
templateUri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-flex-managed-identities/azuredeploy.json" &&
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri $templateUri --parameters functionAppRuntime=dotnet-isolated functionAppRuntimeVersion=8.0 &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
read
```


```
read -p "Enter a supported Azure region: " location &&
resourceGroupName=exampleRG &&
templateUri="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-flex-managed-identities/azuredeploy.json" &&
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri $templateUri --parameters functionAppRuntime=java functionAppRuntimeVersion=17 &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
read
```


```
read -p "Enter a supported Azure region: " location &&
resourceGroupName=exampleRG &&

az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri $templateUri --parameters functionAppRuntime=node functionAppRuntimeVersion=20 &&

az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri $templateUri --parameters functionAppRuntime=python functionAppRuntimeVersion=3.11 &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
read
```


```
read -p "Enter a supported Azure region: " location &&

az deployment group create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-uri $templateUri --parameters functionAppRuntime=powerShell functionAppRuntimeVersion=7.4 &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..." &&
read
```


When the deployment finishes, you should see a message indicating the deployment succeeded.

## Visit function app welcome page

Use the output from the previous validation step to retrieve the unique name created for your function app.

Open a browser and enter the following URL:

**<https://<appName.azurewebsites.net>**. Make sure to replace**<\appName>**with the unique name created for your function app.When you visit the URL, you should see a page like this:


## Clean up resources

Now that you have deployed a function app and related resources to Azure, can continue to the next step of publishing project code to your app. Otherwise, use these commands to delete the resources, when you no longer need them.

```
az group delete --name exampleRG
```


You can also remove resources by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Next steps

You can now deploy a code project to the function app resources you created in Azure.

You can create, verify, and deploy a code project to your new function app from these local environments:

# Azure Queue storage output bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can create new Azure Queue storage messages by setting up an output binding.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-storage-queue).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

```
[Function(nameof(QueueInputOutputFunction))]
[QueueOutput("output-queue")]
public string[] QueueInputOutputFunction([QueueTrigger("input-queue")] Album myQueueItem, FunctionContext context)
{
// Use a string array to return more than one message.
string[] messages = {
$"Album name = {myQueueItem.Name}",
$"Album songs = {myQueueItem.Songs}"};
_logger.LogInformation("{msg1},{msg2}", messages[0], messages[1]);
// Queue Output messages
return messages;
}
```


For an end-to-end example of how to configure an output binding to Queue storage, see one of these articles:

The following example shows a Java function that creates a queue message for when triggered by an HTTP request.

```
@FunctionName("httpToQueue")
@QueueOutput(name = "item", queueName = "myqueue-items", connection = "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting")
public String pushToQueue(
@HttpTrigger(name = "request", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
final String message,
@HttpOutput(name = "response") final OutputBinding<String> result) {
result.setValue(message + " has been added.");
return message;
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@QueueOutput`

annotation on parameters whose value would be written to Queue storage. The parameter type should be `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is any native Java type of a POJO.

For an end-to-end example of how to configure an output binding to Queue storage, see one of these articles:

The following example shows an HTTP triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that creates a queue item for each HTTP request received.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext, output } from '@azure/functions';
const queueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const body = await request.text();
context.extraOutputs.set(queueOutput, body);
return { body: 'Created queue item.' };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [queueOutput],
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
context.extraOutputs.set(queueOutput, ['message 1', 'message 2']);
```


The following example shows an HTTP triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that creates a queue item for each HTTP request received.

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const queueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [queueOutput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
const body = await request.text();
context.extraOutputs.set(queueOutput, body);
return { body: 'Created queue item.' };
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
context.extraOutputs.set(queueOutput, ['message 1', 'message 2']);
```


For an end-to-end example of how to configure an output binding to Queue storage, see one of these articles:

The following code examples demonstrate how to output a queue message from an HTTP-triggered function. The configuration section with the `type`

of `queue`

defines the output binding.

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "anonymous",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
},
{
"type": "queue",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Msg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting"
}
]
}
```


Using this binding configuration, a PowerShell function can create a queue message using `Push-OutputBinding`

. In this example, a message is created from a query string or body parameter.

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$message = $Request.Query.Message
Push-OutputBinding -Name Msg -Value $message
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = 200
Body = "OK"
})
```


To send multiple messages at once, define a message array and use `Push-OutputBinding`

to send messages to the Queue output binding.

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$message = @("message1", "message2")
Push-OutputBinding -Name Msg -Value $message
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = 200
Body = "OK"
})
```


For an end-to-end example of how to configure an output binding to Queue storage, see one of these articles:

The following example demonstrates how to output single and multiple values to storage queues. The configuration needed for *function.json* is the same either way. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="QueueOutput1")
@app.route(route="message")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg",
queue_name="<QUEUE_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
input_msg = req.params.get('name')
logging.info(input_msg)
msg.set(input_msg)
logging.info(f'name: {name}')
return 'OK'
```


For an end-to-end example of how to configure an output binding to Queue storage, see one of these articles:

## Attributes

The attribute that defines an output binding in C# libraries depends on the mode in which the C# class library runs.

When running in an isolated worker process, you use the [QueueOutputAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues/src/QueueOutputAttribute.cs), which takes the name of the queue, as shown in the following example:

```
[Function(nameof(QueueInputOutputFunction))]
[QueueOutput("output-queue")]
public string[] QueueInputOutputFunction([QueueTrigger("input-queue")] Album myQueueItem, FunctionContext context)
```


Only returned variables are supported when running in an isolated worker process. Output parameters can't be used.

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `queue_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the queue in function code. |
`queue_name` |
The name of the queue. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Queues. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The [QueueOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.queueoutput) annotation allows you to write a message as the output of a function. The following example shows an HTTP-triggered function that creates a queue message.

```
package com.function;
import java.util.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
public class HttpTriggerQueueOutput {
@FunctionName("HttpTriggerQueueOutput")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "message", queueName = "messages", connection = "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting") OutputBinding<String> message,
final ExecutionContext context) {
message.setValue(request.getQueryParameters().get("name"));
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Done").build();
}
}
```


| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`name` |
Declares the parameter name in the function signature. When the function is triggered, this parameter's value has the contents of the queue message. |
`queueName` |
Declares the queue name in the storage account. |
`connection` |
Points to the storage account connection string. |

The parameter associated with the [QueueOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.queueoutput) annotation is typed as an [OutputBinding<T>](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding) instance.

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.storageQueue()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
queueName |
The name of the queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Queues. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `queue` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the queue in function code. Set to `$return` to reference the function return value. |
queueName |
The name of the queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Queues. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The usage of the Queue output binding depends on the extension package version and the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see usage details for the mode and version.

When you want the function to write a single message, the queue output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message content as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the content of a JSON message. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the queue output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing content for multiple messages. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [QueueClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient) with other types from [Azure.Storage.Queues](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

There are two options for writing to a queue from a function by using the [QueueOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.queueoutput) annotation:

**Return value**: By applying the annotation to the function itself, the return value of the function is written to the queue.**Imperative**: To explicitly set the message value, apply the annotation to a specific parameter of the type, where`OutputBinding<T>`

`T`

is a POJO or any native Java type. With this configuration, passing a value to the`setValue`

method writes the value to the queue.

Output to the queue message is available via `Push-OutputBinding`

where you pass arguments that match the name designated by binding's `name`

parameter in the *function.json* file.

There are two options for writing from your function to the configured queue:

**Return value**: Set the`name`

property in*function.json*to`$return`

. With this configuration, the function's return value is persisted as a Queue storage message.**Imperative**: Pass a value to the[set](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out#set-val--t-----none)method of the parameter declared as an[Out](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out)type. The value passed to`set`

is persisted as a Queue storage message.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[func.QueueMessage]`

, `func.Out[str]`

, or `func.Out[bytes]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration that specifies how the app should connect to Azure Queues. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Manage storage account access keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage).

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name here. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyStorage", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyStorage." If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Storage connection string in the app setting that is named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-storage-queue#storage-extension-5x-and-higher) ([bundle 3.x or higher](functions-bindings-storage-queue?tabs=extensionv3#install-bundle) for non-.NET language stacks), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To use an identity, you define settings under a common prefix that maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

If you're setting `connection`

to "AzureWebJobsStorage", see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). For all other connections, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Queue Service URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__queueServiceUri` 1 |
The data plane URI of the queue service to which you're connecting, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.queue.core.windows.net |

1 `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri`

can be used as an alias. If both forms are provided, the `queueServiceUri`

form is used. The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables.

Other properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your queue at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Queue Storage extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
|

[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor),[Storage Queue Data Message Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-message-sender)## Exceptions and return codes

| Binding | Reference |

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article demonstrates the support that Azure Functions provides for containerized function apps that run in an Azure Container Apps environment. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

Important

A new hosting method for running Azure Functions directly in Azure Container Apps is now available. See [Native Azure Functions Support in Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039). This integration allows you to use the full features and capabilities of Azure Container Apps. You also benefit from the functions programming model and simplicity of autoscaling provided by Azure Functions.

We recommend this approach for most new workloads. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview).

This article demonstrates the support that Azure Functions provides for function apps that run in Linux containers.

Choose the hosting environment for your containerized function app at the top of this article.

If you want to jump right in, the following article shows you how to create your first function in a Linux container and deploy the image from a container registry to a supported Azure hosting service:


[Create your first containerized Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps]

To learn more about deployments to Azure Container Apps, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

Important

This article currently shows how to connect to the default storage account by using a connection string. For the best security, instead create a managed identity-based connection to Azure Storage using Microsoft Entra authentication. For more information, see [Connections](functions-reference#connections).

## Create containerized function apps

Functions makes it easy to deploy and run your function apps as Linux containers, which you create and maintain. Functions maintains a set of [language-specific base images](https://mcr.microsoft.com/catalog?search=functions) that you can use when creating containerized function apps.

Important

When you create your own containers, you're required to keep the base image of your container updated to the latest supported base image. Supported base images for Azure Functions are language-specific. See the [Azure Functions base image repos](https://mcr.microsoft.com/catalog?search=functions).

The Functions team is committed to publishing monthly updates for these base images. Regular updates include the latest minor version updates and security fixes for both the Functions runtime and languages. You should regularly update your container from the latest base image and redeploy the updated version of your container. For more information, see [Maintaining custom containers](container-concepts#maintaining-custom-containers).

For a complete example of how to create the local containerized function app from the command line and publish the image to a container registry, see [Create a function app in a local Linux container](functions-create-container-registry).

## Generate the Dockerfile

Functions tooling provides a Docker option that generates a Dockerfile with your functions code project. You can use this file with Docker to create your functions in a container that derives from the correct base image, which includes language and version.

The way you create a Dockerfile depends on how you create your project.

When you create a Functions project using

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local), include the`--docker`

option when you run thecommand, as in the following example:`func init`

`func init --docker`

You can also add a Dockerfile to an existing project by using the

`--docker-only`

option when you run thecommand in an existing project folder, as in the following example:`func init`

`func init --docker-only`


For a complete example, see [Create a function app in a local Linux container](functions-create-container-registry#create-and-test-the-local-functions-project).

## Create your function app in a container

With a Functions-generated Dockerfile in your code project, you can use Docker to create the containerized function app on your local computer. The following `docker build`

command creates an image of your containerized functions from the project in the local directory:

```
docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/<IMAGE_NAME>:v1.0.0 .
```


For an example of how to create the container, see [Build the container image and verify locally](functions-create-container-registry#build-the-container-image-and-verify-locally).

## Update an image in the registry

When you make changes to your functions code project or need to update to the latest base image, rebuild the container locally. Republish the updated image to your chosen container registry. The following command rebuilds the image from the root folder with an updated version number and pushes it to your registry:

```
az acr build --registry <REGISTRY_NAME> --image <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.1 .
```


Replace `<REGISTRY_NAME>`

with your Container Registry instance and `<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with the sign-in server name.

Update an existing deployment to use the new image. You can update the function app to use the new image either by using the Azure CLI or in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

```
az functionapp config container set --image <IMAGE_NAME> --registry-password <SECURE_PASSWORD>--registry-username <USER_NAME> --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
```


In this example, `<IMAGE_NAME>`

is the full name of the new image with version. Private registries require you to supply a username and password. Store these credentials securely.

You should also consider [enabling continuous deployment](#enable-continuous-deployment-to-azure).

## Create a containerized function app using the Azure portal

When you create a function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can choose to deploy the function app from an image in a container registry. To learn how to create a containerized function app in a container registry, see [Create your function app in a container](#create-your-function-app-in-a-container).

The following steps create and deploy an existing containerized function app from a container registry.

From the Azure portal menu or the

**Home**page, select**Create a resource**.In the

**New**page, select**Compute**>**Function App**.Under

**Select a hosting option**, choose**Functions Premium**>**Select**.This action creates a function app hosted by Azure Functions in the

**Go to resource**. In the function app page, select**Deployment Center**.In the

**Deployment Center**, you can connect your container registry as the source of the image. You can also enable GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines for more robust continuous deployment of updates to your container in the registry.

## Create a containerized function app using the Azure portal

When you create a Container Apps-hosted function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can choose to deploy your function app from an image in a container registry. To learn how to create a containerized function app in a container registry, see [Create your function app in a container](#create-your-function-app-in-a-container).

The following steps create and deploy an existing containerized function app from a container registry.

From the Azure portal menu or the

**Home**page, select**Create a resource**.In the

**New**page, select**Compute**>**Function App**.Under

**Select a hosting option**, choose**Container Apps environment**>**Select**.On the

**Basics**page, use the function app settings as specified in the following table:Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription in which you create your function app. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)*myResourceGroup*Name for the new resource group in which you create your function app. You should create a resource group because there are [known limitations when creating new function apps in an existing resource group](functions-scale#limitations-for-creating-new-function-apps-in-an-existing-resource-group).**Function App name**Unique name *Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z`

To minimize costs, the new default environment is created in the**Consumption + Dedicated**with the default workload profile and without zone redundancy. For more information, see[Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).You can also choose to use an existing Container Apps environment. To create a custom environment, instead select

**Create new**. In the**Create Container Apps Environment**page, you can add nondefault workload profiles or enable zone redundancy. To learn about environments, see[Azure Container Apps environments](../container-apps/environment).Select the

**Deployment**tab and unselect**Use quickstart image**. Otherwise, the function app is deployed from the base image for your function app language.Choose your

**Image type**, public or private. Choose**Private**if you're using Azure Container Registry or some other private registry. Supply the**Image**name, including the registry prefix. If you're using a private registry, provide the image registry authentication credentials. The**Public**setting only supports images stored publicly in Docker Hub.Under

**Container resource allocation**, select your desired number of CPU cores and available memory. If your environment has other workload profiles added, you can select a nondefault**Workload profile**. Choices  affect the cost of hosting your app. See the[Container Apps pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)to estimate your potential costs.Select

**Review + create**to review the app configuration selections.On the

**Review + create**page, review your settings, and then select**Create**to provision the function app and deploy your container image from the registry.

## Work with images in Azure Functions

When your function app container is deployed from a registry, Functions maintains information about the source image.

Use the following commands to get data about the image or change the deployment image used:

: returns information about the image used for deployment.`az functionapp config container show`

: change registry settings or update the image used for deployment, as shown in the previous example.`az functionapp config container set`


## Use Container Apps workload profiles

Workload profiles are feature of Container Apps that let you better control your deployment resources. Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps also supports workload profiles. For more information, see [Workload profiles in Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/workload-profiles-overview).

You can also set the amount of CPU and memory resources allocated to your app.

You can create and manage both workload profiles and resource allocations using the Azure CLI or in the Azure portal.

You enable workload profiles when you create your container app environment. For an example, see [Create a container app in a profile](../container-apps/workload-profiles-manage-cli#create-a-container-app-in-a-profile).

You can add, edit, and delete profiles in your environment. For an example, see [Add profiles](../container-apps/workload-profiles-manage-cli#add-profiles).

When you create a containerized function app in an environment that has workload profiles enabled, you should also specify the profile in which to run. Specify the profile by using the `--workload-profile-name`

parameter of the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command, like in this example:

```
az functionapp create --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --environment MyContainerappEnvironment --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --functions-version 4 --runtime <LANGUAGE_STACK> --image <IMAGE_URI> --workload-profile-name <PROFILE_NAME> --cpu <CPU_COUNT> --memory <MEMORY_SIZE>
```


In the [az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command, the `--environment`

parameter specifies the Container Apps environment and the `--image`

parameter specifies the image to use for the function app. In this example, replace `<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the name you used in the previous section for the storage account. Also, replace `<APP_NAME>`

with a name appropriate to you that is unique in the environment.

To set the resources allocated to your app, replace `<CPU_COUNT>`

with your desired number of virtual CPUs, with a minimum of 0.5 up to the maximum allowed by the profile. For `<MEMORY_SIZE>`

, choose a dedicated memory amount from 1 GB up to the maximum allowed by the profile.

You can use the [az functionapp container set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/container#az-functionapp-config-container-set) command to manage the allocated resources and the workload profile used by your app.

```
az functionapp container set --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --workload-profile-name <PROFILE_NAME> --cpu <CPU_COUNT> --memory <MEMORY_SIZE>
```


## Use application settings

Azure Functions lets you work with application settings for containerized function apps in the standard way. For more information, see [Use application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings).

Tip

By default, a containerized function app monitors port 80 for incoming requests. If your app must use a different port, use the [ WEBSITES_PORT application setting](../app-service/reference-app-settings#custom-containers) to change this port.

## Enable continuous deployment to Azure

When you host your containerized function app on Azure Container Apps, there are two ways to set up continuous deployment from a source code repository:

You aren't currently able to continuously deploy containers based on image changes in a container registry. You must instead use these source-code based continuous deployment pipelines.

## Enable continuous deployment to Azure

Important

Webhook-based deployment isn't currently supported when running your container in an [Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan). If you need to use the continuous deployment method described in this section, instead deploy your container in an [App Service plan](dedicated-plan). When running in an Elastic Premium plan, you need to manually restart your app whenever you make updates to your container in the repository.

You can also configure continuous deployment from a source code repository using either [Azure Pipelines](functions-how-to-azure-devops#deploy-a-container) or [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-on-container-apps/blob/main/samples/GitHubActions/Func_on_ACA_GitHubAction_deployment.yml).

You can enable Azure Functions to automatically update your deployment of an image whenever you update the image in the registry.

Use the following command to enable continuous deployment and to get the webhook URL:

`az functionapp deployment container config --enable-cd --query CI_CD_URL --output tsv --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`

The

[az functionapp deployment container config](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/deployment/container#az-functionapp-deployment-container-config)command enables continuous deployment and returns the deployment webhook URL. You can retrieve this URL at any time by using the[az functionapp deployment container show-cd-url](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/deployment/container#az-functionapp-deployment-container-show-cd-url)command.As before, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with your function app name.Copy the deployment webhook URL to the clipboard.

Open

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), sign in, and select**Repositories**on the navigation bar. Locate and select the image, select the**Webhooks**tab, specify a**Webhook name**, paste your URL in**Webhook URL**, and then select**Create**.With the webhook set, Azure Functions redeploys your image whenever you update it in Docker Hub.


## Enable SSH connections

SSH enables secure communication between a container and a client. With SSH enabled, you can connect to your container using App Service Advanced Tools (Kudu). For easy connection to your container using SSH, Azure Functions provides a base image that has SSH already enabled. You only need to edit your *Dockerfile*, then rebuild, and redeploy the image. You can then connect to the container through the Advanced Tools (Kudu).

In your

*Dockerfile*, append the string`-appservice`

to the base image in your`FROM`

instruction, as in the following example:`FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/node:4-node18-appservice`

This example uses the SSH-enabled version of the Node.js version 18 base image. Visit the

[Azure Functions base image repos](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/catalog?search=functions)to verify that you're using the latest version of the SSH-enabled base image.Rebuild the image by using the

`docker build`

command, replace the`<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker Hub account ID, as in the following example.`docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .`

Push the updated image to Docker Hub, which should take considerably less time than the first push. Only the updated segments of the image need to be uploaded now.

`docker push <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

Azure Functions automatically redeploys the image to your functions app. The process takes place in less than a minute.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), locate your function app. In the left menu, select**Development Tools**>**SSH**. Select**Go**. Connecting might take a few moments if Azure is still updating the container image.After a connection is established with your container, run the

`top`

command to view the currently running processes.

# Azure Database for MySQL trigger binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Database for MySQL trigger bindings monitor the user table for changes (inserts and updates) and invoke the function with updated row data.

Azure Database for MySQL trigger bindings use `az_func_updated_at`

and column data to monitor the user table for changes. As such, you need to alter the table structure to allow change tracking on the MySQL table before you use the trigger support. You can enable the change tracking on a table through the following query. For example, enable it on the `Products`

table:

```
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```


The table for leases contains all columns that correspond to the primary key from the user table and three more columns: `az_func_AttemptCount`

, `az_func_LeaseExpirationTime`

, and `az_func_SyncCompletedTime`

. If any of the primary key columns have the same name, the result is an error message that lists conflicts. In this case, the listed primary key columns must be renamed for the trigger to work.

## Functionality overview

When the trigger function starts, it initiates two separate loops: the change polling loop and the lease renewal loop. These loops run continuously until the function is stopped.

The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binding uses the polling loop to check for changes. The polling loop triggers the user function when it detects changes. At a high level, the loop looks like this example:

```
while (true) {
1. Get list of changes on table - up to a maximum number controlled by the MySql_Trigger_MaxBatchSize setting
2. Trigger function with list of changes
3. Wait for delay controlled by MySql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs setting
}
```


Changes are processed in the order that they're made. The oldest changes are processed first. Consider these points about change processing:

- If changes occur in multiple rows at once, the exact order in which they're sent to the function is based on the ascending order of the
`az_func_updated_at`

column and primary key columns. - Changes are batched for a row. If multiple changes occur in a row between each iteration of the loop, only the latest change entry that exists for that row is considered.

Note

Currently, managed identities aren't supported for connections between Azure Functions and Azure Database for MySQL.

## Example usage

More samples for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples).

The example refers to a `Product`

class and a corresponding database table:

```
namespace AzureMySqlSamples.Common
{
public class Product
{
public int? ProductId { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public int Cost { get; set; }
public override bool Equals(object obj)
{
if (obj is Product)
{
var that = obj as Product;
return this.ProductId == that.ProductId && this.Name == that.Name && this.Cost == that.Cost;
}
return false;
}
}
```


```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;
CREATE TABLE Products (
ProductId int PRIMARY KEY,
Name varchar(100) NULL,
Cost int NULL
);
```


You enable change tracking on the database by adding one column to the table:

```
ALTER TABLE <table name>
ADD COLUMN az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```


The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binds to `IReadOnlyList<MySqlChange<T>>`

, which lists `MySqlChange`

objects. Each object has two properties:

`Item`

: The item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema, as seen in the`ToDoItem`

class.`Operation`

: A value from the`MySqlChangeOperation`

enumeration. The possible value is`Update`

for both inserts and updates.

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that's invoked when changes occur in the `Product`

table:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.MySql;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using AzureMySqlSamples.Common;
namespace AzureMySqlSamples.TriggerBindingSamples
{
private static readonly Action<ILogger, string, Exception> _loggerMessage = LoggerMessage.Define<string>(LogLevel.Information, eventId: new EventId(0, "INFO"), formatString: "{Message}");
[Function(nameof(ProductsTrigger))]
public static void Run(
[MySqlTrigger("Products", "MySqlConnectionString")]
IReadOnlyList<MySqlChange<Product>> changes, FunctionContext context)
{
ILogger logger = context.GetLogger("ProductsTrigger");
// The output is used to inspect the trigger binding parameter in test methods.
foreach (MySqlChange<Product> change in changes)
{
Product product = change.Item;
_loggerMessage(logger, $"Change operation: {change.Operation}", null);
_loggerMessage(logger, $"Product Id: {product.ProductId}, Name: {product.Name}, Cost: {product.Cost}", null);
}
}
}
```


## Example usage

More samples for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-java).

The example refers to a `Product`

class, a `MySqlChangeProduct`

class, a `MySqlChangeOperation`

enumeration, and a corresponding database table.

In a separate file named Product.java:

```
package com.function.Common;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
public class Product {
@JsonProperty("ProductId")
private int ProductId;
@JsonProperty("Name")
private String Name;
@JsonProperty("Cost")
private int Cost;
public Product() {
}
public Product(int productId, String name, int cost) {
ProductId = productId;
Name = name;
Cost = cost;
}
}
```


In a separate file named MySqlChangeProduct.java:

```
package com.function.Common;
public class MySqlChangeProduct {
private MySqlChangeOperation Operation;
private Product Item;
public MySqlChangeProduct() {
}
public MySqlChangeProduct(MySqlChangeOperation operation, Product item) {
this.Operation = operation;
this.Item = item;
}
}
```


In a separate file named MySqlChangeOperation.java:

```
package com.function.Common;
import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName;
public enum MySqlChangeOperation {
@SerializedName("0")
Update
}
```


```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Products;
CREATE TABLE Products (
ProductId int PRIMARY KEY,
Name varchar(100) NULL,
Cost int NULL
);
```


You enable change tracking on the database by adding the following column to the table:

```
ALTER TABLE <table name>
ADD COLUMN az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```


The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binds to `MySqlChangeProduct[]`

, which is an array of `MySqlChangeProduct`

objects. Each object has two properties:

`item`

: The item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema, as seen in the`Product`

class.`operation`

: A value from the`MySqlChangeOperation`

enumeration. The possible value is`Update`

for both inserts and updates.

The following example shows a Java function that's invoked when changes occur in the `Product`

table:

```

}
```


## Example usage

More samples for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-powershell).

The example refers to a `Product`

database table:

CREATE TABLE Products (
ProductId int PRIMARY KEY,
Name varchar(100) NULL,
Cost int NULL
);
```


You enable change tracking on the database by adding one column to the table:

```
ALTER TABLE <table name>
ADD COLUMN az_func_updated_at TIMESTAMP
DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```


The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binds to `Product`

, which lists objects. Each object has two properties:

`item`

: The item that was changed. The structure of the item follows the table schema.`operation`

: The possible value is`Update`

for both inserts and updates.

The following example shows a PowerShell function that's invoked when changes occur in the `Product`

table.

The following example is binding data in the function.json file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "changes",
"type": "mysqlTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"tableName": "Products",
"connectionStringSetting": "MySqlConnectionString"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The [Configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following example is sample PowerShell code for the function in the run.ps1 file:

```
using namespace System.Net
param($changes)
# The output is used to inspect the trigger binding parameter in test methods.
# Use -Compress to remove new lines and spaces for testing purposes.
$changesJson = $changes | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
Write-Host "MySql Changes: $changesJson"
```

Note

You must use Azure Functions version 1.22.0b4 for Python.

The Azure Database for MySQL trigger binds to a variable named `Product`

, which lists objects. Each object has two properties:

`item`

: The item that was changed. The structure of the item follows the table schema.`operation`

: The possible value is`Update`

for both inserts and updates.

The following example shows a Python function that's invoked when changes occur in the `Product`

table.

The following example is sample Python code for the function_app.py file:

```
import json
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
# The function is triggered when a change (insert, update)
# is made to the Products table.
@app.function_name(name="ProductsTrigger")
@app.mysql_trigger(arg_name="products",
table_name="Products",
connection_string_setting="MySqlConnectionString")
def products_trigger(products: str) -> None:
logging.info("MySQL Changes: %s", json.loads(products))
```

.## Optional configuration

You can configure the following optional settings for the Azure Database for MySQL trigger for local development or for cloud deployments.

### host.json

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding in version 2.x and later. Settings in the host.json file apply to all functions in a function app instance. For more information about function app configuration settings, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
`MaxBatchSize` |
`100` |
The maximum number of changes processed with each iteration of the trigger loop before they're sent to the triggered function. |
`PollingIntervalMs` |
`1000` |
The delay in milliseconds between processing each batch of changes. (1,000 ms is 1 second.) |
`MaxChangesPerWorker` |
`1000` |
The upper limit on the number of pending changes in the user table that are allowed per application worker. If the count of changes exceeds this limit, it might result in a scale-out. The setting applies only for Azure function apps with
|

#### Example host.json file

Here's an example host.json file with the optional settings:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"MySql": {
"MaxBatchSize": 300,
"PollingIntervalMs": 1000,
"MaxChangesPerWorker": 100
}
},
"logging": {
"applicationInsights": {
"samplingSettings": {
"isEnabled": true,
"excludedTypes": "Request"
}
},
"logLevel": {
"default": "Trace"
}
}
}
```


### local.setting.json

The local.settings.json file stores app settings and settings that local development tools use. Settings in the local.settings.json file are used only when you're running your project locally. When you publish your project to Azure, be sure to also add any required settings to the app settings for the function app.

Important

Because the local.settings.json file might contain secrets, such as connection strings, you should never store it in a remote repository. Tools that support Azure Functions provide ways to synchronize settings in the local.settings.json file with the [app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) in the function app to which your project is deployed.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
`MySql_Trigger_BatchSize` |
`100` |
The maximum number of changes processed with each iteration of the trigger loop before they're sent to the triggered function. |
`MySql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs` |
`1000` |
The delay in milliseconds between processing each batch of changes. (1,000 ms is 1 second.) |
`MySql_Trigger_MaxChangesPerWorker` |
`1000` |
The upper limit on the number of pending changes in the user table that are allowed per application worker. If the count of changes exceeds this limit, it might result in a scale-out. The setting applies only for Azure function apps with
|

#### Example local.settings.json file

Here's an example local.settings.json file with the optional settings:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
"MySqlConnectionString": "",
"MySql_Trigger_MaxBatchSize": 300,
"MySql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs": 1000,
"MySql_Trigger_MaxChangesPerWorker": 100
}
}
```


## Set up change tracking (required)

Setting up change tracking for use with the Azure Database for MySQL trigger requires you to add a column in a table by using a function. You can complete these steps from any MySQL tool that supports running queries, including [Visual Studio Code](/en-us/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/mssql-extensions) or [Azure Data Studio](/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).

Azure Database for MySQL trigger bindings use `az_func_updated_at`

and column data to monitor the user table for changes. As such, you need to alter the table structure to allow change tracking on the MySQL table before you use the trigger support. You can enable the change tracking on a table through the following query. For example, enable it on the `Products`

table:

```
ALTER TABLE Products;
ADD az_func_updated_at
TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```


The table for leases contains all columns that correspond to the primary key from the user table and two more columns: `az_func_AttemptCount`

and `az_func_LeaseExpirationTime`

. If any of the primary key columns have the same name, the result is an error message that lists conflicts. In this case, the listed primary key columns must be renamed for the trigger to work.

## Enable runtime-driven scaling

Optionally, your functions can scale automatically based on the number of changes that are pending to be processed in the user table. To allow your functions to scale properly on the Premium plan when you're using Azure Database for MySQL triggers, you need to enable runtime scale monitoring.

In the Azure portal, in your function app, select

**Configuration**.On the

**Function runtime settings**tab, for**Runtime Scale Monitoring**, select**On**.

## Retry support

### Startup retries

If an exception occurs during startup, the host runtime automatically attempts to restart the trigger listener with an exponential backoff strategy. These retries continue until either the listener is successfully started or the startup is canceled.

### Function exception retries

If an exception occurs in the user function during change processing, the batch of rows currently being processed is retried again in 60 seconds. Other changes are processed as normal during this time, but the rows in the batch that caused the exception are ignored until the time-out period elapses.

If the function execution fails five consecutive times for a particular row, that row is ignored for all future changes. Because the rows in a batch aren't deterministic, rows in a failed batch might end up in different batches in subsequent invocations. This behavior means that not all rows in the failed batch are necessarily ignored. If other rows in the batch caused the exception, the "good" rows might end up in a different batch that doesn't fail in future invocations.

# Azure Tables input bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the Azure Tables input binding to read a table in [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) or [Azure Table Storage](../storage/tables/table-storage-overview).

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-storage-table).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

## Example

The usage of the binding depends on the extension package version and the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

An [isolated worker process class library](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see examples for the mode and version.

The following `MyTableData`

class represents a row of data in the table:

```
public class MyTableData : Azure.Data.Tables.ITableEntity
{
public string Text { get; set; }
public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
public string RowKey { get; set; }
public DateTimeOffset? Timestamp { get; set; }
public ETag ETag { get; set; }
}
```


The following function, which is started by a Queue Storage trigger, reads a row key from the queue, which is used to get the row from the input table. The expression `{queueTrigger}`

binds the row key to the message metadata, which is the message string.

```
[Function("TableFunction")]
[TableOutput("OutputTable", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public static MyTableData Run(
[QueueTrigger("table-items")] string input,
[TableInput("MyTable", "<PartitionKey>", "{queueTrigger}")] MyTableData tableInput,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger("TableFunction");
logger.LogInformation($"PK={tableInput.PartitionKey}, RK={tableInput.RowKey}, Text={tableInput.Text}");
return new MyTableData()
{
PartitionKey = "queue",
RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
Text = $"Output record with rowkey {input} created at {DateTime.Now}"
};
}
```


The following Queue-triggered function returns the first 5 entities as an `IEnumerable<T>`

, with the partition key value set as the queue message.

```
[Function("TestFunction")]
public static void Run([QueueTrigger("myqueue", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")] string partition,
[TableInput("inTable", "{queueTrigger}", Take = 5, Filter = "Text eq 'test'",
Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")] IEnumerable<MyTableData> tableInputs,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger("TestFunction");
logger.LogInformation(partition);
foreach (MyTableData tableInput in tableInputs)
{
logger.LogInformation($"PK={tableInput.PartitionKey}, RK={tableInput.RowKey}, Text={tableInput.Text}");
}
}
```


The `Filter`

and `Take`

properties are used to limit the number of entities returned.

The following example shows an HTTP triggered function which returns a list of person objects who are in a specified partition in Table storage. In the example, the partition key is extracted from the http route, and the tableName and connection are from the function settings.

```
public class Person {
private String PartitionKey;
private String RowKey;
private String Name;
public String getPartitionKey() { return this.PartitionKey; }
public void setPartitionKey(String key) { this.PartitionKey = key; }
public String getRowKey() { return this.RowKey; }
public void setRowKey(String key) { this.RowKey = key; }
public String getName() { return this.Name; }
public void setName(String name) { this.Name = name; }
}
@FunctionName("getPersonsByPartitionKey")
public Person[] get(
@HttpTrigger(name = "getPersons", methods = {HttpMethod.GET}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION, route="persons/{partitionKey}") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@BindingName("partitionKey") String partitionKey,
@TableInput(name="persons", partitionKey="{partitionKey}", tableName="%MyTableName%", connection="MyConnectionString") Person[] persons,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Got query for person related to persons with partition key: " + partitionKey);
return persons;
}
```


The TableInput annotation can also extract the bindings from the json body of the request, like the following example shows.

```
@FunctionName("GetPersonsByKeysFromRequest")
public HttpResponseMessage get(
@HttpTrigger(name = "getPerson", methods = {HttpMethod.GET}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION, route="query") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@TableInput(name="persons", partitionKey="{partitionKey}", rowKey = "{rowKey}", tableName="%MyTableName%", connection="MyConnectionString") Person person,
final ExecutionContext context) {
if (person == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
.body("Person not found.")
.build();
}
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(person)
.build();
}
```


The following example uses a filter to query for persons with a specific name in an Azure Table, and limits the number of possible matches to 10 results.

```
@FunctionName("getPersonsByName")
public Person[] get(
@HttpTrigger(name = "getPersons", methods = {HttpMethod.GET}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION, route="filter/{name}") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@BindingName("name") String name,
@TableInput(name="persons", filter="Name eq '{name}'", take = "10", tableName="%MyTableName%", connection="MyConnectionString") Person[] persons,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Got query for person related to persons with name: " + name);
return persons;
}
```


The following example shows a table input binding that uses a queue trigger to read a single table row. The binding specifies a `partitionKey`

and a `rowKey`

. The `rowKey`

value "{queueTrigger}" indicates that the row key comes from the queue message string.

```
import { app, input, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';

The following function uses a queue trigger to read a single table row as input to a function.

In this example, the binding configuration specifies an explicit value for the table's `partitionKey`

and uses an expression to pass to the `rowKey`

. The `rowKey`

expression, `{queueTrigger}`

, indicates that the row key comes from the queue message string.

Binding configuration in *function.json*:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"queueName": "myqueue-items",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
"name": "MyQueueItem",
"type": "queueTrigger",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"name": "PersonEntity",
"type": "table",
"tableName": "Person",
"partitionKey": "Test",
"rowKey": "{queueTrigger}",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
"direction": "in"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


PowerShell code in *run.ps1*:

```
param($MyQueueItem, $PersonEntity, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "PowerShell queue trigger function processed work item: $MyQueueItem"
Write-Host "Person entity name: $($PersonEntity.Name)"
```


The following function uses an HTTP trigger to read a single table row as input to a function.

In this example, binding configuration specifies an explicit value for the table's `partitionKey`

and uses an expression to pass to the `rowKey`

. The `rowKey`

expression, `{id}`

indicates that the row key comes from the `{id}`

part of the route in the request.

```
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="messages/{id}")
@app.table_input(arg_name="messageJSON",
connection="AzureWebJobsStorage",
table_name="messages",
row_key='{id}',
partition_key="message")
def table_in_binding(req: func.HttpRequest, messageJSON):
message = json.loads(messageJSON)
return func.HttpResponse(f"Table row: {messageJSON}")
```


With this simple binding, you can't programmatically handle a case in which no row that has a row key ID is found. For more fine-grained data selection, use the [storage SDK](/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/examples/azure-sdk-example-storage-use?tabs=cmd).

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#table-input).

In [C# class libraries](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), the `TableInputAttribute`

supports the following properties:

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
TableName |
The name of the table. |
PartitionKey |
Optional. The partition key of the table entity to read. |
RowKey |
Optional. The row key of the table entity to read. |
Take |

`RowKey`

.**Filter**[. Can't be used with](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1)`IEnumerable<T>`

`RowKey`

.**Connection**[Connections](#connections).## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@TableInput`

annotation on parameters whose value would come from Table storage. This annotation can be used with native Java types, POJOs, or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

. This annotation supports the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
|
The name of the variable that represents the table or entity in function code. |
|
The name of the table. |
|
Optional. The partition key of the table entity to read. |
|
Optional. The row key of the table entity to read. |
|
Optional. The maximum number of entities to read. |
|
Optional. An OData filter expression for table input. |
|
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the table service. See

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration that specifies how the app should connect to your table service. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections)

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string for tables in Azure Table storage, follow the steps shown at [Manage storage account access keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage). To obtain a connection string for tables in Azure Cosmos DB for Table, follow the steps shown at the [Azure Cosmos DB for Table FAQ](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/table-api-faq#what-is-the-connection-string-that-i-need-to-use-to-connect-to-the-api-for-table-).

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name here. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyStorage", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyStorage". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Storage connection string in the app setting that is named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using [the Tables API extension](functions-bindings-storage-table#table-api-extension), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). This only applies when accessing tables in Azure Storage. To use an identity, you define settings under a common prefix that maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

If you're setting `connection`

to "AzureWebJobsStorage", see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). For all other connections, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Table Service URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tableServiceUri` 1 |
The data plane URI of the Azure Storage table service to which you're connecting, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net |

1 `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri`

can be used as an alias. If both forms are provided, the `tableServiceUri`

form is used. The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables.

Other properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables in Azure Storage. The URI can only designate the table service. As an alternative, you can provide a URI specifically for each service under the same prefix, allowing a single connection to be used.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You'll need to create a role assignment that provides access to your Azure Storage table service at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Azure Tables extension against Azure Storage in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles (Azure Storage1) |
|---|---|
| Input binding |
|

[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)1 If your app is instead connecting to tables in Azure Cosmos DB for Table, using an identity isn't supported and the connection must use a connection string.

## Usage

The usage of the binding depends on the extension package version, and the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see usage details for the mode and version.

When working with a single table entity, the Azure Tables input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| A JSON serializable type that implements
|

[ITableEntity](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.itableentity)or have a string`RowKey`

property and a string `PartitionKey`

property.[TableEntity](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.tableentity)1When working with multiple entities from a query, the Azure Tables input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`IEnumerable<T>` where `T` implements
|
An enumeration of entities returned by the query. Each entry represents one entity. The type `T` must implement
`RowKey` property and a string `PartitionKey` property. |
1 |

1 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables 1.2.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables/1.2.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

The [TableInput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.tableinput) attribute gives you access to the table row that triggered the function.

Data is passed to the input parameter as specified by the `name`

key in the *function.json* file. Specifying The `partitionKey`

and `rowKey`

allows you to filter to specific records.

Table data is passed to the function as a JSON string. De-serialize the message by calling `json.loads`

as shown in the input [example](#example).

For specific usage details, see [Example](#example).

## durableTask

Configuration settings for [Durable Functions](durable/durable-functions-overview).

Note

All major versions of Durable Functions are supported on all versions of the Azure Functions runtime. However, the schema of the *host.json* configuration differs slightly depending on the version of the Azure Functions runtime and the version of the Durable Functions extension that you use.

The following code provides two examples of `durableTask`

settings in *host.json*: one for Durable Functions 2.x and one for Durable Functions 1.x. You can use both examples with Azure Functions 2.0 and 3.0. With Azure Functions 1.0, the available settings are the same, but the `durableTask`

section of *host.json* is located in the root of the *host.json* configuration instead of being a field under `extensions`

.

For more information, see [Performance and scale](durable/durable-functions-perf-and-scale).

## eventHub

Configuration settings for [Event Hub triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-event-hubs?tabs=functionsv1#hostjson-settings).

## functions

A list of functions that the job host runs. An empty array means run all functions. Intended for use only when [running locally](functions-run-local). In function apps in Azure, you should instead follow the steps in [How to disable functions in Azure Functions](disable-function) to disable specific functions rather than using this setting.

```
{
"functions": [ "QueueProcessor", "GitHubWebHook" ]
}
```


## functionTimeout

Indicates the timeout duration for all functions. In a serverless Consumption plan, the valid range is from 1 second to 10 minutes, and the default value is 5 minutes. In an App Service plan, there is no overall limit and the default is *null*, which indicates no timeout.

```
{
"functionTimeout": "00:05:00"
}
```


## healthMonitor

Configuration settings for [Host health monitor](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki/Host-Health-Monitor).

```
{
"healthMonitor": {
"enabled": true,
"healthCheckInterval": "00:00:10",
"healthCheckWindow": "00:02:00",
"healthCheckThreshold": 6,
"counterThreshold": 0.80
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| enabled | true | Specifies whether the feature is enabled. |
| healthCheckInterval | 10 seconds | The time interval between the periodic background health checks. |
| healthCheckWindow | 2 minutes | A sliding time window used with the `healthCheckThreshold` setting. |
| healthCheckThreshold | 6 | Maximum number of times the health check can fail before a host recycle is initiated. |
| counterThreshold | 0.80 | The threshold at which a performance counter will be considered unhealthy. |

## http

Configuration settings for [http triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-http-webhook).

```
{
"http": {
"routePrefix": "api",
"maxOutstandingRequests": 200,
"maxConcurrentRequests": 100,
"dynamicThrottlesEnabled": true
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| dynamicThrottlesEnabled | false | When enabled, this setting causes the request processing pipeline to periodically check system performance counters like connections/threads/processes/memory/cpu/etc. and if any of those counters are over a built-in high threshold (80%), requests are rejected with a 429 "Too Busy" response until the counter(s) return to normal levels. |
| maxConcurrentRequests | unbounded (`-1` ) |
The maximum number of HTTP functions that will be executed in parallel. This allows you to control concurrency, which can help manage resource utilization. For example, you might have an HTTP function that uses a lot of system resources (memory/cpu/sockets) such that it causes issues when concurrency is too high. Or you might have a function that makes outbound requests to a third party service, and those calls need to be rate limited. In these cases, applying a throttle here can help. |
| maxOutstandingRequests | unbounded (`-1` ) |
The maximum number of outstanding requests that are held at any given time. This limit includes requests that are queued but have not started executing, and any in progress executions. Any incoming requests over this limit are rejected with a 429 "Too Busy" response. That allows callers to employ time-based retry strategies, and also helps you to control maximum request latencies. This only controls queuing that occurs within the script host execution path. Other queues such as the ASP.NET request queue will still be in effect and unaffected by this setting. |
| routePrefix | api | The route prefix that applies to all routes. Use an empty string to remove the default prefix. |

## id

The unique ID for a job host. Can be a lower case GUID with dashes removed. Required when running locally. When running in Azure, we recommend that you not set an ID value. An ID is generated automatically in Azure when `id`

is omitted.

If you share a Storage account across multiple function apps, make sure that each function app has a different `id`

. You can omit the `id`

property or manually set each function app's `id`

to a different value. The timer trigger uses a storage lock to ensure that there will be only one timer instance when a function app scales out to multiple instances. If two function apps share the same `id`

and each uses a timer trigger, only one timer runs.

```
{
"id": "9f4ea53c5136457d883d685e57164f08"
}
```


## logger

Controls filtering for logs written by an [ILogger](functions-dotnet-class-library#ilogger) object or by [context.log](functions-reference-node#contextlog-method).

```
{
"logger": {
"categoryFilter": {
"defaultLevel": "Information",
"categoryLevels": {
"Host": "Error",
"Function": "Error",
"Host.Aggregator": "Information"
}
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| categoryFilter | n/a | Specifies filtering by category |
| defaultLevel | Information | For any categories not specified in the `categoryLevels` array, send logs at this level and above to Application Insights. |
| categoryLevels | n/a | An array of categories that specifies the minimum log level to send to Application Insights for each category. The category specified here controls all categories that begin with the same value, and longer values take precedence. In the preceding sample host.json file, all categories that begin with "Host.Aggregator" log at `Information` level. All other categories that begin with "Host", such as "Host.Executor", log at `Error` level. |

## queues

Configuration settings for [Storage queue triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-storage-queue).

```
{
"queues": {
"maxPollingInterval": 2000,
"visibilityTimeout" : "00:00:30",
"batchSize": 16,
"maxDequeueCount": 5,
"newBatchThreshold": 8
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| maxPollingInterval | 60000 | The maximum interval in milliseconds between queue polls. |
| visibilityTimeout | 0 | The time interval between retries when processing of a message fails. |
| batchSize | 16 | The number of queue messages that the Functions runtime retrieves simultaneously and processes in parallel. When the number being processed gets down to the `newBatchThreshold` , the runtime gets another batch and starts processing those messages. So the maximum number of concurrent messages being processed per function is `batchSize` plus `newBatchThreshold` . This limit applies separately to each queue-triggered function. If you want to avoid parallel execution for messages received on one queue, you can set `batchSize` to 1. However, this setting eliminates concurrency only so long as your function app runs on a single virtual machine (VM). If the function app scales out to multiple VMs, each VM could run one instance of each queue-triggered function.The maximum `batchSize` is 32. |
| maxDequeueCount | 5 | The number of times to try processing a message before moving it to the poison queue. |
| newBatchThreshold | batchSize/2 | Whenever the number of messages being processed concurrently gets down to this number, the runtime retrieves another batch. |

## SendGrid

Configuration setting for the [SendGrind output binding](functions-bindings-sendgrid)

```
{
"sendGrid": {
"from": "Contoso Group <admin@contoso.com>"
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| from | n/a | The sender's email address across all functions. |

## serviceBus

Configuration setting for [Service Bus triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-service-bus).

```
{
"serviceBus": {
"maxConcurrentCalls": 16,
"prefetchCount": 100,
"autoRenewTimeout": "00:05:00",
"autoComplete": true
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| maxConcurrentCalls | 16 | The maximum number of concurrent calls to the callback that the message pump should initiate. By default, the Functions runtime processes multiple messages concurrently. To direct the runtime to process only a single queue or topic message at a time, set `maxConcurrentCalls` to 1. |
| prefetchCount | n/a | The default PrefetchCount that will be used by the underlying ServiceBusReceiver. |
| autoRenewTimeout | 00:05:00 | The maximum duration within which the message lock will be renewed automatically. |
| autoComplete | true | When true, the trigger completes the message processing automatically on successful execution of the operation. When false, it is the responsibility of the function to complete the message before returning. |

## singleton

Configuration settings for Singleton lock behavior. For more information, see [GitHub issue about singleton support](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/issues/912).

```
{
"singleton": {
"lockPeriod": "00:00:15",
"listenerLockPeriod": "00:01:00",
"listenerLockRecoveryPollingInterval": "00:01:00",
"lockAcquisitionTimeout": "00:01:00",
"lockAcquisitionPollingInterval": "00:00:03"
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| lockPeriod | 00:00:15 | The period that function level locks are taken for. The locks auto-renew. |
| listenerLockPeriod | 00:01:00 | The period that listener locks are taken for. |
| listenerLockRecoveryPollingInterval | 00:01:00 | The time interval used for listener lock recovery if a listener lock couldn't be acquired on startup. |
| lockAcquisitionTimeout | 00:01:00 | The maximum amount of time the runtime tries to acquire a lock. |
| lockAcquisitionPollingInterval | n/a | The interval between lock acquisition attempts. |

## tracing

*Version 1.x*

Configuration settings for logs that you create by using a `TraceWriter`

object. To learn more, see [C# Logging].

```
{
"tracing": {
"consoleLevel": "verbose",
"fileLoggingMode": "debugOnly"
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| consoleLevel | info | The tracing level for console logging. Options are: `off` , `error` , `warning` , `info` , and `verbose` . |
| fileLoggingMode | debugOnly | The tracing level for file logging. Options are `never` , `always` , `debugOnly` . |

## watchDirectories

A set of [shared code directories](functions-reference-csharp#watched-directories) that should be monitored for changes. Ensures that when code in these directories is changed, the changes are picked up by your functions.

```
{
"watchDirectories": [ "Shared" ]
}
```
