# Develop legacy C# class library functions using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This article is an introduction to developing Azure Functions by using C# in .NET class libraries. These class libraries are used to run *in-process with the Functions runtime*. Your .NET functions can alternatively run _isolated from the Functions *runtime*, which offers several advantages. To learn more, see [the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). For a comprehensive comparison between these two models, see [Differences between the in-process model and the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

Important

This article supports .NET class library functions that run in-process with the runtime. Your C# functions can also run out-of-process and isolated from the Functions runtime. The isolated worker process model is the only way to run non-LTS versions of .NET and .NET Framework apps in current versions of the Functions runtime. To learn more, see [.NET isolated worker process functions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).
For a comprehensive comparison between isolated worker process and in-process .NET Functions, see [Differences between in-process and isolate worker process .NET Azure Functions](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

As a C# developer, you might also be interested in one of the following articles:

| Getting started | Concepts | Guided learning/samples |
|---|---|---|

Azure Functions supports C# and C# script programming languages. If you're looking for guidance on [using C# in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal), see [C# script (.csx) developer reference](functions-reference-csharp).

## Supported versions

Versions of the Functions runtime support specific versions of .NET. To learn more about Functions versions, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions). Version support also depends on whether your functions run in-process or isolated worker process.

Note

To learn how to change the Functions runtime version used by your function app, see [view and update the current runtime version](set-runtime-version#view-the-current-runtime-version).

The following table shows the highest level of .NET or .NET Framework that can be used with a specific version of Functions.

| Functions runtime version |
|
|---|

[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library)

4

15.NET 9.0

.NET 8.0

.NET Framework 4.8

231 .NET 6 was previously supported on both models but reached the [end of official support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) on November 12, 2024. .NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the [end of official support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) on May 14, 2024.

2 The build process also requires the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

3 Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

4 Support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

5 You can't run .NET 10 apps on Linux in the Consumption plan. To run on Linux, you should instead use the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). For step-by-step migration instructions, see [Migrate Consumption plan apps to the Flex Consumption plan](migration/migrate-plan-consumption-to-flex?pivots=platform-linux).

For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

### Updating to target .NET 8

Apps using the in-process model can target .NET 8 by following the steps outlined in this section. However, if you choose to exercise this option, you should still begin planning your [migration to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) in advance of [support ending for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model).

Many apps can change the configuration of the function app in Azure without updates to code or redeployment. To run .NET 8 with the in-process model, three configurations are required:

- The
[application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings)`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

must be set with the value "dotnet". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

must be set with the value "~4". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

must be set with the value "1". - You must
[update the stack configuration](update-language-versions#update-the-stack-configuration)to reference .NET 8.

Support for .NET 8 still uses version 4.x of the Functions runtime, and no change to the configured runtime version is required.

To update your local project, first make sure you're using the latest versions of local tools. Then ensure that the project references [version 4.4.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.4.0). You can then change your `TargetFramework`

to "net8.0". You must also update `local.settings.json`

to include both `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

set to "dotnet" and `FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

set to "1".

The following example is a minimal `project`

file with these changes:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.4.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<None Update="host.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</None>
<None Update="local.settings.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
<CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


The following example is a minimal `local.settings.json`

file with these changes:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED": "1",
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
}
}
```


If your app uses [ Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions), ensure it targets version 1.5.3 or later. Due to a behavior change in .NET 8, apps with older versions of the package throw an ambiguous constructor exception.

You might need to make other changes to your app based on the version support of its other dependencies.

Version 4.x of the Functions runtime provides equivalent functionality for .NET 6 and .NET 8. The in-process model doesn't include other features or updates that integrate with new .NET 8 capabilities. For example, the runtime doesn't support keyed services. To take full advantage of the latest .NET 8 capabilities and enhancements, you must [migrate to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

## Functions class library project

In Visual Studio, the **Azure Functions** project template creates a C# class library project that contains the following files:

[host.json](functions-host-json)- stores configuration settings that affect all functions in the project when running locally or in Azure.[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)- stores app settings and connection strings that are used when running locally. This file contains secrets and isn't published to your function app in Azure. Instead,[add app settings to your function app](functions-develop-vs#function-app-settings).

When you build the project, a folder structure that looks like the following example is generated in the build output directory:

```
<framework.version>
| - bin
| - MyFirstFunction
| | - function.json
| - MySecondFunction
| | - function.json
| - host.json
```


This directory is what gets deployed to your function app in Azure. The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions) of the Functions runtime are [added to the project as NuGet packages](functions-develop-vs?tabs=in-process#add-bindings).

Important

The build process creates a *function.json* file for each function. This *function.json* file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file. To learn how to disable a function, see [How to disable functions](disable-function).

## Methods recognized as functions

In a class library, a function is a method with a `FunctionName`

and a trigger attribute, as shown in the following example:

```
public static class SimpleExample
{
[FunctionName("QueueTrigger")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items")] string myQueueItem,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


The `FunctionName`

attribute marks the method as a function entry point. The name must be unique within a project, start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, `_`

, and `-`

, up to 127 characters in length. Project templates often create a method named `Run`

, but the method name can be any valid C# method name. The preceding example shows a static method being used, but functions aren't required to be static.

The trigger attribute specifies the trigger type and binds input data to a method parameter. The example function is triggered by a queue message, and the queue message is passed to the method in the `myQueueItem`

parameter.

## Method signature parameters

The method signature might contain parameters other than the one used with the trigger attribute. Here are some of the other parameters that you can include:

[Input and output bindings](functions-triggers-bindings)marked as such by decorating them with attributes.- An
`ILogger`

or`TraceWriter`

([version 1.x-only](functions-versions#creating-1x-apps)) parameter for[logging](#logging). - A
`CancellationToken`

parameter for[graceful shutdown](#cancellation-tokens). [Binding expressions](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns)parameters to get trigger metadata.

The order of parameters in the function signature doesn't matter. For example, you can put trigger parameters before or after other bindings, and you can put the logger parameter before or after trigger or binding parameters.

### Output bindings

A function can have zero or multiple output bindings defined by using output parameters.

The following example modifies the preceding one by adding an output queue binding named `myQueueItemCopy`

. The function writes the contents of the message that triggers the function to a new message in a different queue.

```
public static class SimpleExampleWithOutput
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] out string myQueueItemCopy,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CopyQueueMessage function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myQueueItemCopy = myQueueItem;
}
}
```


Values assigned to output bindings are written when the function exits. You can use more than one output binding in a function by assigning values to multiple output parameters.

The binding reference articles ([Storage queues](functions-bindings-storage-queue), for example) explain which parameter types you can use with trigger, input, or output binding attributes.

### Binding expressions example

The following code gets the name of the queue to monitor from an app setting, and it gets the queue message creation time in the `insertionTime`

parameter.

```
public static class BindingExpressionsExample
{
[FunctionName("LogQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("%queueappsetting%")] string myQueueItem,
DateTimeOffset insertionTime,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"Message content: {myQueueItem}");
log.LogInformation($"Created at: {insertionTime}");
}
}
```


## Autogenerated function.json

The build process creates a *function.json* file in a function folder in the build folder. As noted earlier, this file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file.

The purpose of this file is to provide information to the scale controller to use for [scaling decisions on the Consumption plan](event-driven-scaling). For this reason, the file only has trigger info, not input/output bindings.

The generated *function.json* file includes a `configurationSource`

property that tells the runtime to use .NET attributes for bindings, rather than *function.json* configuration. Here's an example:

```
{
"generatedBy": "Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions-1.0.0.0",
"configurationSource": "attributes",
"bindings": [
{
"type": "queueTrigger",
"queueName": "%input-queue-name%",
"name": "myQueueItem"
}
],
"disabled": false,
"scriptFile": "..\\bin\\FunctionApp1.dll",
"entryPoint": "FunctionApp1.QueueTrigger.Run"
}
```


## Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions

The *function.json* file generation is performed by the NuGet package [Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions).

The following example shows the relevant parts of the `.csproj`

files that have different target frameworks of the same `Sdk`

package:

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.5.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```


Important

Starting with version 4.0.6517 of the Core Tools, in-process model projects must reference [version 4.5.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.5.0). If an earlier version is used, the

`func start`

command will error.Among the `Sdk`

package dependencies are triggers and bindings. A 1.x project refers to 1.x triggers and bindings because those triggers and bindings target the .NET Framework, while 4.x triggers and bindings target .NET Core.

The `Sdk`

package also depends on [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json), and indirectly on [WindowsAzure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage). These dependencies make sure that your project uses the versions of those packages that work with the Functions runtime version that the project targets. For example, `Newtonsoft.Json`

has version 11 for .NET Framework 4.6.1, but the Functions runtime that targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 is only compatible with `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1. So your function code in that project also has to use `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1.

The source code for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

is available in the GitHub repo [azure-functions-vs-build-sdk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-vs-build-sdk).

## Local runtime version

Visual Studio uses the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) to run Functions projects on your local computer. The Core Tools is a command-line interface for the Functions runtime.

If you install the Core Tools using the Windows installer (MSI) package or by using npm, it doesn't affect the Core Tools version used by Visual Studio. For the Functions runtime version 1.x, Visual Studio stores Core Tools versions in *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Azure.Functions.Cli* and uses the latest version stored there. For Functions 4.x, the Core Tools are included in the **Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools** extension. For Functions 1.x, you can see what version is being used in the console output when you run a Functions project:

```
[3/1/2018 9:59:53 AM] Starting Host (HostId=contoso2-1518597420, Version=2.0.11353.0, ProcessId=22020, Debug=False, Attempt=0, FunctionsExtensionVersion=)
```


## ReadyToRun

You can compile your function app as [ReadyToRun binaries](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). ReadyToRun is a form of ahead-of-time compilation that can improve startup performance to help reduce the impact of [cold-start](event-driven-scaling#cold-start) when running in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan).

ReadyToRun is available in .NET 6 and later versions and requires [version 4.0 of the Azure Functions runtime](functions-versions).

To compile your project as ReadyToRun, update your project file by adding the `<PublishReadyToRun>`

and `<RuntimeIdentifier>`

elements. The following example is the configuration for publishing to a Windows 32-bit function app.

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
<PublishReadyToRun>true</PublishReadyToRun>
<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x86</RuntimeIdentifier>
</PropertyGroup>
```


Important

Starting in .NET 6, support for Composite ReadyToRun compilation has been added. Check out [ReadyToRun Cross platform and architecture restrictions](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run).

You can also build your app with ReadyToRun from the command line. For more information, see the `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true`

option in [ dotnet publish](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).

## Supported types for bindings

Each binding has its own supported types; for instance, a blob trigger attribute can be applied to a string parameter, a POCO parameter, a `CloudBlockBlob`

parameter, or any of several other supported types. The [binding reference article for blob bindings](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#usage) lists all supported parameter types. For more information, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) and the [binding reference docs for each binding type](functions-triggers-bindings#related-content).

Tip

If you plan to use the HTTP or WebHook bindings, plan to avoid port exhaustion that can be caused by improper instantiation of `HttpClient`

. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

## Binding to method return value

You can use a method return value for an output binding, by applying the attribute to the method return value. For examples, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings).

Use the return value only if a successful function execution always results in a return value to pass to the output binding. Otherwise, use `ICollector`

or `IAsyncCollector`

, as shown in the following section.

## Writing multiple output values

To write multiple values to an output binding, or if a successful function invocation might not result in anything to pass to the output binding, use the [ ICollector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs) or

[types. These types are write-only collections that are written to the output binding when the method completes.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)

`IAsyncCollector`

This example writes multiple queue messages into the same queue using `ICollector`

:

```
public static class ICollectorExample
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessageICollector")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-3")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] ICollector<string> myDestinationQueue,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 1: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 2: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


## Async

To make a function [asynchronous](/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/), use the `async`

keyword and return a `Task`

object.

```
public static class AsyncExample
{
[FunctionName("BlobCopy")]
public static async Task RunAsync(
[BlobTrigger("sample-images/{blobName}")] Stream blobInput,
[Blob("sample-images-copies/{blobName}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream blobOutput,
CancellationToken token,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"BlobCopy function processed.");
await blobInput.CopyToAsync(blobOutput, 4096, token);
}
}
```


You can't use `out`

parameters in async functions. For output bindings, use the [function return value](#binding-to-method-return-value) or a [collector object](#writing-multiple-output-values) instead.

## Cancellation tokens

A function can accept a [CancellationToken](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) parameter, which enables the operating system to notify your code when the function is about to be terminated. You can use this notification to make sure the function doesn't terminate unexpectedly in a way that leaves data in an inconsistent state.

Consider the case when you have a function that processes messages in batches. The following Azure Service Bus-triggered function processes an array of [ServiceBusReceivedMessage](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusreceivedmessage) objects, which represents a batch of incoming messages to be processed by a specific function invocation:

```
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
using System.Threading;
namespace ServiceBusCancellationToken
{
public static class servicebus
{
[FunctionName("servicebus")]
public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("csharpguitar", Connection = "SB_CONN")]
ServiceBusReceivedMessage[] messages, CancellationToken cancellationToken, ILogger log)
{
try
{
foreach (var message in messages)
{
if (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
log.LogInformation("A cancellation token was received. Taking precautionary actions.");
//Take precautions like noting how far along you are with processing the batch
log.LogInformation("Precautionary activities --complete--.");
break;
}
else
{
//business logic as usual
log.LogInformation($"Message: {message} was processed.");
}
}
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
log.LogInformation($"Something unexpected happened: {ex.Message}");
}
}
}
}
```


## Logging

In your function code, you can write output to logs that appear as traces in Application Insights. The recommended way to write to the logs is to include a parameter of type [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger), which is typically named `log`

. Version 1.x of the Functions runtime used `TraceWriter`

, which also writes to Application Insights, but doesn't support structured logging. Don't use `Console.Write`

to write your logs, since this data isn't captured by Application Insights.

### ILogger

In your function definition, include an [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger) parameter, which supports [structured logging](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/312197/benefits-of-structured-logging-vs-basic-logging).

With an `ILogger`

object, you call `Log<level>`

[extension methods on ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggerextensions#methods) to create logs. The following code writes `Information`

logs with category `Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User.`

:

```
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger logger)
{
logger.LogInformation("Request for item with key={itemKey}.", id);
```


To learn more about how Functions implements `ILogger`

, see [Collecting telemetry data](functions-monitoring#collecting-telemetry-data). Categories prefixed with `Function`

assume you're using an `ILogger`

instance. If you choose to instead use an `ILogger<T>`

, the category name might instead be based on `T`

.

### Structured logging

The order of placeholders, not their names, determines which parameters are used in the log message. Suppose you have the following code:

```
string partitionKey = "partitionKey";
string rowKey = "rowKey";
logger.LogInformation("partitionKey={partitionKey}, rowKey={rowKey}", partitionKey, rowKey);
```


If you keep the same message string and reverse the order of the parameters, the resulting message text would have the values in the wrong places.

Placeholders are handled this way so that you can do structured logging. Application Insights stores the parameter name-value pairs and the message string. The result is that the message arguments become fields that you can query on.

If your logger method call looks like the previous example, you can query the field `customDimensions.prop__rowKey`

. The `prop__`

prefix is added to ensure there are no collisions between fields the runtime adds and fields your function code adds.

You can also query on the original message string by referencing the field `customDimensions.prop__{OriginalFormat}`

.

Here's a sample JSON representation of `customDimensions`

data:

```
{
"customDimensions": {
"prop__{OriginalFormat}":"C# Queue trigger function processed: {message}",
"Category":"Function",
"LogLevel":"Information",
"prop__message":"c9519cbf-b1e6-4b9b-bf24-cb7d10b1bb89"
}
}
```


### Log custom telemetry

There's a Functions-specific version of the Application Insights SDK that you can use to send custom telemetry data from your functions to Application Insights: [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights). Use the following command from the command prompt to install this package:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights --version <VERSION>
```


In this command, replace `<VERSION>`

with a version of this package that supports your installed version of [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/).

The following C# examples uses the [custom telemetry API](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics). The example is for a .NET class library, but the Application Insights code is the same for C# script.

Version 2.x and later versions of the runtime use newer features in Application Insights to automatically correlate telemetry with the current operation. There's no need to manually set the operation `Id`

, `ParentId`

, or `Name`

fields.

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
using System.Linq;
namespace functionapp0915
{
public class HttpTrigger2
{
private readonly TelemetryClient telemetryClient;
/// Using dependency injection will guarantee that you use the same configuration for telemetry collected automatically and manually.
public HttpTrigger2(TelemetryConfiguration telemetryConfiguration)
{
this.telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(telemetryConfiguration);
}
[FunctionName("HttpTrigger2")]
public Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)]
HttpRequest req, ExecutionContext context, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
DateTime start = DateTime.UtcNow;
// Parse query parameter
string name = req.Query
.FirstOrDefault(q => string.Compare(q.Key, "name", true) == 0)
.Value;
// Write an event to the customEvents table.
var evt = new EventTelemetry("Function called");
evt.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackEvent(evt);
// Generate a custom metric, in this case let's use ContentLength.
this.telemetryClient.GetMetric("contentLength").TrackValue(req.ContentLength);
// Log a custom dependency in the dependencies table.
var dependency = new DependencyTelemetry
{
Name = "GET api/planets/1/",
Target = "swapi.co",
Data = "https://swapi.co/api/planets/1/",
Timestamp = start,
Duration = DateTime.UtcNow - start,
Success = true
};
dependency.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackDependency(dependency);
return Task.FromResult<IActionResult>(new OkResult());
}
}
}
```


In this example, the custom metric data gets aggregated by the host before being sent to the customMetrics table. To learn more, see the [GetMetric](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#getmetric) documentation in Application Insights.

When running locally, you must add the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`

setting, with the Application Insights key, to the [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file.

Don't call `TrackRequest`

or `StartOperation<RequestTelemetry>`

because you see duplicate requests for a function invocation. The Functions runtime automatically tracks requests.

Don't set `telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id`

. This global setting causes incorrect correlation when many functions are running simultaneously. Instead, create a new telemetry instance (`DependencyTelemetry`

, `EventTelemetry`

) and modify its `Context`

property. Then pass in the telemetry instance to the corresponding `Track`

method on `TelemetryClient`

(`TrackDependency()`

, `TrackEvent()`

, `TrackMetric()`

). This method ensures that the telemetry has the correct correlation details for the current function invocation.

## Testing functions

The following articles show how to run an in-process C# class library function locally for testing purposes:

## Environment variables

To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`

, as shown in the following code example:

```
public static class EnvironmentVariablesExample
{
[FunctionName("GetEnvironmentVariables")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));
}
private static string GetEnvironmentVariable(string name)
{
return name + ": " +
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
}
}
```


App settings can be read from environment variables both when developing locally and when running in Azure. When developing locally, app settings come from the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. In both environments, local and Azure, `GetEnvironmentVariable("<app setting name>")`

retrieves the value of the named app setting. For instance, when you're running locally, "My Site Name" would be returned if your *local.settings.json* file contains `{ "Values": { "WEBSITE_SITE_NAME": "My Site Name" } }`

.

The [System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings) property is an alternative API for getting app setting values, but we recommend that you use `GetEnvironmentVariable`

as shown here.

## Binding at runtime

In C# and other .NET languages, you can use an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) binding pattern, as opposed to the [ declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) bindings in attributes. Imperative binding is useful when binding parameters need to be computed at runtime rather than design time. With this pattern, you can bind to supported input and output bindings on-the-fly in your function code.

Define an imperative binding as follows:

**Do not**include an attribute in the function signature for your desired imperative bindings.Pass in an input parameter

or`Binder binder`

.`IBinder binder`

Use the following C# pattern to perform the data binding.

`using (var output = await binder.BindAsync<T>(new BindingTypeAttribute(...))) { ... }`

`BindingTypeAttribute`

is the .NET attribute that defines your binding, and`T`

is an input or output type that's supported by that binding type.`T`

can't be an`out`

parameter type (such as`out JObject`

). For example, the Mobile Apps table output binding supports[six output types](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.MobileApps/MobileTableAttribute.cs#L17-L22), but you can only use[ICollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs)or[IAsyncCollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)with imperative binding.

### Single attribute example

The following example code creates a [Storage blob output binding](functions-bindings-storage-blob-output) with blob path that's defined at run time, then writes a string to the blob.

```
public static class IBinderExample
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobUsingBinder")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-4")] string myQueueItem,
IBinder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobUsingBinder function processed: {myQueueItem}");
using (var writer = binder.Bind<TextWriter>(new BlobAttribute(
$"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write)))
{
writer.Write("Hello World!");
};
}
}
```


[BlobAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage/Blobs/BlobAttribute.cs) defines the [Storage blob](functions-bindings-storage-blob) input or output binding, and [TextWriter](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.textwriter) is a supported output binding type.

### Multiple attributes example

The preceding example gets the app setting for the function app's main Storage account connection string (which is `AzureWebJobsStorage`

). You can specify a custom app setting to use for the Storage account by adding the [StorageAccountAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/StorageAccountAttribute.cs) and passing the attribute array into `BindAsync<T>()`

. Use a `Binder`

parameter, not `IBinder`

. For example:

```
public static class IBinderExampleMultipleAttributes
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount")]
public async static Task RunAsync(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-binder2")] string myQueueItem,
Binder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount function processed: {myQueueItem}");
var attributes = new Attribute[]
{
new BlobAttribute($"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write),
new StorageAccountAttribute("MyStorageAccount")
};
using (var writer = await binder.BindAsync<TextWriter>(attributes))
{
await writer.WriteAsync("Hello World!!");
}
}
}
```


## Triggers and bindings

This table shows the bindings that are supported in the major versions of the Azure Functions runtime:

| Type | 4.x1 |
1.x2 |
Trigger | Input | Output |

# Quickstart: Build a custom remote MCP server using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you create a custom remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server from a template project using the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`

). The MCP server uses the Azure Functions MCP server extension to provide tools for AI models, agents, and assistants. After running the project locally and verifying your code using GitHub Copilot, you deploy it to a new serverless function app in Azure Functions that follows current best practices for secure and scalable deployments.

Tip

Functions also enables you to deploy an existing MCP server code project to a Flex Consumption plan app without having to make changes to your code project. For more information, see [Quickstart: Host existing MCP servers on Azure Functions](scenario-host-mcp-server-sdks).

Because the new app runs on the Flex Consumption plan, which follows a *pay-for-what-you-use* billing model, completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Important

While [creating custom MCP servers](functions-bindings-mcp) is supported for all Functions languages, this quickstart scenario currently only has examples for C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete this quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

This article supports version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions.

This article supports version 2 of the Python programming model for Azure Functions.

## Prerequisites

[Java 17 Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)- If you use another
[supported version of Java](supported-languages?pivots=programming-language-java#languages-by-runtime-version), you must update the project's pom.xml file. - Set the
`JAVA_HOME`

environment variable to the install location of the correct version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

- If you use another
[Apache Maven 3.8.x](https://maven.apache.org)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)with these extensions:[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)and attempts to install it when not available.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can also run Azure CLI commands in[Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview).An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Initialize the project

Use the `azd init`

command to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

- In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace where you want to create your project.

In the Terminal, run this

`azd init`

command:`azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-dotnet -e mcpserver-dotnet`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command:`azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-java -e mcpserver-java`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-java)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command:`azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-typescript -e mcpserver-ts`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command:`azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-python -e mcpserver-python`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-python)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

## Start the storage emulator

Use the Azurite emulator to simulate an Azure Storage account connection when running your code project locally.

If you haven't already,

[install Azurite](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite#install-azurite).Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run the command`Azurite: Start`

to start the local storage emulator.

## Run your MCP server locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer by using the Azurite emulator.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel, and you can see the name of the functions that are running locally.Make a note of the local MCP server endpoint (like

`http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp`

), which you use to configure GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

## Verify using GitHub Copilot

To verify your code, add the running project as an MCP server for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code:

Press

`F1`. In the command palette, search for and run**MCP: Add Server**.Choose

**HTTP (Server-Sent Events)**for the transport type.Enter the URL of the MCP endpoint you copied in the previous step.

Use the generated

**Server ID**and select**Workspace**to save the MCP server connection to your Workspace settings.Open the command palette and run

**MCP: List Servers**and verify that the server you added is listed and running.In Copilot chat, select

**Agent**mode and run this prompt:`Say Hello`

When prompted to run the tool, select

**Allow in this Workspace**so you don't have to keep granting permission. The prompt runs and returns a`Hello World`

response and function execution information is written to the logs.Now, select some code in one of your project files and run this prompt:

`Save this snippet as snippet1`

Copilot stores the snippet and responds to your request with information about how to retrieve the snippet by using the

`getSnippets`

tool. Again, you can review the function execution in the logs and verify that the`saveSnippets`

function ran.In Copilot chat, run this prompt:

`Retrieve snippet1 and apply to NewFile`

Copilot retrieves the snippets, adds it to a file called

`NewFile`

, and does whatever else it thinks is needed to make the code snippet work in your project. The Functions logs show that the`getSnippets`

endpoint was called.When you're done testing, press Ctrl+C to stop the Functions host.


## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the MCP server tools:

The function code for the MCP server tools is defined in the `src`

folder. The `McpToolTrigger`

attribute exposes the functions as MCP Server tools:

```
[Function(nameof(SayHello))]
public string SayHello(
[McpToolTrigger(HelloToolName, HelloToolDescription)] ToolInvocationContext context
)
{
logger.LogInformation("C# MCP tool trigger function processed a request.");
return "Hello I am MCP Tool!";
}
```


```
[Function(nameof(GetSnippet))]
public object GetSnippet(
[McpToolTrigger(GetSnippetToolName, GetSnippetToolDescription)]
ToolInvocationContext context,
[BlobInput(BlobPath)] string snippetContent
)
{
return snippetContent;
}
[Function(nameof(SaveSnippet))]
[BlobOutput(BlobPath)]
public string SaveSnippet(
[McpToolTrigger(SaveSnippetToolName, SaveSnippetToolDescription)]
ToolInvocationContext context,
[McpToolProperty(SnippetNamePropertyName, SnippetNamePropertyDescription, true)]
string name,
[McpToolProperty(SnippetPropertyName, SnippetPropertyDescription, true)]
string snippet
)
{
return snippet;
}
}
```


You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions .NET MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet) GitHub repository.

The function code for the MCP server tools is defined in the `src/main/java/com/function/`

folder. The `@McpToolTrigger`

annotation exposes the functions as MCP Server tools:

```

```


```
// Write the snippet content to the output blob
outputBlob.setValue(snippet);
return "Successfully saved snippet '" + snippetName + "' with " + snippet.length() + " characters.";
}
/**

```


You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions Python MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-python) GitHub repository.

The function code for the MCP server tools is defined in the `src`

folder. The MCP function registration exposes these functions as MCP Server tools:

```
export async function mcpToolHello(_toolArguments:unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
console.log(_toolArguments);
// Get name from the tool arguments
const mcptoolargs = context.triggerMetadata.mcptoolargs as {
name?: string;
};
const name = mcptoolargs?.name;
console.info(`Hello ${name}, I am MCP Tool!`);
return `Hello ${name || 'World'}, I am MCP Tool!`;
}
// Register the hello tool
app.mcpTool('hello', {
toolName: 'hello',
description: 'Simple hello world MCP Tool that responses with a hello message.',
toolProperties:{
name: arg.string().describe('Required property to identify the caller.').optional()
},
handler: mcpToolHello
});
```


```
// SaveSnippet function - saves a snippet with a name
export async function saveSnippet(
_toolArguments: unknown,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<string> {
console.info("Saving snippet");
// Get snippet name and content from the tool arguments
const mcptoolargs = context.triggerMetadata.mcptoolargs as {
snippetname?: string;
snippet?: string;
};
const snippetName = mcptoolargs?.snippetname;
const snippet = mcptoolargs?.snippet;
if (!snippetName) {
return "No snippet name provided";
}
if (!snippet) {
return "No snippet content provided";
}
// Save the snippet to blob storage using the output binding
context.extraOutputs.set(blobOutputBinding, snippet);
console.info(`Saved snippet: ${snippetName}`);
return snippet;
}
```


You can view the complete project template in the [Azure Functions TypeScript MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript) GitHub repository.

After verifying the MCP server tools locally, you can publish the project to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

This project is configured to use the `azd up`

command to deploy this project to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure. The project includes a set of Bicep files that `azd`

uses to create a secure deployment to a Flex consumption plan that follows best practices.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Package, Provison and Deploy (up)`

. Then, sign in by using your Azure account.If you're not already signed in, authenticate with your Azure account.

When prompted, provide these required deployment parameters:

Parameter Description *Azure subscription*Subscription in which your resources are created. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. After the command completes successfully, you see links to the resources you created.


## Connect to your remote MCP server

Your MCP server is now running in Azure. When you access the tools, you need to include a system key in your request. This key provides a degree of access control for clients accessing your remote MCP server. After you get this key, you can connect GitHub Copilot to your remote server.

Run this script that uses

`azd`

and the Azure CLI to print out both the MCP server URL and the system key (`mcp_extension`

) required to access the tools:`eval $(azd env get-values --output dotenv) MCP_EXTENSION_KEY=$(az functionapp keys list --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AZURE_FUNCTION_NAME --query "systemKeys.mcp_extension" -o tsv) printf "MCP Server URL: %s\n" "https://$SERVICE_API_NAME.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp" printf "MCP Server key: %s\n" "$MCP_EXTENSION_KEY"`

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuraton`

, which opens the`mcp.json`

configuration file.In the

`mcp.json`

configuration, find the named MCP server you added earlier, change the`url`

value to your remote MCP server URL, and add a`headers.x-functions-key`

element, which contains your copied MCP server access key, as in this example:`{ "servers": { "remote-mcp-function": { "type": "http", "url": "https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp", "headers": { "x-functions-key": "A1bC2dE3fH4iJ5kL6mN7oP8qR9sT0u..." } } } }`

Select the

**Start**button above your server name in the open`mcp.json`

to restart the remote MCP server, this time using your deployed app.

## Verify your deployment

You can now have GitHub Copilot use your remote MCP tools just as you did locally, but now the code runs securely in Azure. Replay the same commands you used earlier to ensure everything works correctly.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your MCP server and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure to avoid incurring further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without confirmation from you. This command doesn't affect your local code project.

# Azure Functions runtime versions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure Functions currently supports two versions of the runtime host. The following table details the currently supported runtime versions, their support level, and when they should be used:]

| Version | Support level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 4.x | GA | Check out Recommended runtime version for functions in all languages.
|
| 1.x | GA (
|

**Support will end for version 1.x on September 14, 2026.**We highly recommend you[migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4?pivots=programming-language-csharp), which supports .NET Framework 4.8, .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10 Preview.Important

As of December 13, 2022, function apps running on versions 2.x and 3.x of the Azure Functions runtime reached the end of extended support. For more information, see [Retired versions](#retired-versions).

This article details some of the differences between supported versions, how you can create each version, and how to change the version on which your functions run.

## Levels of support

There are two levels of support:

**Generally available (GA)**- Fully supported and approved for production use.**Preview**- Not yet supported, but expected to reach GA status in the future.

## Languages

All functions in a function app must share the same language. You choose the language of functions in your function app when you create the app. The language of your function app is maintained in the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_runtime) setting, and can't be changed when there are existing functions.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the [top of the article](#top).

The following table shows the .NET versions supported by Azure Functions.

The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your selected execution model.

Your function app code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#supported-versions). For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
|---|---|---|
| .NET 10 | GA |
|

For information about the language versions of previously supported versions of the Functions runtime, see [Retired runtime versions](language-support-policy#language-support-related-resources).

## Run on a specific version

The version of the Functions runtime used by published apps in Azure is dictated by the [ FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION](functions-app-settings#functions_extension_version) application setting. In some cases and for certain languages, other settings can apply.

By default, function apps created in the Azure portal, by the Azure CLI, or from Visual Studio tools are set to version 4.x. You can modify this version if needed. You can only downgrade the runtime version to 1.x after you create your function app but before you add any functions. Updating to a later major version is allowed even with apps that have existing functions.

### Migrating existing function apps

When your app has existing functions, you must take precautions before moving to a later major runtime version. The following articles detail breaking changes between major versions, including language-specific breaking changes. They also provide you with step-by-step instructions for a successful migration of your existing function app.

### Changing the version of apps in Azure

The following major runtime version values are used:

| Value | Runtime target |
|---|---|
`~4` |
4.x |
`~1` |
1.x |

Important

Don't arbitrarily change this app setting, because other app setting changes and changes to your function code might be required. For existing function apps, follow the [migration instructions](#migrating-existing-function-apps).

### Pinning to a specific minor version

To resolve issues that your function app could have when running on the latest major version, you must temporarily pin your app to a specific minor version. Pinning gives you time to get your app running correctly on the latest major version. The way that you pin to a minor version differs between Windows and Linux. To learn more, see [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version).

Older minor versions are periodically removed from Functions. For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

## Minimum extension versions

There's technically not a correlation between binding extension versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for all trigger and binding extensions.

If you receive a warning about a package not meeting a minimum required version, you should update that NuGet package to the minimum version as you normally would. The minimum version requirements for extensions used in Functions v4.x can be found in [the linked configuration file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script/extensionrequirements.json).

For C# script, update the extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


There's technically not a correlation between extension bundle versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for extension bundles.

If you receive a warning about your extension bundle version not meeting a minimum required version, update your existing extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


To learn more about extension bundles, see [Extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Retired versions

Important

[Support will end for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) for full support.

These versions of the Functions runtime reached the end of extended support on December 13, 2022.

| Version | Current support level | Previous support level |
|---|---|---|
| 3.x | Out of support | GA |
| 2.x | Out of support | GA |

As soon as possible, you should migrate your apps to version 4.x to obtain full support. For a complete set of language-specific migration instructions, see [Migrate apps to Azure Functions version 4.x](migrate-version-3-version-4).

Apps using versions 2.x and 3.x can still be created and deployed from your CI/CD DevOps pipeline, and all existing apps continue to run without breaking changes. However, your apps aren't eligible for new features, security patches, and performance optimizations. You can only get related service support after you upgrade your apps to version 4.x.

Versions 2.x and 3.x are no longer supported due to the end of support for .NET Core 3.1, which was a core dependency. This requirement affects all [languages supported by Azure Functions](supported-languages).

## Locally developed application versions

You can make the following updates to function apps to locally change the targeted versions.

### Visual Studio runtime versions

In Visual Studio, you select the runtime version when you create a project. Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio supports the two major runtime versions. The correct version is used when debugging and publishing based on project settings. The version settings are defined in the *.csproj* file in the following properties:

```
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```


If you're using the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), you can choose, `net9.0`

, `net8.0`

, or `net48`

as the target framework. You can also choose to use [preview support](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#preview-net-versions) for `net10.0`

. If you're using the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), you can choose `net8.0`

or `net6.0`

, and you must include the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

extension set to at least `4.4.0`

. .NET 10 is not supported by the in-process model; if you are on the in-process model and wish to use .NET 10, [migrate your app to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

.NET 6 was previously supported on the isolated worker model and the in-process model, but it reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).
.NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [May 14, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).

### Visual Studio Code and Azure Functions Core Tools

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local) is used for command-line development and also by the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Install the Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

For Visual Studio Code development, you might also need to update the user setting for the `azureFunctions.projectRuntime`

to match the version of the tools installed. This setting also updates the templates and languages used during function app creation.

## Bindings

Starting with version 2.x, the runtime uses a new [binding extensibility model](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/wiki/Binding-Extensions-Overview) that offers these advantages:

Support for non-Microsoft binding extensions.

Decoupling of runtime and bindings. This change allows binding extensions to be versioned and released independently. You can, for example, opt to upgrade to a version of an extension that relies on a newer version of an underlying SDK.

A lighter execution environment, where only the bindings in use are known and loaded by the runtime.


Except for HTTP and timer triggers, all bindings must be explicitly added to the function app project, or registered in the portal. For more information, see [Azure Functions binding expression patterns](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns).

This table shows the bindings that are supported in the major versions of the Azure Functions runtime:

| Type | 4.x1 |
1.x2 |
Trigger | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|

[Azure Cosmos DB](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2)[Azure Data Explorer](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer)[Azure SQL](functions-bindings-azure-sql)[Dapr](functions-bindings-dapr)4[Event Grid](functions-bindings-event-grid)[Event Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs)[HTTP and webhooks](functions-bindings-http-webhook)[IoT Hub](functions-bindings-event-iot)[Kafka](functions-bindings-kafka)3[Mobile Apps](functions-bindings-mobile-apps)[Model Context Protocol](functions-bindings-mcp)[Notification Hubs](functions-bindings-notification-hubs)[Queue Storage](functions-bindings-storage-queue)[Redis](functions-bindings-cache)[RabbitMQ](functions-bindings-rabbitmq)3[SendGrid](functions-bindings-sendgrid)[Service Bus](functions-bindings-service-bus)[Azure SignalR Service](functions-bindings-signalr-service)[Table Storage](functions-bindings-storage-table)[Timer](functions-bindings-timer)[Twilio](functions-bindings-twilio)- Register all bindings except HTTP and timer. See
[Register Azure Functions binding extensions](functions-bindings-register). This step isn't required when using version 1.x of the Functions runtime. [Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1).[Migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4)for full support.- Triggers aren't supported in the Consumption plan. This binding type requires
[runtime-driven triggers](functions-networking-options#elastic-premium-plan-with-virtual-network-triggers). - This binding type is supported in Kubernetes, Azure IoT Edge, and other self-hosted modes only.

## Function app timeout duration

The `functionTimeout`

property in the [host.json](functions-host-json#functiontimeout) project file sets the timeout duration for functions in a function app. This property applies specifically to function executions. After the trigger starts function execution, the function needs to return or respond within the timeout duration. When an execution exceeds this duration, a timeout error occurs and the language worker process restarts. For C# apps running in-process, the host process itself restarts. To avoid timeouts and subsequent process restarts, it's important to [write robust functions](functions-best-practices#write-robust-functions). For more information, see [Improve Azure Functions performance and reliability](performance-reliability#make-sure-background-tasks-complete).

The following table shows the default and maximum values (in minutes) for specific plans:

| Plan | Default | Maximum1 |
|---|---|---|
|
30 | Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded3 |
|
30 | Unbounded5 |
|
5 | 10 |

- Regardless of the function app timeout setting, 230 seconds is the maximum amount of time that an HTTP triggered function can take to respond to a request. This limit exists because of the
[default idle timeout of Azure Load Balancer](../app-service/faq-availability-performance-application-issues#why-does-my-request-time-out-after-230-seconds). For longer processing times, consider using the[Durable Functions async pattern](durable/durable-functions-overview#async-http)or[defer the actual work and return an immediate response](performance-reliability#avoid-long-running-functions). - There's no maximum execution timeout duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes
[during scale in](event-driven-scaling#scale-in-behaviors)for the Flex Consumption and Premium plans, and a grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - Requires the App Service plan be set to
[Always On](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - The default timeout for version 1.x of the Functions host runtime is
*unbounded*. - When the
[minimum number of replicas](../container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition)is set to zero, the default timeout depends on the specific triggers used in the app.

These values assume that the Azure Functions host process starts and runs correctly. There's a maximum timeout of 60 seconds for the language-specific worker process to also start. The worker process startup timeout isn't currently configurable.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This article is an introduction to developing Azure Functions by using C# in .NET class libraries. These class libraries are used to run *in-process with the Functions runtime*. Your .NET functions can alternatively run _isolated from the Functions *runtime*, which offers several advantages. To learn more, see [the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). For a comprehensive comparison between these two models, see [Differences between the in-process model and the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

Important

This article supports .NET class library functions that run in-process with the runtime. Your C# functions can also run out-of-process and isolated from the Functions runtime. The isolated worker process model is the only way to run non-LTS versions of .NET and .NET Framework apps in current versions of the Functions runtime. To learn more, see [.NET isolated worker process functions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Azure Functions supports C# and C# script programming languages. If you're looking for guidance on [using C# in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal), see [C# script (.csx) developer reference](functions-reference-csharp).

## Supported versions

Versions of the Functions runtime support specific versions of .NET. To learn more about Functions versions, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions). Version support also depends on whether your functions run in-process or isolated worker process.

Note

To learn how to change the Functions runtime version used by your function app, see [view and update the current runtime version](set-runtime-version#view-the-current-runtime-version).

The following table shows the highest level of .NET or .NET Framework that can be used with a specific version of Functions.

| Functions runtime version |

3 Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

4 Support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

5 You can't run .NET 10 apps on Linux in the Consumption plan. To run on Linux, you should instead use the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). For step-by-step migration instructions, see [Migrate Consumption plan apps to the Flex Consumption plan](migration/migrate-plan-consumption-to-flex?pivots=platform-linux).

For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

### Updating to target .NET 8

Apps using the in-process model can target .NET 8 by following the steps outlined in this section. However, if you choose to exercise this option, you should still begin planning your [migration to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) in advance of [support ending for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model).

Many apps can change the configuration of the function app in Azure without updates to code or redeployment. To run .NET 8 with the in-process model, three configurations are required:

- The
[application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings)`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

must be set with the value "dotnet". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

must be set with the value "~4". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

must be set with the value "1". - You must
[update the stack configuration](update-language-versions#update-the-stack-configuration)to reference .NET 8.

Support for .NET 8 still uses version 4.x of the Functions runtime, and no change to the configured runtime version is required.

To update your local project, first make sure you're using the latest versions of local tools. Then ensure that the project references [version 4.4.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.4.0). You can then change your `TargetFramework`

to "net8.0". You must also update `local.settings.json`

to include both `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

set to "dotnet" and `FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

set to "1".

The following example is a minimal `project`

file with these changes:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.4.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<None Update="host.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</None>
<None Update="local.settings.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
<CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


The following example is a minimal `local.settings.json`

file with these changes:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED": "1",
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
}
}
```


If your app uses [ Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions), ensure it targets version 1.5.3 or later. Due to a behavior change in .NET 8, apps with older versions of the package throw an ambiguous constructor exception.

You might need to make other changes to your app based on the version support of its other dependencies.

Version 4.x of the Functions runtime provides equivalent functionality for .NET 6 and .NET 8. The in-process model doesn't include other features or updates that integrate with new .NET 8 capabilities. For example, the runtime doesn't support keyed services. To take full advantage of the latest .NET 8 capabilities and enhancements, you must [migrate to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

## Functions class library project

In Visual Studio, the **Azure Functions** project template creates a C# class library project that contains the following files:

[host.json](functions-host-json)- stores configuration settings that affect all functions in the project when running locally or in Azure.[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)- stores app settings and connection strings that are used when running locally. This file contains secrets and isn't published to your function app in Azure. Instead,[add app settings to your function app](functions-develop-vs#function-app-settings).

When you build the project, a folder structure that looks like the following example is generated in the build output directory:

```
<framework.version>
| - bin
| - MyFirstFunction
| | - function.json
| - MySecondFunction
| | - function.json
| - host.json
```


This directory is what gets deployed to your function app in Azure. The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions) of the Functions runtime are [added to the project as NuGet packages](functions-develop-vs?tabs=in-process#add-bindings).

Important

The build process creates a *function.json* file for each function. This *function.json* file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file. To learn how to disable a function, see [How to disable functions](disable-function).

## Methods recognized as functions

In a class library, a function is a method with a `FunctionName`

and a trigger attribute, as shown in the following example:

```
public static class SimpleExample
{
[FunctionName("QueueTrigger")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items")] string myQueueItem,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


The `FunctionName`

attribute marks the method as a function entry point. The name must be unique within a project, start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, `_`

, and `-`

, up to 127 characters in length. Project templates often create a method named `Run`

, but the method name can be any valid C# method name. The preceding example shows a static method being used, but functions aren't required to be static.

The trigger attribute specifies the trigger type and binds input data to a method parameter. The example function is triggered by a queue message, and the queue message is passed to the method in the `myQueueItem`

parameter.

## Method signature parameters

The method signature might contain parameters other than the one used with the trigger attribute. Here are some of the other parameters that you can include:

[Input and output bindings](functions-triggers-bindings)marked as such by decorating them with attributes.- An
`ILogger`

or`TraceWriter`

([version 1.x-only](functions-versions#creating-1x-apps)) parameter for[logging](#logging). - A
`CancellationToken`

parameter for[graceful shutdown](#cancellation-tokens). [Binding expressions](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns)parameters to get trigger metadata.

The order of parameters in the function signature doesn't matter. For example, you can put trigger parameters before or after other bindings, and you can put the logger parameter before or after trigger or binding parameters.

### Output bindings

A function can have zero or multiple output bindings defined by using output parameters.

The following example modifies the preceding one by adding an output queue binding named `myQueueItemCopy`

. The function writes the contents of the message that triggers the function to a new message in a different queue.

```
public static class SimpleExampleWithOutput
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] out string myQueueItemCopy,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CopyQueueMessage function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myQueueItemCopy = myQueueItem;
}
}
```


Values assigned to output bindings are written when the function exits. You can use more than one output binding in a function by assigning values to multiple output parameters.

The binding reference articles ([Storage queues](functions-bindings-storage-queue), for example) explain which parameter types you can use with trigger, input, or output binding attributes.

### Binding expressions example

The following code gets the name of the queue to monitor from an app setting, and it gets the queue message creation time in the `insertionTime`

parameter.

```
public static class BindingExpressionsExample
{
[FunctionName("LogQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("%queueappsetting%")] string myQueueItem,
DateTimeOffset insertionTime,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"Message content: {myQueueItem}");
log.LogInformation($"Created at: {insertionTime}");
}
}
```


## Autogenerated function.json

The build process creates a *function.json* file in a function folder in the build folder. As noted earlier, this file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file.

The purpose of this file is to provide information to the scale controller to use for [scaling decisions on the Consumption plan](event-driven-scaling). For this reason, the file only has trigger info, not input/output bindings.

The generated *function.json* file includes a `configurationSource`

property that tells the runtime to use .NET attributes for bindings, rather than *function.json* configuration. Here's an example:

```
{
"generatedBy": "Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions-1.0.0.0",
"configurationSource": "attributes",
"bindings": [
{
"type": "queueTrigger",
"queueName": "%input-queue-name%",
"name": "myQueueItem"
}
],
"disabled": false,
"scriptFile": "..\\bin\\FunctionApp1.dll",
"entryPoint": "FunctionApp1.QueueTrigger.Run"
}
```


## Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions

The *function.json* file generation is performed by the NuGet package [Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions).

The following example shows the relevant parts of the `.csproj`

files that have different target frameworks of the same `Sdk`

package:

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.5.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```


Important

Starting with version 4.0.6517 of the Core Tools, in-process model projects must reference [version 4.5.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.5.0). If an earlier version is used, the

`func start`

command will error.Among the `Sdk`

package dependencies are triggers and bindings. A 1.x project refers to 1.x triggers and bindings because those triggers and bindings target the .NET Framework, while 4.x triggers and bindings target .NET Core.

The `Sdk`

package also depends on [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json), and indirectly on [WindowsAzure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage). These dependencies make sure that your project uses the versions of those packages that work with the Functions runtime version that the project targets. For example, `Newtonsoft.Json`

has version 11 for .NET Framework 4.6.1, but the Functions runtime that targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 is only compatible with `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1. So your function code in that project also has to use `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1.

The source code for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

is available in the GitHub repo [azure-functions-vs-build-sdk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-vs-build-sdk).

## Local runtime version

Visual Studio uses the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) to run Functions projects on your local computer. The Core Tools is a command-line interface for the Functions runtime.

If you install the Core Tools using the Windows installer (MSI) package or by using npm, it doesn't affect the Core Tools version used by Visual Studio. For the Functions runtime version 1.x, Visual Studio stores Core Tools versions in *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Azure.Functions.Cli* and uses the latest version stored there. For Functions 4.x, the Core Tools are included in the **Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools** extension. For Functions 1.x, you can see what version is being used in the console output when you run a Functions project:

```
[3/1/2018 9:59:53 AM] Starting Host (HostId=contoso2-1518597420, Version=2.0.11353.0, ProcessId=22020, Debug=False, Attempt=0, FunctionsExtensionVersion=)
```


## ReadyToRun

You can compile your function app as [ReadyToRun binaries](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). ReadyToRun is a form of ahead-of-time compilation that can improve startup performance to help reduce the impact of [cold-start](event-driven-scaling#cold-start) when running in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan).

ReadyToRun is available in .NET 6 and later versions and requires [version 4.0 of the Azure Functions runtime](functions-versions).

To compile your project as ReadyToRun, update your project file by adding the `<PublishReadyToRun>`

and `<RuntimeIdentifier>`

elements. The following example is the configuration for publishing to a Windows 32-bit function app.

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
<PublishReadyToRun>true</PublishReadyToRun>
<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x86</RuntimeIdentifier>
</PropertyGroup>
```


Important

Starting in .NET 6, support for Composite ReadyToRun compilation has been added. Check out [ReadyToRun Cross platform and architecture restrictions](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run).

You can also build your app with ReadyToRun from the command line. For more information, see the `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true`

option in [ dotnet publish](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).

## Supported types for bindings

Each binding has its own supported types; for instance, a blob trigger attribute can be applied to a string parameter, a POCO parameter, a `CloudBlockBlob`

parameter, or any of several other supported types. The [binding reference article for blob bindings](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#usage) lists all supported parameter types. For more information, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) and the [binding reference docs for each binding type](functions-triggers-bindings#related-content).

Tip

If you plan to use the HTTP or WebHook bindings, plan to avoid port exhaustion that can be caused by improper instantiation of `HttpClient`

. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

## Binding to method return value

You can use a method return value for an output binding, by applying the attribute to the method return value. For examples, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings).

Use the return value only if a successful function execution always results in a return value to pass to the output binding. Otherwise, use `ICollector`

or `IAsyncCollector`

, as shown in the following section.

## Writing multiple output values

To write multiple values to an output binding, or if a successful function invocation might not result in anything to pass to the output binding, use the [ ICollector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs) or

[types. These types are write-only collections that are written to the output binding when the method completes.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)

`IAsyncCollector`

This example writes multiple queue messages into the same queue using `ICollector`

:

```
public static class ICollectorExample
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessageICollector")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-3")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] ICollector<string> myDestinationQueue,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 1: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 2: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


## Async

To make a function [asynchronous](/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/), use the `async`

keyword and return a `Task`

object.

```
public static class AsyncExample
{
[FunctionName("BlobCopy")]
public static async Task RunAsync(
[BlobTrigger("sample-images/{blobName}")] Stream blobInput,
[Blob("sample-images-copies/{blobName}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream blobOutput,
CancellationToken token,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"BlobCopy function processed.");
await blobInput.CopyToAsync(blobOutput, 4096, token);
}
}
```


You can't use `out`

parameters in async functions. For output bindings, use the [function return value](#binding-to-method-return-value) or a [collector object](#writing-multiple-output-values) instead.

## Cancellation tokens

A function can accept a [CancellationToken](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) parameter, which enables the operating system to notify your code when the function is about to be terminated. You can use this notification to make sure the function doesn't terminate unexpectedly in a way that leaves data in an inconsistent state.

Consider the case when you have a function that processes messages in batches. The following Azure Service Bus-triggered function processes an array of [ServiceBusReceivedMessage](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusreceivedmessage) objects, which represents a batch of incoming messages to be processed by a specific function invocation:

```
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
using System.Threading;
namespace ServiceBusCancellationToken
{
public static class servicebus
{
[FunctionName("servicebus")]
public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("csharpguitar", Connection = "SB_CONN")]
ServiceBusReceivedMessage[] messages, CancellationToken cancellationToken, ILogger log)
{
try
{
foreach (var message in messages)
{
if (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
log.LogInformation("A cancellation token was received. Taking precautionary actions.");
//Take precautions like noting how far along you are with processing the batch
log.LogInformation("Precautionary activities --complete--.");
break;
}
else
{
//business logic as usual
log.LogInformation($"Message: {message} was processed.");
}
}
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
log.LogInformation($"Something unexpected happened: {ex.Message}");
}
}
}
}
```


## Logging

In your function code, you can write output to logs that appear as traces in Application Insights. The recommended way to write to the logs is to include a parameter of type [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger), which is typically named `log`

. Version 1.x of the Functions runtime used `TraceWriter`

, which also writes to Application Insights, but doesn't support structured logging. Don't use `Console.Write`

to write your logs, since this data isn't captured by Application Insights.

### ILogger

In your function definition, include an [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger) parameter, which supports [structured logging](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/312197/benefits-of-structured-logging-vs-basic-logging).

With an `ILogger`

object, you call `Log<level>`

[extension methods on ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggerextensions#methods) to create logs. The following code writes `Information`

logs with category `Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User.`

:

```
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger logger)
{
logger.LogInformation("Request for item with key={itemKey}.", id);
```


To learn more about how Functions implements `ILogger`

, see [Collecting telemetry data](functions-monitoring#collecting-telemetry-data). Categories prefixed with `Function`

assume you're using an `ILogger`

instance. If you choose to instead use an `ILogger<T>`

, the category name might instead be based on `T`

.

### Structured logging

The order of placeholders, not their names, determines which parameters are used in the log message. Suppose you have the following code:

```
string partitionKey = "partitionKey";
string rowKey = "rowKey";
logger.LogInformation("partitionKey={partitionKey}, rowKey={rowKey}", partitionKey, rowKey);
```


If you keep the same message string and reverse the order of the parameters, the resulting message text would have the values in the wrong places.

Placeholders are handled this way so that you can do structured logging. Application Insights stores the parameter name-value pairs and the message string. The result is that the message arguments become fields that you can query on.

If your logger method call looks like the previous example, you can query the field `customDimensions.prop__rowKey`

. The `prop__`

prefix is added to ensure there are no collisions between fields the runtime adds and fields your function code adds.

You can also query on the original message string by referencing the field `customDimensions.prop__{OriginalFormat}`

.

Here's a sample JSON representation of `customDimensions`

data:

```
{
"customDimensions": {
"prop__{OriginalFormat}":"C# Queue trigger function processed: {message}",
"Category":"Function",
"LogLevel":"Information",
"prop__message":"c9519cbf-b1e6-4b9b-bf24-cb7d10b1bb89"
}
}
```


### Log custom telemetry

There's a Functions-specific version of the Application Insights SDK that you can use to send custom telemetry data from your functions to Application Insights: [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights). Use the following command from the command prompt to install this package:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights --version <VERSION>
```


In this command, replace `<VERSION>`

with a version of this package that supports your installed version of [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/).

The following C# examples uses the [custom telemetry API](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics). The example is for a .NET class library, but the Application Insights code is the same for C# script.

Version 2.x and later versions of the runtime use newer features in Application Insights to automatically correlate telemetry with the current operation. There's no need to manually set the operation `Id`

, `ParentId`

, or `Name`

fields.

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
using System.Linq;
namespace functionapp0915
{
public class HttpTrigger2
{
private readonly TelemetryClient telemetryClient;
/// Using dependency injection will guarantee that you use the same configuration for telemetry collected automatically and manually.
public HttpTrigger2(TelemetryConfiguration telemetryConfiguration)
{
this.telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(telemetryConfiguration);
}
[FunctionName("HttpTrigger2")]
public Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)]
HttpRequest req, ExecutionContext context, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
DateTime start = DateTime.UtcNow;
// Parse query parameter
string name = req.Query
.FirstOrDefault(q => string.Compare(q.Key, "name", true) == 0)
.Value;
// Write an event to the customEvents table.
var evt = new EventTelemetry("Function called");
evt.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackEvent(evt);
// Generate a custom metric, in this case let's use ContentLength.
this.telemetryClient.GetMetric("contentLength").TrackValue(req.ContentLength);
// Log a custom dependency in the dependencies table.
var dependency = new DependencyTelemetry
{
Name = "GET api/planets/1/",
Target = "swapi.co",
Data = "https://swapi.co/api/planets/1/",
Timestamp = start,
Duration = DateTime.UtcNow - start,
Success = true
};
dependency.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackDependency(dependency);
return Task.FromResult<IActionResult>(new OkResult());
}
}
}
```


In this example, the custom metric data gets aggregated by the host before being sent to the customMetrics table. To learn more, see the [GetMetric](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#getmetric) documentation in Application Insights.

When running locally, you must add the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`

setting, with the Application Insights key, to the [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file.

Don't call `TrackRequest`

or `StartOperation<RequestTelemetry>`

because you see duplicate requests for a function invocation. The Functions runtime automatically tracks requests.

Don't set `telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id`

. This global setting causes incorrect correlation when many functions are running simultaneously. Instead, create a new telemetry instance (`DependencyTelemetry`

, `EventTelemetry`

) and modify its `Context`

property. Then pass in the telemetry instance to the corresponding `Track`

method on `TelemetryClient`

(`TrackDependency()`

, `TrackEvent()`

, `TrackMetric()`

). This method ensures that the telemetry has the correct correlation details for the current function invocation.

## Testing functions

The following articles show how to run an in-process C# class library function locally for testing purposes:

## Environment variables

To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`

, as shown in the following code example:

```
public static class EnvironmentVariablesExample
{
[FunctionName("GetEnvironmentVariables")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));
}
private static string GetEnvironmentVariable(string name)
{
return name + ": " +
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
}
}
```


App settings can be read from environment variables both when developing locally and when running in Azure. When developing locally, app settings come from the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. In both environments, local and Azure, `GetEnvironmentVariable("<app setting name>")`

retrieves the value of the named app setting. For instance, when you're running locally, "My Site Name" would be returned if your *local.settings.json* file contains `{ "Values": { "WEBSITE_SITE_NAME": "My Site Name" } }`

.

The [System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings) property is an alternative API for getting app setting values, but we recommend that you use `GetEnvironmentVariable`

as shown here.

## Binding at runtime

In C# and other .NET languages, you can use an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) binding pattern, as opposed to the [ declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) bindings in attributes. Imperative binding is useful when binding parameters need to be computed at runtime rather than design time. With this pattern, you can bind to supported input and output bindings on-the-fly in your function code.

Define an imperative binding as follows:

**Do not**include an attribute in the function signature for your desired imperative bindings.Pass in an input parameter

or`Binder binder`

.`IBinder binder`

Use the following C# pattern to perform the data binding.

`using (var output = await binder.BindAsync<T>(new BindingTypeAttribute(...))) { ... }`

`BindingTypeAttribute`

is the .NET attribute that defines your binding, and`T`

is an input or output type that's supported by that binding type.`T`

can't be an`out`

parameter type (such as`out JObject`

). For example, the Mobile Apps table output binding supports[six output types](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.MobileApps/MobileTableAttribute.cs#L17-L22), but you can only use[ICollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs)or[IAsyncCollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)with imperative binding.

### Single attribute example

The following example code creates a [Storage blob output binding](functions-bindings-storage-blob-output) with blob path that's defined at run time, then writes a string to the blob.

```
public static class IBinderExample
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobUsingBinder")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-4")] string myQueueItem,
IBinder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobUsingBinder function processed: {myQueueItem}");
using (var writer = binder.Bind<TextWriter>(new BlobAttribute(
$"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write)))
{
writer.Write("Hello World!");
};
}
}
```


[BlobAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage/Blobs/BlobAttribute.cs) defines the [Storage blob](functions-bindings-storage-blob) input or output binding, and [TextWriter](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.textwriter) is a supported output binding type.

### Multiple attributes example

The preceding example gets the app setting for the function app's main Storage account connection string (which is `AzureWebJobsStorage`

). You can specify a custom app setting to use for the Storage account by adding the [StorageAccountAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/StorageAccountAttribute.cs) and passing the attribute array into `BindAsync<T>()`

. Use a `Binder`

parameter, not `IBinder`

. For example:

```
public static class IBinderExampleMultipleAttributes
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount")]
public async static Task RunAsync(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-binder2")] string myQueueItem,
Binder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount function processed: {myQueueItem}");
var attributes = new Attribute[]
{
new BlobAttribute($"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write),
new StorageAccountAttribute("MyStorageAccount")
};
using (var writer = await binder.BindAsync<TextWriter>(attributes))
{
await writer.WriteAsync("Hello World!!");
}
}
}
```

# Azure Functions runtime versions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure Functions currently supports two versions of the runtime host. The following table details the currently supported runtime versions, their support level, and when they should be used:]

| Version | Support level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 4.x | GA | Check out Recommended runtime version for functions in all languages.
|
| 1.x | GA (
|

**Support will end for version 1.x on September 14, 2026.**We highly recommend you[migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4?pivots=programming-language-csharp), which supports .NET Framework 4.8, .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10 Preview.Important

As of December 13, 2022, function apps running on versions 2.x and 3.x of the Azure Functions runtime reached the end of extended support. For more information, see [Retired versions](#retired-versions).

This article details some of the differences between supported versions, how you can create each version, and how to change the version on which your functions run.

## Levels of support

There are two levels of support:

**Generally available (GA)**- Fully supported and approved for production use.**Preview**- Not yet supported, but expected to reach GA status in the future.

## Languages

All functions in a function app must share the same language. You choose the language of functions in your function app when you create the app. The language of your function app is maintained in the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_runtime) setting, and can't be changed when there are existing functions.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the [top of the article](#top).

The following table shows the .NET versions supported by Azure Functions.

The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your selected execution model.

Your function app code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#supported-versions). For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
|---|---|---|
| .NET 10 | GA |
|

[November 10, 2026](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle)1[November 10, 2026](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle)[.NET Framework Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework).1 .NET 9 previously had an expected end-of-support date of May 12, 2026. During the .NET 9 service window, the .NET team extended support for STS versions to 24 months, starting with .NET 9. For more information, see [the blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-sts-releases-supported-for-24-months/).

.NET 6 was previously supported by the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).

.NET 7 was previously supported by the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [May 14, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).

For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The following table shows the language versions supported for Java function apps:

| Supported version | Support level | Supported until |
|---|---|---|
Java 25 |
Preview | Pending* |
Java 21 |
GA | See

For information about the language versions of previously supported versions of the Functions runtime, see [Retired runtime versions](language-support-policy#language-support-related-resources).

## Run on a specific version

The version of the Functions runtime used by published apps in Azure is dictated by the [ FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION](functions-app-settings#functions_extension_version) application setting. In some cases and for certain languages, other settings can apply.

By default, function apps created in the Azure portal, by the Azure CLI, or from Visual Studio tools are set to version 4.x. You can modify this version if needed. You can only downgrade the runtime version to 1.x after you create your function app but before you add any functions. Updating to a later major version is allowed even with apps that have existing functions.

### Migrating existing function apps

When your app has existing functions, you must take precautions before moving to a later major runtime version. The following articles detail breaking changes between major versions, including language-specific breaking changes. They also provide you with step-by-step instructions for a successful migration of your existing function app.

### Changing the version of apps in Azure

The following major runtime version values are used:

| Value | Runtime target |
|---|---|
`~4` |
4.x |
`~1` |
1.x |

Important

Don't arbitrarily change this app setting, because other app setting changes and changes to your function code might be required. For existing function apps, follow the [migration instructions](#migrating-existing-function-apps).

### Pinning to a specific minor version

To resolve issues that your function app could have when running on the latest major version, you must temporarily pin your app to a specific minor version. Pinning gives you time to get your app running correctly on the latest major version. The way that you pin to a minor version differs between Windows and Linux. To learn more, see [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version).

Older minor versions are periodically removed from Functions. For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

## Minimum extension versions

There's technically not a correlation between binding extension versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for all trigger and binding extensions.

If you receive a warning about a package not meeting a minimum required version, you should update that NuGet package to the minimum version as you normally would. The minimum version requirements for extensions used in Functions v4.x can be found in [the linked configuration file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script/extensionrequirements.json).

For C# script, update the extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


There's technically not a correlation between extension bundle versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for extension bundles.

If you receive a warning about your extension bundle version not meeting a minimum required version, update your existing extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


To learn more about extension bundles, see [Extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Retired versions

Important

[Support will end for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) for full support.

These versions of the Functions runtime reached the end of extended support on December 13, 2022.

| Version | Current support level | Previous support level |
|---|---|---|
| 3.x | Out of support | GA |
| 2.x | Out of support | GA |

As soon as possible, you should migrate your apps to version 4.x to obtain full support. For a complete set of language-specific migration instructions, see [Migrate apps to Azure Functions version 4.x](migrate-version-3-version-4).

Apps using versions 2.x and 3.x can still be created and deployed from your CI/CD DevOps pipeline, and all existing apps continue to run without breaking changes. However, your apps aren't eligible for new features, security patches, and performance optimizations. You can only get related service support after you upgrade your apps to version 4.x.

Versions 2.x and 3.x are no longer supported due to the end of support for .NET Core 3.1, which was a core dependency. This requirement affects all [languages supported by Azure Functions](supported-languages).

## Locally developed application versions

You can make the following updates to function apps to locally change the targeted versions.

### Visual Studio runtime versions

In Visual Studio, you select the runtime version when you create a project. Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio supports the two major runtime versions. The correct version is used when debugging and publishing based on project settings. The version settings are defined in the *.csproj* file in the following properties:

```
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```


If you're using the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), you can choose, `net9.0`

, `net8.0`

, or `net48`

as the target framework. You can also choose to use [preview support](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#preview-net-versions) for `net10.0`

. If you're using the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), you can choose `net8.0`

or `net6.0`

, and you must include the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

extension set to at least `4.4.0`

. .NET 10 is not supported by the in-process model; if you are on the in-process model and wish to use .NET 10, [migrate your app to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

.NET 6 was previously supported on the isolated worker model and the in-process model, but it reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).
.NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [May 14, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).

### Visual Studio Code and Azure Functions Core Tools

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local) is used for command-line development and also by the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Install the Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

For Visual Studio Code development, you might also need to update the user setting for the `azureFunctions.projectRuntime`

to match the version of the tools installed. This setting also updates the templates and languages used during function app creation.

## Bindings

Starting with version 2.x, the runtime uses a new [binding extensibility model](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/wiki/Binding-Extensions-Overview) that offers these advantages:

Support for non-Microsoft binding extensions.

Decoupling of runtime and bindings. This change allows binding extensions to be versioned and released independently. You can, for example, opt to upgrade to a version of an extension that relies on a newer version of an underlying SDK.

A lighter execution environment, where only the bindings in use are known and loaded by the runtime.


Except for HTTP and timer triggers, all bindings must be explicitly added to the function app project, or registered in the portal. For more information, see [Azure Functions binding expression patterns](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns).

This table shows the bindings that are supported in the major versions of the Azure Functions runtime:

| Type | 4.x1 |
1.x2 |
Trigger | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|

[Azure Cosmos DB](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2)[Azure Data Explorer](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer)[Azure SQL](functions-bindings-azure-sql)[Dapr](functions-bindings-dapr)4[Event Grid](functions-bindings-event-grid)[Event Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs)[HTTP and webhooks](functions-bindings-http-webhook)[IoT Hub](functions-bindings-event-iot)[Kafka](functions-bindings-kafka)3[Mobile Apps](functions-bindings-mobile-apps)[Model Context Protocol](functions-bindings-mcp)[Notification Hubs](functions-bindings-notification-hubs)[Queue Storage](functions-bindings-storage-queue)[Redis](functions-bindings-cache)[RabbitMQ](functions-bindings-rabbitmq)3[SendGrid](functions-bindings-sendgrid)[Service Bus](functions-bindings-service-bus)[Azure SignalR Service](functions-bindings-signalr-service)[Table Storage](functions-bindings-storage-table)[Timer](functions-bindings-timer)[Twilio](functions-bindings-twilio)- Register all bindings except HTTP and timer. See
[Register Azure Functions binding extensions](functions-bindings-register). This step isn't required when using version 1.x of the Functions runtime. [Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1).[Migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4)for full support.- Triggers aren't supported in the Consumption plan. This binding type requires
[runtime-driven triggers](functions-networking-options#elastic-premium-plan-with-virtual-network-triggers). - This binding type is supported in Kubernetes, Azure IoT Edge, and other self-hosted modes only.

## Function app timeout duration

The `functionTimeout`

property in the [host.json](functions-host-json#functiontimeout) project file sets the timeout duration for functions in a function app. This property applies specifically to function executions. After the trigger starts function execution, the function needs to return or respond within the timeout duration. When an execution exceeds this duration, a timeout error occurs and the language worker process restarts. For C# apps running in-process, the host process itself restarts. To avoid timeouts and subsequent process restarts, it's important to [write robust functions](functions-best-practices#write-robust-functions). For more information, see [Improve Azure Functions performance and reliability](performance-reliability#make-sure-background-tasks-complete).

The following table shows the default and maximum values (in minutes) for specific plans:

| Plan | Default | Maximum1 |
|---|---|---|
|
30 | Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded3 |
|
30 | Unbounded5 |
|
5 | 10 |

- Regardless of the function app timeout setting, 230 seconds is the maximum amount of time that an HTTP triggered function can take to respond to a request. This limit exists because of the
[default idle timeout of Azure Load Balancer](../app-service/faq-availability-performance-application-issues#why-does-my-request-time-out-after-230-seconds). For longer processing times, consider using the[Durable Functions async pattern](durable/durable-functions-overview#async-http)or[defer the actual work and return an immediate response](performance-reliability#avoid-long-running-functions). - There's no maximum execution timeout duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes
[during scale in](event-driven-scaling#scale-in-behaviors)for the Flex Consumption and Premium plans, and a grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - Requires the App Service plan be set to
[Always On](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - The default timeout for version 1.x of the Functions host runtime is
*unbounded*. - When the
[minimum number of replicas](../container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition)is set to zero, the default timeout depends on the specific triggers used in the app.

These values assume that the Azure Functions host process starts and runs correctly. There's a maximum timeout of 60 seconds for the language-specific worker process to also start. The worker process startup timeout isn't currently configurable.

# Troubleshoot error: "Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable"

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article helps you troubleshoot the following error string that appears in the Azure portal:

"Error: Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable. Click here for details on storage configuration."


This issue occurs when the Functions runtime can't start. The most common reason for this is that the function app lost access to its storage account. For more information, see [Storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).

The rest of this article helps you troubleshoot specific causes of this error, including how to identify and resolve each case.

## Storage account was deleted

Every function app requires a storage account that is used by the Functions host to operate. If that default host storage account is deleted, your function app won't run.

Start by looking up your storage account name in your application settings. Either `AzureWebJobsStorage`

or `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

contains the name of your storage account as part of a connection string. For more information, see [App settings reference for Azure Functions](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage).

Search for your storage account in the Azure portal to see whether it still exists. If it has been deleted, re-create the storage account and replace your storage connection strings. Your function code is lost, and you need to redeploy it.

## Storage account application settings were deleted

In the preceding step, if you can't find a storage account connection string, it was likely deleted or overwritten. Deleting application settings most commonly happens when you're using deployment slots or Azure Resource Manager scripts to set application settings.

### Required application settings

- Required:
- Required for Elastic Premium and Consumption plan functions:

For more information, see [App settings reference for Azure Functions](functions-app-settings).

### Guidance

- Don't check
**slot setting**for any of these settings. If you swap deployment slots, the function app breaks. - Don't modify these settings as part of automated deployments.
- These settings must be provided and valid at creation time. An automated deployment that doesn't contain these settings results in a function app that doesn't run, even if the settings are added later.

## Storage account credentials are invalid

The previously discussed storage account connection strings must be updated if you regenerate storage keys. For more information about storage key management, see [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create).

## Storage account is inaccessible

Your function app must be able to access the storage account. Common issues that block a function app's access to a storage account are:

The function app is deployed to your App Service Environment (ASE) without the correct network rules to allow traffic to and from the storage account.

The storage account firewall is enabled and not configured to allow traffic to and from functions. For more information, see

[Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security?toc=/azure/storage/files/toc.json).Verify that the

`allowSharedKeyAccess`

setting is set to`true`

, which is its default value. For more information, see[Prevent Shared Key authorization for an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent?tabs=portal#verify-that-shared-key-access-is-not-allowed).

## Daily execution quota is full

If you have a daily execution quota configured, your function app is temporarily disabled, which causes many of the portal controls to become unavailable.

To verify the quota in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Platform Features** > **Function App Settings** in your function app. If you're over the **Daily Usage Quota** that you set, the following message is displayed:

"The Function App has reached daily usage quota and has been stopped until the next 24 hours time frame."


To resolve this issue, remove or increase the daily quota, and then restart your app. Otherwise, the execution of your app is blocked until the next day.

## App is behind a firewall

Your function app might be unreachable for either of the following reasons:

Your function app is hosted in an

[internally load balanced App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase)and it's configured to block inbound internet traffic.Your function app has

[inbound IP restrictions](functions-networking-options#inbound-networking-features)that are configured to block internet access.

The Azure portal makes calls directly to the running app to fetch the list of functions, and it makes HTTP calls to the Kudu endpoint. Platform-level settings under the **Platform Features** tab are still available.

To verify your ASE configuration:

- Go to the network security group (NSG) of the subnet where the ASE resides.
- Validate the inbound rules to allow traffic that's coming from the public IP of the computer where you're accessing the application.

You can also use the portal from a computer that's connected to the virtual network that's running your app or to a virtual machine that's running in your virtual network.

For more information about inbound rule configuration, see [Networking considerations for an App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/network-info#network-security-groups).

## Container errors on Linux

For function apps that run on Linux in a container, the `Azure Functions runtime is unreachable`

error can occur as a result of problems with the container. Use the following procedure to review the container logs for errors:

Navigate to the Kudu endpoint for the function app, which is located at

`https://<FUNCTION_APP>.scm.azurewebsites.net`

, where`<FUNCTION_APP>`

is the name of your app.Download the Docker logs .zip file and review the contents on your local computer.

Check for any logged errors that indicate that the container is unable to start successfully.


## Container image unavailable

Errors can occur when the container image being referenced is unavailable or fails to start correctly. Check for any logged errors that indicate that the container is unable to start successfully.

You need to correct any errors that prevent the container from starting for the function app run correctly.

When the container image can't be found, you see a `manifest unknown`

error in the Docker logs. In this case, you can use the Azure CLI commands documented at [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version?tabs=azurecli#manual-version-updates-on-linux) to change the container image being referenced. If you've deployed a [custom container image](functions-how-to-custom-container), you need to fix the image and redeploy the updated version to the referenced registry.

## App container has conflicting ports

Your function app might be in an unresponsive state due to conflicting port assignment upon startup. This situation can happen in the following cases:

- Your container has separate services running where one or more services are tying to bind to the same port as the function app.
- You added an Azure Hybrid Connection that shares the same port value as the function app.

By default, the container in which your function app runs uses port `:80`

. When other services in the same container are also trying to using port `:80`

, the function app can fail to start. If your logs show port conflicts, change the default ports.

## Host ID collision

Starting with version 3.x of the Functions runtime, [host ID collision](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations) are detected and logged as a warning. In version 4.x, an error is logged and the host is stopped. If the runtime can't start for your function app, [review the logs](analyze-telemetry-data). If there's a warning or an error about host ID collisions, follow the mitigation steps in [Host ID considerations](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations).

## Read-only app settings

Changing any *read-only* [App Service application settings](../app-service/reference-app-settings#app-environment) can put your function app into an unreachable state.

## ASP.NET authentication overrides

*Applies only to C# apps running in-process with the Functions host.*

Configuring ASP.NET authentication in a Functions startup class can override services that are required for the Azure portal to communicate with the host. This includes, but isn't limited to, any calls to `AddAuthentication()`

. If the host's authentication services are overridden and the portal can't communicate with the host, it considers the app unreachable. This issue might result in errors such as: `No authentication handler is registered for the scheme 'ArmToken'.`

# SignalR Service bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to authenticate and send real-time messages to clients connected to [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) by using SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions. Azure Functions runtime version 2.x and higher supports input and output bindings for SignalR Service.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Handle messages from SignalR Service |
|

[Input binding](functions-bindings-signalr-service-input)[Output binding](functions-bindings-signalr-service-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.SignalRService/).

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Add dependency

To use the SignalR Service annotations in Java functions, you need to add a dependency to the *azure-functions-java-library-signalr* artifact (version 1.0 or higher) to your *pom.xml* file.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.microsoft.azure.functions</groupId>
<artifactId>azure-functions-java-library-signalr</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


## Connections

You can use [connection string](#connection-string) or [Microsoft Entra identity](#identity-based-connections) to connect to Azure SignalR Service.

### Connection string

For instructions on how to retrieve the connection string for your Azure SignalR Service, see [Connection strings in Azure SignalR Service](../azure-signalr/concept-connection-string#how-to-get-connection-strings)

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. You can customize the application setting name with the `connectionStringSetting`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using version 1.7.0 or higher, instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis).

First of all, you should make sure your Microsoft Entra identity has role [SignalR Service Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#signalr-service-owner).

Then you would define settings with a common prefix `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. You can customize prefix name with the `connectionStringSetting`

property of the binding configuration.

In this mode, the settings include following items:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `AzureSignalRConnectionString__serviceUri` |
The URI of your service endpoint. When you only configure "Service URI", the extensions would attempt to use
|

`AzureSignalRConnectionString__credential`

`managedidentity`

if your deployed Azure Function intends to use managed identity authentication. This value is only valid when a managed identity is available in the hosting environment.`AzureSignalRConnectionString__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a Resource ID and a client ID. If not specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`AzureSignalRConnectionString__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the resource Identifier to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to the resource ID of the user-defined managed identity. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.Note

When using `local.settings.json`

file at local, [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp), or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for identity-based connections, replace `__`

with `:`

in the setting name to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `AzureSignalRConnectionString:serviceUri`

.

#### Multiple endpoints setting

You can also configure multiple endpoints and specify identity settings per endpoint.

In this case, prefix your settings with `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}`

. The `{endpointName}`

is an arbitrary name assigned by you to associate a group of settings to a service endpoint. The prefix `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}`

can't be customized by `connectionStringSetting`

property.

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__serviceUri` |
The URI your service endpoint. When you only configure "Service URI", the extensions would attempt to use
|

`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__type`

`Primary`

. Valid values are `Primary`

and `Secondary`

, case-insensitive.`Secondary`

`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__credential`

`managedidentity`

if your deployed Azure Function intends to use managed identity authentication. This value is only valid when a managed identity is available in the hosting environment.`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a Resource ID and a client ID. If not specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the resource Identifier to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to the resource ID of the user-defined managed identity. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.For more information about multiple endpoints, see [Scale SignalR Service with multiple instances](../azure-signalr/signalr-howto-scale-multi-instances?pivots=serverless-mode#for-signalr-functions-extensions)

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Azure SignalR service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure SignalR Service resources with Microsoft Entra managed identities](../azure-signalr/signalr-howto-authorize-managed-identity#azure-signalr-service-bindings-in-azure-functions).

# Develop legacy C# class library functions using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This article is an introduction to developing Azure Functions by using C# in .NET class libraries. These class libraries are used to run *in-process with the Functions runtime*. Your .NET functions can alternatively run _isolated from the Functions *runtime*, which offers several advantages. To learn more, see [the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). For a comprehensive comparison between these two models, see [Differences between the in-process model and the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

Important

This article supports .NET class library functions that run in-process with the runtime. Your C# functions can also run out-of-process and isolated from the Functions runtime. The isolated worker process model is the only way to run non-LTS versions of .NET and .NET Framework apps in current versions of the Functions runtime. To learn more, see [.NET isolated worker process functions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).
For a comprehensive comparison between isolated worker process and in-process .NET Functions, see [Differences between in-process and isolate worker process .NET Azure Functions](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

As a C# developer, you might also be interested in one of the following articles:

| Getting started | Concepts | Guided learning/samples |
|---|---|---|

Azure Functions supports C# and C# script programming languages. If you're looking for guidance on [using C# in the Azure portal](functions-create-function-app-portal), see [C# script (.csx) developer reference](functions-reference-csharp).

## Supported versions

Versions of the Functions runtime support specific versions of .NET. To learn more about Functions versions, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions). Version support also depends on whether your functions run in-process or isolated worker process.

Note

To learn how to change the Functions runtime version used by your function app, see [view and update the current runtime version](set-runtime-version#view-the-current-runtime-version).

The following table shows the highest level of .NET or .NET Framework that can be used with a specific version of Functions.

| Functions runtime version |
|
|---|

[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library)

4

15.NET 9.0

.NET 8.0

.NET Framework 4.8

231 .NET 6 was previously supported on both models but reached the [end of official support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) on November 12, 2024. .NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the [end of official support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) on May 14, 2024.

2 The build process also requires the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

3 Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

4 Support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

5 You can't run .NET 10 apps on Linux in the Consumption plan. To run on Linux, you should instead use the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). For step-by-step migration instructions, see [Migrate Consumption plan apps to the Flex Consumption plan](migration/migrate-plan-consumption-to-flex?pivots=platform-linux).

For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

### Updating to target .NET 8

Apps using the in-process model can target .NET 8 by following the steps outlined in this section. However, if you choose to exercise this option, you should still begin planning your [migration to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) in advance of [support ending for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model).

Many apps can change the configuration of the function app in Azure without updates to code or redeployment. To run .NET 8 with the in-process model, three configurations are required:

- The
[application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings)`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

must be set with the value "dotnet". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION`

must be set with the value "~4". - The application setting
`FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

must be set with the value "1". - You must
[update the stack configuration](update-language-versions#update-the-stack-configuration)to reference .NET 8.

Support for .NET 8 still uses version 4.x of the Functions runtime, and no change to the configured runtime version is required.

To update your local project, first make sure you're using the latest versions of local tools. Then ensure that the project references [version 4.4.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.4.0). You can then change your `TargetFramework`

to "net8.0". You must also update `local.settings.json`

to include both `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

set to "dotnet" and `FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED`

set to "1".

The following example is a minimal `project`

file with these changes:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.4.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<None Update="host.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</None>
<None Update="local.settings.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
<CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


The following example is a minimal `local.settings.json`

file with these changes:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"FUNCTIONS_INPROC_NET8_ENABLED": "1",
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
}
}
```


If your app uses [ Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions), ensure it targets version 1.5.3 or later. Due to a behavior change in .NET 8, apps with older versions of the package throw an ambiguous constructor exception.

You might need to make other changes to your app based on the version support of its other dependencies.

Version 4.x of the Functions runtime provides equivalent functionality for .NET 6 and .NET 8. The in-process model doesn't include other features or updates that integrate with new .NET 8 capabilities. For example, the runtime doesn't support keyed services. To take full advantage of the latest .NET 8 capabilities and enhancements, you must [migrate to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

## Functions class library project

In Visual Studio, the **Azure Functions** project template creates a C# class library project that contains the following files:

[host.json](functions-host-json)- stores configuration settings that affect all functions in the project when running locally or in Azure.[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)- stores app settings and connection strings that are used when running locally. This file contains secrets and isn't published to your function app in Azure. Instead,[add app settings to your function app](functions-develop-vs#function-app-settings).

When you build the project, a folder structure that looks like the following example is generated in the build output directory:

```
<framework.version>
| - bin
| - MyFirstFunction
| | - function.json
| - MySecondFunction
| | - function.json
| - host.json
```


This directory is what gets deployed to your function app in Azure. The binding extensions required in [version 2.x](functions-versions) of the Functions runtime are [added to the project as NuGet packages](functions-develop-vs?tabs=in-process#add-bindings).

Important

The build process creates a *function.json* file for each function. This *function.json* file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file. To learn how to disable a function, see [How to disable functions](disable-function).

## Methods recognized as functions

In a class library, a function is a method with a `FunctionName`

and a trigger attribute, as shown in the following example:

```
public static class SimpleExample
{
[FunctionName("QueueTrigger")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items")] string myQueueItem,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


The `FunctionName`

attribute marks the method as a function entry point. The name must be unique within a project, start with a letter and only contain letters, numbers, `_`

, and `-`

, up to 127 characters in length. Project templates often create a method named `Run`

, but the method name can be any valid C# method name. The preceding example shows a static method being used, but functions aren't required to be static.

The trigger attribute specifies the trigger type and binds input data to a method parameter. The example function is triggered by a queue message, and the queue message is passed to the method in the `myQueueItem`

parameter.

## Method signature parameters

The method signature might contain parameters other than the one used with the trigger attribute. Here are some of the other parameters that you can include:

[Input and output bindings](functions-triggers-bindings)marked as such by decorating them with attributes.- An
`ILogger`

or`TraceWriter`

([version 1.x-only](functions-versions#creating-1x-apps)) parameter for[logging](#logging). - A
`CancellationToken`

parameter for[graceful shutdown](#cancellation-tokens). [Binding expressions](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns)parameters to get trigger metadata.

The order of parameters in the function signature doesn't matter. For example, you can put trigger parameters before or after other bindings, and you can put the logger parameter before or after trigger or binding parameters.

### Output bindings

A function can have zero or multiple output bindings defined by using output parameters.

The following example modifies the preceding one by adding an output queue binding named `myQueueItemCopy`

. The function writes the contents of the message that triggers the function to a new message in a different queue.

```
public static class SimpleExampleWithOutput
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] out string myQueueItemCopy,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CopyQueueMessage function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myQueueItemCopy = myQueueItem;
}
}
```


Values assigned to output bindings are written when the function exits. You can use more than one output binding in a function by assigning values to multiple output parameters.

The binding reference articles ([Storage queues](functions-bindings-storage-queue), for example) explain which parameter types you can use with trigger, input, or output binding attributes.

### Binding expressions example

The following code gets the name of the queue to monitor from an app setting, and it gets the queue message creation time in the `insertionTime`

parameter.

```
public static class BindingExpressionsExample
{
[FunctionName("LogQueueMessage")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("%queueappsetting%")] string myQueueItem,
DateTimeOffset insertionTime,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"Message content: {myQueueItem}");
log.LogInformation($"Created at: {insertionTime}");
}
}
```


## Autogenerated function.json

The build process creates a *function.json* file in a function folder in the build folder. As noted earlier, this file isn't meant to be edited directly. You can't change binding configuration or disable the function by editing this file.

The purpose of this file is to provide information to the scale controller to use for [scaling decisions on the Consumption plan](event-driven-scaling). For this reason, the file only has trigger info, not input/output bindings.

The generated *function.json* file includes a `configurationSource`

property that tells the runtime to use .NET attributes for bindings, rather than *function.json* configuration. Here's an example:

```
{
"generatedBy": "Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions-1.0.0.0",
"configurationSource": "attributes",
"bindings": [
{
"type": "queueTrigger",
"queueName": "%input-queue-name%",
"name": "myQueueItem"
}
],
"disabled": false,
"scriptFile": "..\\bin\\FunctionApp1.dll",
"entryPoint": "FunctionApp1.QueueTrigger.Run"
}
```


## Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions

The *function.json* file generation is performed by the NuGet package [Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions).

The following example shows the relevant parts of the `.csproj`

files that have different target frameworks of the same `Sdk`

package:

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.5.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```


Important

Starting with version 4.0.6517 of the Core Tools, in-process model projects must reference [version 4.5.0 or later of Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions/4.5.0). If an earlier version is used, the

`func start`

command will error.Among the `Sdk`

package dependencies are triggers and bindings. A 1.x project refers to 1.x triggers and bindings because those triggers and bindings target the .NET Framework, while 4.x triggers and bindings target .NET Core.

The `Sdk`

package also depends on [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json), and indirectly on [WindowsAzure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage). These dependencies make sure that your project uses the versions of those packages that work with the Functions runtime version that the project targets. For example, `Newtonsoft.Json`

has version 11 for .NET Framework 4.6.1, but the Functions runtime that targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 is only compatible with `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1. So your function code in that project also has to use `Newtonsoft.Json`

9.0.1.

The source code for `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

is available in the GitHub repo [azure-functions-vs-build-sdk](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-vs-build-sdk).

## Local runtime version

Visual Studio uses the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) to run Functions projects on your local computer. The Core Tools is a command-line interface for the Functions runtime.

If you install the Core Tools using the Windows installer (MSI) package or by using npm, it doesn't affect the Core Tools version used by Visual Studio. For the Functions runtime version 1.x, Visual Studio stores Core Tools versions in *%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Azure.Functions.Cli* and uses the latest version stored there. For Functions 4.x, the Core Tools are included in the **Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools** extension. For Functions 1.x, you can see what version is being used in the console output when you run a Functions project:

```
[3/1/2018 9:59:53 AM] Starting Host (HostId=contoso2-1518597420, Version=2.0.11353.0, ProcessId=22020, Debug=False, Attempt=0, FunctionsExtensionVersion=)
```


## ReadyToRun

You can compile your function app as [ReadyToRun binaries](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). ReadyToRun is a form of ahead-of-time compilation that can improve startup performance to help reduce the impact of [cold-start](event-driven-scaling#cold-start) when running in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan).

ReadyToRun is available in .NET 6 and later versions and requires [version 4.0 of the Azure Functions runtime](functions-versions).

To compile your project as ReadyToRun, update your project file by adding the `<PublishReadyToRun>`

and `<RuntimeIdentifier>`

elements. The following example is the configuration for publishing to a Windows 32-bit function app.

```
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
<PublishReadyToRun>true</PublishReadyToRun>
<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x86</RuntimeIdentifier>
</PropertyGroup>
```


Important

Starting in .NET 6, support for Composite ReadyToRun compilation has been added. Check out [ReadyToRun Cross platform and architecture restrictions](/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run).

You can also build your app with ReadyToRun from the command line. For more information, see the `-p:PublishReadyToRun=true`

option in [ dotnet publish](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).

## Supported types for bindings

Each binding has its own supported types; for instance, a blob trigger attribute can be applied to a string parameter, a POCO parameter, a `CloudBlockBlob`

parameter, or any of several other supported types. The [binding reference article for blob bindings](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#usage) lists all supported parameter types. For more information, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) and the [binding reference docs for each binding type](functions-triggers-bindings#related-content).

Tip

If you plan to use the HTTP or WebHook bindings, plan to avoid port exhaustion that can be caused by improper instantiation of `HttpClient`

. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

## Binding to method return value

You can use a method return value for an output binding, by applying the attribute to the method return value. For examples, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings).

Use the return value only if a successful function execution always results in a return value to pass to the output binding. Otherwise, use `ICollector`

or `IAsyncCollector`

, as shown in the following section.

## Writing multiple output values

To write multiple values to an output binding, or if a successful function invocation might not result in anything to pass to the output binding, use the [ ICollector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs) or

[types. These types are write-only collections that are written to the output binding when the method completes.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)

`IAsyncCollector`

This example writes multiple queue messages into the same queue using `ICollector`

:

```
public static class ICollectorExample
{
[FunctionName("CopyQueueMessageICollector")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-3")] string myQueueItem,
[Queue("myqueue-items-destination")] ICollector<string> myDestinationQueue,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# function processed: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 1: {myQueueItem}");
myDestinationQueue.Add($"Copy 2: {myQueueItem}");
}
}
```


## Async

To make a function [asynchronous](/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/), use the `async`

keyword and return a `Task`

object.

```
public static class AsyncExample
{
[FunctionName("BlobCopy")]
public static async Task RunAsync(
[BlobTrigger("sample-images/{blobName}")] Stream blobInput,
[Blob("sample-images-copies/{blobName}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream blobOutput,
CancellationToken token,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"BlobCopy function processed.");
await blobInput.CopyToAsync(blobOutput, 4096, token);
}
}
```


You can't use `out`

parameters in async functions. For output bindings, use the [function return value](#binding-to-method-return-value) or a [collector object](#writing-multiple-output-values) instead.

## Cancellation tokens

A function can accept a [CancellationToken](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtoken) parameter, which enables the operating system to notify your code when the function is about to be terminated. You can use this notification to make sure the function doesn't terminate unexpectedly in a way that leaves data in an inconsistent state.

Consider the case when you have a function that processes messages in batches. The following Azure Service Bus-triggered function processes an array of [ServiceBusReceivedMessage](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusreceivedmessage) objects, which represents a batch of incoming messages to be processed by a specific function invocation:

```
using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
using System.Threading;
namespace ServiceBusCancellationToken
{
public static class servicebus
{
[FunctionName("servicebus")]
public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("csharpguitar", Connection = "SB_CONN")]
ServiceBusReceivedMessage[] messages, CancellationToken cancellationToken, ILogger log)
{
try
{
foreach (var message in messages)
{
if (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
log.LogInformation("A cancellation token was received. Taking precautionary actions.");
//Take precautions like noting how far along you are with processing the batch
log.LogInformation("Precautionary activities --complete--.");
break;
}
else
{
//business logic as usual
log.LogInformation($"Message: {message} was processed.");
}
}
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
log.LogInformation($"Something unexpected happened: {ex.Message}");
}
}
}
}
```


## Logging

In your function code, you can write output to logs that appear as traces in Application Insights. The recommended way to write to the logs is to include a parameter of type [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger), which is typically named `log`

. Version 1.x of the Functions runtime used `TraceWriter`

, which also writes to Application Insights, but doesn't support structured logging. Don't use `Console.Write`

to write your logs, since this data isn't captured by Application Insights.

### ILogger

In your function definition, include an [ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger) parameter, which supports [structured logging](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/312197/benefits-of-structured-logging-vs-basic-logging).

With an `ILogger`

object, you call `Log<level>`

[extension methods on ILogger](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.loggerextensions#methods) to create logs. The following code writes `Information`

logs with category `Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User.`

:

```
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger logger)
{
logger.LogInformation("Request for item with key={itemKey}.", id);
```


To learn more about how Functions implements `ILogger`

, see [Collecting telemetry data](functions-monitoring#collecting-telemetry-data). Categories prefixed with `Function`

assume you're using an `ILogger`

instance. If you choose to instead use an `ILogger<T>`

, the category name might instead be based on `T`

.

### Structured logging

The order of placeholders, not their names, determines which parameters are used in the log message. Suppose you have the following code:

```
string partitionKey = "partitionKey";
string rowKey = "rowKey";
logger.LogInformation("partitionKey={partitionKey}, rowKey={rowKey}", partitionKey, rowKey);
```


If you keep the same message string and reverse the order of the parameters, the resulting message text would have the values in the wrong places.

Placeholders are handled this way so that you can do structured logging. Application Insights stores the parameter name-value pairs and the message string. The result is that the message arguments become fields that you can query on.

If your logger method call looks like the previous example, you can query the field `customDimensions.prop__rowKey`

. The `prop__`

prefix is added to ensure there are no collisions between fields the runtime adds and fields your function code adds.

You can also query on the original message string by referencing the field `customDimensions.prop__{OriginalFormat}`

.

Here's a sample JSON representation of `customDimensions`

data:

```
{
"customDimensions": {
"prop__{OriginalFormat}":"C# Queue trigger function processed: {message}",
"Category":"Function",
"LogLevel":"Information",
"prop__message":"c9519cbf-b1e6-4b9b-bf24-cb7d10b1bb89"
}
}
```


### Log custom telemetry

There's a Functions-specific version of the Application Insights SDK that you can use to send custom telemetry data from your functions to Application Insights: [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights). Use the following command from the command prompt to install this package:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights --version <VERSION>
```


In this command, replace `<VERSION>`

with a version of this package that supports your installed version of [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/).

The following C# examples uses the [custom telemetry API](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics). The example is for a .NET class library, but the Application Insights code is the same for C# script.

Version 2.x and later versions of the runtime use newer features in Application Insights to automatically correlate telemetry with the current operation. There's no need to manually set the operation `Id`

, `ParentId`

, or `Name`

fields.

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
using System.Linq;
namespace functionapp0915
{
public class HttpTrigger2
{
private readonly TelemetryClient telemetryClient;
/// Using dependency injection will guarantee that you use the same configuration for telemetry collected automatically and manually.
public HttpTrigger2(TelemetryConfiguration telemetryConfiguration)
{
this.telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(telemetryConfiguration);
}
[FunctionName("HttpTrigger2")]
public Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)]
HttpRequest req, ExecutionContext context, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
DateTime start = DateTime.UtcNow;
// Parse query parameter
string name = req.Query
.FirstOrDefault(q => string.Compare(q.Key, "name", true) == 0)
.Value;
// Write an event to the customEvents table.
var evt = new EventTelemetry("Function called");
evt.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackEvent(evt);
// Generate a custom metric, in this case let's use ContentLength.
this.telemetryClient.GetMetric("contentLength").TrackValue(req.ContentLength);
// Log a custom dependency in the dependencies table.
var dependency = new DependencyTelemetry
{
Name = "GET api/planets/1/",
Target = "swapi.co",
Data = "https://swapi.co/api/planets/1/",
Timestamp = start,
Duration = DateTime.UtcNow - start,
Success = true
};
dependency.Context.User.Id = name;
this.telemetryClient.TrackDependency(dependency);
return Task.FromResult<IActionResult>(new OkResult());
}
}
}
```


In this example, the custom metric data gets aggregated by the host before being sent to the customMetrics table. To learn more, see the [GetMetric](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#getmetric) documentation in Application Insights.

When running locally, you must add the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`

setting, with the Application Insights key, to the [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file.

Don't call `TrackRequest`

or `StartOperation<RequestTelemetry>`

because you see duplicate requests for a function invocation. The Functions runtime automatically tracks requests.

Don't set `telemetryClient.Context.Operation.Id`

. This global setting causes incorrect correlation when many functions are running simultaneously. Instead, create a new telemetry instance (`DependencyTelemetry`

, `EventTelemetry`

) and modify its `Context`

property. Then pass in the telemetry instance to the corresponding `Track`

method on `TelemetryClient`

(`TrackDependency()`

, `TrackEvent()`

, `TrackMetric()`

). This method ensures that the telemetry has the correct correlation details for the current function invocation.

## Testing functions

The following articles show how to run an in-process C# class library function locally for testing purposes:

## Environment variables

To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`

, as shown in the following code example:

```
public static class EnvironmentVariablesExample
{
[FunctionName("GetEnvironmentVariables")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
log.LogInformation(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));
}
private static string GetEnvironmentVariable(string name)
{
return name + ": " +
System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
}
}
```


App settings can be read from environment variables both when developing locally and when running in Azure. When developing locally, app settings come from the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. In both environments, local and Azure, `GetEnvironmentVariable("<app setting name>")`

retrieves the value of the named app setting. For instance, when you're running locally, "My Site Name" would be returned if your *local.settings.json* file contains `{ "Values": { "WEBSITE_SITE_NAME": "My Site Name" } }`

.

The [System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings) property is an alternative API for getting app setting values, but we recommend that you use `GetEnvironmentVariable`

as shown here.

## Binding at runtime

In C# and other .NET languages, you can use an [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) binding pattern, as opposed to the [ declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) bindings in attributes. Imperative binding is useful when binding parameters need to be computed at runtime rather than design time. With this pattern, you can bind to supported input and output bindings on-the-fly in your function code.

Define an imperative binding as follows:

**Do not**include an attribute in the function signature for your desired imperative bindings.Pass in an input parameter

or`Binder binder`

.`IBinder binder`

Use the following C# pattern to perform the data binding.

`using (var output = await binder.BindAsync<T>(new BindingTypeAttribute(...))) { ... }`

`BindingTypeAttribute`

is the .NET attribute that defines your binding, and`T`

is an input or output type that's supported by that binding type.`T`

can't be an`out`

parameter type (such as`out JObject`

). For example, the Mobile Apps table output binding supports[six output types](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.MobileApps/MobileTableAttribute.cs#L17-L22), but you can only use[ICollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/ICollector.cs)or[IAsyncCollector<T>](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/IAsyncCollector.cs)with imperative binding.

### Single attribute example

The following example code creates a [Storage blob output binding](functions-bindings-storage-blob-output) with blob path that's defined at run time, then writes a string to the blob.

```
public static class IBinderExample
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobUsingBinder")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-4")] string myQueueItem,
IBinder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobUsingBinder function processed: {myQueueItem}");
using (var writer = binder.Bind<TextWriter>(new BlobAttribute(
$"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write)))
{
writer.Write("Hello World!");
};
}
}
```


[BlobAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage/Blobs/BlobAttribute.cs) defines the [Storage blob](functions-bindings-storage-blob) input or output binding, and [TextWriter](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.textwriter) is a supported output binding type.

### Multiple attributes example

The preceding example gets the app setting for the function app's main Storage account connection string (which is `AzureWebJobsStorage`

). You can specify a custom app setting to use for the Storage account by adding the [StorageAccountAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/StorageAccountAttribute.cs) and passing the attribute array into `BindAsync<T>()`

. Use a `Binder`

parameter, not `IBinder`

. For example:

```
public static class IBinderExampleMultipleAttributes
{
[FunctionName("CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount")]
public async static Task RunAsync(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items-source-binder2")] string myQueueItem,
Binder binder,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"CreateBlobInDifferentStorageAccount function processed: {myQueueItem}");
var attributes = new Attribute[]
{
new BlobAttribute($"samples-output/{myQueueItem}", FileAccess.Write),
new StorageAccountAttribute("MyStorageAccount")
};
using (var writer = await binder.BindAsync<TextWriter>(attributes))
{
await writer.WriteAsync("Hello World!!");
}
}
}
```

# Azure Functions runtime versions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure Functions currently supports two versions of the runtime host. The following table details the currently supported runtime versions, their support level, and when they should be used:]

| Version | Support level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 4.x | GA | Check out Recommended runtime version for functions in all languages.
|
| 1.x | GA (
|

**Support will end for version 1.x on September 14, 2026.**We highly recommend you[migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4?pivots=programming-language-csharp), which supports .NET Framework 4.8, .NET 8, .NET 9, and .NET 10 Preview.Important

As of December 13, 2022, function apps running on versions 2.x and 3.x of the Azure Functions runtime reached the end of extended support. For more information, see [Retired versions](#retired-versions).

This article details some of the differences between supported versions, how you can create each version, and how to change the version on which your functions run.

## Levels of support

There are two levels of support:

**Generally available (GA)**- Fully supported and approved for production use.**Preview**- Not yet supported, but expected to reach GA status in the future.

## Languages

All functions in a function app must share the same language. You choose the language of functions in your function app when you create the app. The language of your function app is maintained in the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_runtime) setting, and can't be changed when there are existing functions.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the [top of the article](#top).

The following table shows the .NET versions supported by Azure Functions.

The supported version of .NET depends on both your Functions runtime version and your selected execution model.

Your function app code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with [supported versions of .NET and .NET Framework](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#supported-versions). For more information, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

| Supported version | Support level | Expected end-of-support date |
|---|---|---|
| .NET 10 | GA |
|

[November 10, 2026](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle)1[November 10, 2026](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle)[.NET Framework Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework).1 .NET 9 previously had an expected end-of-support date of May 12, 2026. During the .NET 9 service window, the .NET team extended support for STS versions to 24 months, starting with .NET 9.

## Run on a specific version

The version of the Functions runtime used by published apps in Azure is dictated by the [ FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION](functions-app-settings#functions_extension_version) application setting. In some cases and for certain languages, other settings can apply.

By default, function apps created in the Azure portal, by the Azure CLI, or from Visual Studio tools are set to version 4.x. You can modify this version if needed. You can only downgrade the runtime version to 1.x after you create your function app but before you add any functions. Updating to a later major version is allowed even with apps that have existing functions.

### Migrating existing function apps

When your app has existing functions, you must take precautions before moving to a later major runtime version. The following articles detail breaking changes between major versions, including language-specific breaking changes. They also provide you with step-by-step instructions for a successful migration of your existing function app.

### Changing the version of apps in Azure

The following major runtime version values are used:

| Value | Runtime target |
|---|---|
`~4` |
4.x |
`~1` |
1.x |

Important

Don't arbitrarily change this app setting, because other app setting changes and changes to your function code might be required. For existing function apps, follow the [migration instructions](#migrating-existing-function-apps).

### Pinning to a specific minor version

To resolve issues that your function app could have when running on the latest major version, you must temporarily pin your app to a specific minor version. Pinning gives you time to get your app running correctly on the latest major version. The way that you pin to a minor version differs between Windows and Linux. To learn more, see [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version).

Older minor versions are periodically removed from Functions. For the latest news about Azure Functions releases, including the removal of specific older minor versions, monitor [Azure App Service announcements](https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues).

## Minimum extension versions

There's technically not a correlation between binding extension versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for all trigger and binding extensions.

If you receive a warning about a package not meeting a minimum required version, you should update that NuGet package to the minimum version as you normally would. The minimum version requirements for extensions used in Functions v4.x can be found in [the linked configuration file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script/extensionrequirements.json).

For C# script, update the extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


There's technically not a correlation between extension bundle versions and the Functions runtime version. However, starting with version 4.x the Functions runtime enforces a minimum version for extension bundles.

If you receive a warning about your extension bundle version not meeting a minimum required version, update your existing extension bundle reference in the *host.json* as follows:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


To learn more about extension bundles, see [Extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Retired versions

Important

[Support will end for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) for full support.

These versions of the Functions runtime reached the end of extended support on December 13, 2022.

| Version | Current support level | Previous support level |
|---|---|---|
| 3.x | Out of support | GA |
| 2.x | Out of support | GA |

As soon as possible, you should migrate your apps to version 4.x to obtain full support. For a complete set of language-specific migration instructions, see [Migrate apps to Azure Functions version 4.x](migrate-version-3-version-4).

Apps using versions 2.x and 3.x can still be created and deployed from your CI/CD DevOps pipeline, and all existing apps continue to run without breaking changes. However, your apps aren't eligible for new features, security patches, and performance optimizations. You can only get related service support after you upgrade your apps to version 4.x.

Versions 2.x and 3.x are no longer supported due to the end of support for .NET Core 3.1, which was a core dependency. This requirement affects all [languages supported by Azure Functions](supported-languages).

## Locally developed application versions

You can make the following updates to function apps to locally change the targeted versions.

### Visual Studio runtime versions

In Visual Studio, you select the runtime version when you create a project. Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio supports the two major runtime versions. The correct version is used when debugging and publishing based on project settings. The version settings are defined in the *.csproj* file in the following properties:

```
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
```


If you're using the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), you can choose, `net9.0`

, `net8.0`

, or `net48`

as the target framework. You can also choose to use [preview support](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#preview-net-versions) for `net10.0`

. If you're using the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), you can choose `net8.0`

or `net6.0`

, and you must include the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

extension set to at least `4.4.0`

. .NET 10 is not supported by the in-process model; if you are on the in-process model and wish to use .NET 10, [migrate your app to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

.NET 6 was previously supported on the isolated worker model and the in-process model, but it reached the end of official support on [November 12, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).
.NET 7 was previously supported on the isolated worker model but reached the end of official support on [May 14, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle).

### Visual Studio Code and Azure Functions Core Tools

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local) is used for command-line development and also by the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio Code. For more information, see [Install the Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

For Visual Studio Code development, you might also need to update the user setting for the `azureFunctions.projectRuntime`

to match the version of the tools installed. This setting also updates the templates and languages used during function app creation.

## Bindings

Starting with version 2.x, the runtime uses a new [binding extensibility model](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/wiki/Binding-Extensions-Overview) that offers these advantages:

Support for non-Microsoft binding extensions.

Decoupling of runtime and bindings. This change allows binding extensions to be versioned and released independently. You can, for example, opt to upgrade to a version of an extension that relies on a newer version of an underlying SDK.

A lighter execution environment, where only the bindings in use are known and loaded by the runtime.


Except for HTTP and timer triggers, all bindings must be explicitly added to the function app project, or registered in the portal. For more information, see [Azure Functions binding expression patterns](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns).

This table shows the bindings that are supported in the major versions of the Azure Functions runtime:

| Type | 4.x1 |
1.x2 |
Trigger | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|

[Azure Cosmos DB](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2)[Azure Data Explorer](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer)[Azure SQL](functions-bindings-azure-sql)[Dapr](functions-bindings-dapr)4[Event Grid](functions-bindings-event-grid)[Event Hubs](functions-bindings-event-hubs)[HTTP and webhooks](functions-bindings-http-webhook)[IoT Hub](functions-bindings-event-iot)[Kafka](functions-bindings-kafka)3[Mobile Apps](functions-bindings-mobile-apps)[Model Context Protocol](functions-bindings-mcp)[Notification Hubs](functions-bindings-notification-hubs)[Queue Storage](functions-bindings-storage-queue)[Redis](functions-bindings-cache)[RabbitMQ](functions-bindings-rabbitmq)3[SendGrid](functions-bindings-sendgrid)[Service Bus](functions-bindings-service-bus)[Azure SignalR Service](functions-bindings-signalr-service)[Table Storage](functions-bindings-storage-table)[Timer](functions-bindings-timer)[Twilio](functions-bindings-twilio)- Register all bindings except HTTP and timer. See
[Register Azure Functions binding extensions](functions-bindings-register). This step isn't required when using version 1.x of the Functions runtime. [Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1).[Migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4)for full support.- Triggers aren't supported in the Consumption plan. This binding type requires
[runtime-driven triggers](functions-networking-options#elastic-premium-plan-with-virtual-network-triggers). - This binding type is supported in Kubernetes, Azure IoT Edge, and other self-hosted modes only.

## Function app timeout duration

The `functionTimeout`

property in the [host.json](functions-host-json#functiontimeout) project file sets the timeout duration for functions in a function app. This property applies specifically to function executions. After the trigger starts function execution, the function needs to return or respond within the timeout duration. When an execution exceeds this duration, a timeout error occurs and the language worker process restarts. For C# apps running in-process, the host process itself restarts. To avoid timeouts and subsequent process restarts, it's important to [write robust functions](functions-best-practices#write-robust-functions). For more information, see [Improve Azure Functions performance and reliability](performance-reliability#make-sure-background-tasks-complete).

The following table shows the default and maximum values (in minutes) for specific plans:

| Plan | Default | Maximum1 |
|---|---|---|
|
30 | Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded2 |
|
304 |
Unbounded3 |
|
30 | Unbounded5 |
|
5 | 10 |

- Regardless of the function app timeout setting, 230 seconds is the maximum amount of time that an HTTP triggered function can take to respond to a request. This limit exists because of the
[default idle timeout of Azure Load Balancer](../app-service/faq-availability-performance-application-issues#why-does-my-request-time-out-after-230-seconds). For longer processing times, consider using the[Durable Functions async pattern](durable/durable-functions-overview#async-http)or[defer the actual work and return an immediate response](performance-reliability#avoid-long-running-functions). - There's no maximum execution timeout duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes
[during scale in](event-driven-scaling#scale-in-behaviors)for the Flex Consumption and Premium plans, and a grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - Requires the App Service plan be set to
[Always On](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). A grace period of 10 minutes is given during platform updates. - The default timeout for version 1.x of the Functions host runtime is
*unbounded*. - When the
[minimum number of replicas](../container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition)is set to zero, the default timeout depends on the specific triggers used in the app.

These values assume that the Azure Functions host process starts and runs correctly. There's a maximum timeout of 60 seconds for the language-specific worker process to also start. The worker process startup timeout isn't currently configurable.

# Troubleshoot error: "Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable"

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article helps you troubleshoot the following error string that appears in the Azure portal:

"Error: Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable. Click here for details on storage configuration."


This issue occurs when the Functions runtime can't start. The most common reason for this is that the function app lost access to its storage account. For more information, see [Storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).

The rest of this article helps you troubleshoot specific causes of this error, including how to identify and resolve each case.

## Storage account was deleted

Every function app requires a storage account that is used by the Functions host to operate. If that default host storage account is deleted, your function app won't run.

Start by looking up your storage account name in your application settings. Either `AzureWebJobsStorage`

or `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

contains the name of your storage account as part of a connection string. For more information, see [App settings reference for Azure Functions](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage).

Search for your storage account in the Azure portal to see whether it still exists. If it has been deleted, re-create the storage account and replace your storage connection strings. Your function code is lost, and you need to redeploy it.

## Storage account application settings were deleted

In the preceding step, if you can't find a storage account connection string, it was likely deleted or overwritten. Deleting application settings most commonly happens when you're using deployment slots or Azure Resource Manager scripts to set application settings.

### Required application settings

- Required:
- Required for Elastic Premium and Consumption plan functions:

For more information, see [App settings reference for Azure Functions](functions-app-settings).

### Guidance

- Don't check
**slot setting**for any of these settings. If you swap deployment slots, the function app breaks. - Don't modify these settings as part of automated deployments.
- These settings must be provided and valid at creation time. An automated deployment that doesn't contain these settings results in a function app that doesn't run, even if the settings are added later.

## Storage account credentials are invalid

The previously discussed storage account connection strings must be updated if you regenerate storage keys. For more information about storage key management, see [Create an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create).

## Storage account is inaccessible

Your function app must be able to access the storage account. Common issues that block a function app's access to a storage account are:

The function app is deployed to your App Service Environment (ASE) without the correct network rules to allow traffic to and from the storage account.

The storage account firewall is enabled and not configured to allow traffic to and from functions. For more information, see

[Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks](../storage/common/storage-network-security?toc=/azure/storage/files/toc.json).Verify that the

`allowSharedKeyAccess`

setting is set to`true`

, which is its default value. For more information, see[Prevent Shared Key authorization for an Azure Storage account](../storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent?tabs=portal#verify-that-shared-key-access-is-not-allowed).

## Daily execution quota is full

If you have a daily execution quota configured, your function app is temporarily disabled, which causes many of the portal controls to become unavailable.

To verify the quota in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Platform Features** > **Function App Settings** in your function app. If you're over the **Daily Usage Quota** that you set, the following message is displayed:

"The Function App has reached daily usage quota and has been stopped until the next 24 hours time frame."


To resolve this issue, remove or increase the daily quota, and then restart your app. Otherwise, the execution of your app is blocked until the next day.

## App is behind a firewall

Your function app might be unreachable for either of the following reasons:

Your function app is hosted in an

[internally load balanced App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/create-ilb-ase)and it's configured to block inbound internet traffic.Your function app has

[inbound IP restrictions](functions-networking-options#inbound-networking-features)that are configured to block internet access.

The Azure portal makes calls directly to the running app to fetch the list of functions, and it makes HTTP calls to the Kudu endpoint. Platform-level settings under the **Platform Features** tab are still available.

To verify your ASE configuration:

- Go to the network security group (NSG) of the subnet where the ASE resides.
- Validate the inbound rules to allow traffic that's coming from the public IP of the computer where you're accessing the application.

You can also use the portal from a computer that's connected to the virtual network that's running your app or to a virtual machine that's running in your virtual network.

For more information about inbound rule configuration, see [Networking considerations for an App Service Environment](../app-service/environment/network-info#network-security-groups).

## Container errors on Linux

For function apps that run on Linux in a container, the `Azure Functions runtime is unreachable`

error can occur as a result of problems with the container. Use the following procedure to review the container logs for errors:

Navigate to the Kudu endpoint for the function app, which is located at

`https://<FUNCTION_APP>.scm.azurewebsites.net`

, where`<FUNCTION_APP>`

is the name of your app.Download the Docker logs .zip file and review the contents on your local computer.

Check for any logged errors that indicate that the container is unable to start successfully.


## Container image unavailable

Errors can occur when the container image being referenced is unavailable or fails to start correctly. Check for any logged errors that indicate that the container is unable to start successfully.

You need to correct any errors that prevent the container from starting for the function app run correctly.

When the container image can't be found, you see a `manifest unknown`

error in the Docker logs. In this case, you can use the Azure CLI commands documented at [How to target Azure Functions runtime versions](set-runtime-version?tabs=azurecli#manual-version-updates-on-linux) to change the container image being referenced. If you've deployed a [custom container image](functions-how-to-custom-container), you need to fix the image and redeploy the updated version to the referenced registry.

## App container has conflicting ports

Your function app might be in an unresponsive state due to conflicting port assignment upon startup. This situation can happen in the following cases:

- Your container has separate services running where one or more services are tying to bind to the same port as the function app.
- You added an Azure Hybrid Connection that shares the same port value as the function app.

By default, the container in which your function app runs uses port `:80`

. When other services in the same container are also trying to using port `:80`

, the function app can fail to start. If your logs show port conflicts, change the default ports.

## Host ID collision

Starting with version 3.x of the Functions runtime, [host ID collision](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations) are detected and logged as a warning. In version 4.x, an error is logged and the host is stopped. If the runtime can't start for your function app, [review the logs](analyze-telemetry-data). If there's a warning or an error about host ID collisions, follow the mitigation steps in [Host ID considerations](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations).

## Read-only app settings

Changing any *read-only* [App Service application settings](../app-service/reference-app-settings#app-environment) can put your function app into an unreachable state.

## ASP.NET authentication overrides

*Applies only to C# apps running in-process with the Functions host.*

Configuring ASP.NET authentication in a Functions startup class can override services that are required for the Azure portal to communicate with the host. This includes, but isn't limited to, any calls to `AddAuthentication()`

. If the host's authentication services are overridden and the portal can't communicate with the host, it considers the app unreachable. This issue might result in errors such as: `No authentication handler is registered for the scheme 'ArmToken'.`

# SignalR Service bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to authenticate and send real-time messages to clients connected to [Azure SignalR Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/signalr-service/) by using SignalR Service bindings in Azure Functions. Azure Functions runtime version 2.x and higher supports input and output bindings for SignalR Service.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Handle messages from SignalR Service |
|

[Input binding](functions-bindings-signalr-service-input)[Output binding](functions-bindings-signalr-service-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.SignalRService/).

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Add dependency

To use the SignalR Service annotations in Java functions, you need to add a dependency to the *azure-functions-java-library-signalr* artifact (version 1.0 or higher) to your *pom.xml* file.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.microsoft.azure.functions</groupId>
<artifactId>azure-functions-java-library-signalr</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


## Connections

You can use [connection string](#connection-string) or [Microsoft Entra identity](#identity-based-connections) to connect to Azure SignalR Service.

### Connection string

For instructions on how to retrieve the connection string for your Azure SignalR Service, see [Connection strings in Azure SignalR Service](../azure-signalr/concept-connection-string#how-to-get-connection-strings)

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. You can customize the application setting name with the `connectionStringSetting`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using version 1.7.0 or higher, instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis).

First of all, you should make sure your Microsoft Entra identity has role [SignalR Service Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#signalr-service-owner).

Then you would define settings with a common prefix `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. You can customize prefix name with the `connectionStringSetting`

property of the binding configuration.

In this mode, the settings include following items:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `AzureSignalRConnectionString__serviceUri` |
The URI of your service endpoint. When you only configure "Service URI", the extensions would attempt to use
|

`AzureSignalRConnectionString__credential`

`managedidentity`

if your deployed Azure Function intends to use managed identity authentication. This value is only valid when a managed identity is available in the hosting environment.`AzureSignalRConnectionString__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a Resource ID and a client ID. If not specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`AzureSignalRConnectionString__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the resource Identifier to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to the resource ID of the user-defined managed identity. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.Note

When using `local.settings.json`

file at local, [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp), or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for identity-based connections, replace `__`

with `:`

in the setting name to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `AzureSignalRConnectionString:serviceUri`

.

#### Multiple endpoints setting

You can also configure multiple endpoints and specify identity settings per endpoint.

In this case, prefix your settings with `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}`

. The `{endpointName}`

is an arbitrary name assigned by you to associate a group of settings to a service endpoint. The prefix `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}`

can't be customized by `connectionStringSetting`

property.

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__serviceUri` |
The URI your service endpoint. When you only configure "Service URI", the extensions would attempt to use
|

`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__type`

`Primary`

. Valid values are `Primary`

and `Secondary`

, case-insensitive.`Secondary`

`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__credential`

`managedidentity`

if your deployed Azure Function intends to use managed identity authentication. This value is only valid when a managed identity is available in the hosting environment.`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__clientId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the user-assigned identity to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a client ID corresponding to a user-assigned identity assigned to the application. It's invalid to specify both a Resource ID and a client ID. If not specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.`Azure__SignalR__Endpoints__{endpointName}__managedIdentityResourceId`

`credential`

is set to `managedidentity`

, this property can be set to specify the resource Identifier to be used when obtaining a token. The property accepts a resource identifier corresponding to the resource ID of the user-defined managed identity. It's invalid to specify both a resource ID and a client ID. If neither are specified, the system-assigned identity is used. This property is used differently in [local development scenarios](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections), when`credential`

shouldn't be set.For more information about multiple endpoints, see [Scale SignalR Service with multiple instances](../azure-signalr/signalr-howto-scale-multi-instances?pivots=serverless-mode#for-signalr-functions-extensions)

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Azure SignalR service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key.

# Code and test Azure Functions locally

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Whenever possible, you should create and validate your Azure Functions code project in a local development environment. Azure Functions Core Tools provides a local runtime version of Azure Functions that integrates with popular development tools for an integrated development, debugging, and deployments. Your local functions can even connect to live Azure services.

This article provides some shared guidance for local development, such as working with the [local.settings.json file](#local-settings-file). It also links to development environment-specific guidance.

Tip

You can find detailed information about how to develop functions locally in the linked IDE-specific guidance articles.

## Local development environments

The way in which you develop functions on your local computer depends on your [language](supported-languages) and tooling preferences. Make sure to choose your preferred language at the [top of the article](#top).

Tip

All local development relies on Azure Functions Core Tools to provide the Functions runtime for debugging in a local environment.

You can use these development environments to code functions locally in your preferred language:

| Environment | Description |
|---|---|

To learn more, see[Create a Python function in Azure from the command line](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-python).Each of these local development environments lets you create function app projects and use predefined function templates to create new functions. Each uses the Core Tools so that you can test and debug your functions against the real Functions runtime on your own machine just as you would any other app. You can also publish your function app project from any of these environments to Azure.

## Local project files

A Functions project directory contains the following files in the project root folder, regardless of language:

| File name | Description |
|---|---|
| host.json | To learn more, see the
|

[local settings file](#local-settings-file).[local settings file](#local-settings-file).Other files in the project depend on your language and specific functions. For more information, see the developer guide for your language.

### Local settings file

The `local.settings.json`

file stores app settings and settings used by local development tools. Settings in the `local.settings.json`

file are used only when you're running your project locally. When you publish your project to Azure, be sure to also add any required settings to the app settings for the function app.

Important

Because the `local.settings.json`

file might contain secrets, such as connection strings, you should use caution committing to source control. Tools that support Functions provide ways to synchronize settings in the `local.settings.json`

file with the [app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) in the function app to which your project is deployed.

The `local.settings.json`

file has this structure:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "<language worker>",
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "<connection-string>",
"MyBindingConnection": "<binding-connection-string>",
"AzureWebJobs.HttpExample.Disabled": "true"
},
"Host": {
"LocalHttpPort": 7071,
"CORS": "*",
"CORSCredentials": false
},
"ConnectionStrings": {
"SQLConnectionString": "<sqlclient-connection-string>"
}
}
```


These settings are supported when you run projects locally:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
`IsEncrypted` |
When this setting is set to `true` , all values are encrypted with a local machine key. Used with `func settings` commands. Default value is `false` . You might want to encrypt the local.settings.json file on your local computer when it contains secrets, such as service connection strings. The host automatically decrypts settings when it runs. Use the `func settings decrypt` command before trying to read locally encrypted settings. |
`Values` |
Collection of application settings used when a project is running locally. These key-value (string-string) pairs correspond to application settings in your function app in Azure, like
`AzureWebJobsStorage` |

`Connection`

for the [Blob storage trigger](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#configuration). For these properties, you need an application setting defined in the

`Values`

array. See the subsequent table for a list of commonly used settings. Values must be strings and not JSON objects or arrays. Setting names can't include a double underline (

`__`

) and shouldn't include a colon (`:`

). Double underline characters are reserved by the runtime, and the colon is reserved to support [dependency injection](functions-dotnet-dependency-injection#working-with-options-and-settings).

`Host`

`LocalHttpPort`

`func host start`

and `func run`

). The `--port`

command-line option takes precedence over this setting. For example, when running in Visual Studio IDE, you may change the port number by navigating to the "Project Properties -> Debug" window and explicitly specifying the port number in a `host start --port <your-port-number>`

command that can be supplied in the "Application Arguments" field.`CORS`

[cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). Origins are supplied as a comma-separated list with no spaces. The wildcard value (*) is supported, which allows requests from any origin.`CORSCredentials`

`true`

, allows `withCredentials`

requests.`ConnectionStrings`

`ConnectionStrings`

section of a configuration file, like [Entity Framework](/en-us/ef/ef6/). Connection strings in this object are added to the environment with the provider type of[System.Data.SqlClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient). Items in this collection aren't published to Azure with other app settings. You must explicitly add these values to the`Connection strings`

collection of your function app settings. If you're creating a [in your function code, you should store the connection string value with your other connections in](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection)`SqlConnection`

**Application Settings**in the portal.The following application settings can be included in the ** Values** array when running locally:

| Setting | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
`AzureWebJobsStorage` |
Storage account connection string, or`UseDevelopmentStorage=true` |
Contains the connection string for an Azure storage account. Required when using triggers other than HTTP. For more information, see the
`AzureWebJobsStorage` |

When you have the

[Azurite Emulator](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite)installed locally and you set

[to](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage)

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`

, Core Tools uses the emulator. For more information, see [Local storage emulator](#local-storage-emulator).

`AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled`

`true`

|`false`

`"AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled": "true"`

to the collection, where `<FUNCTION_NAME>`

is the name of the function. To learn more, see [How to disable functions in Azure Functions](disable-function#disable-functions-locally).`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

`dotnet`

`dotnet-isolated`

`node`

`java`

`powershell`

`python`

[reference.](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_runtime)`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION`

`~7`

`powerShellVersion`

site configuration setting, when it runs in Azure, which can be [set in the portal](functions-reference-powershell#changing-the-powershell-version).To learn how to use values from the `values`

array as environment variables in your function code, see [Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables) in the developer guide.

To learn how to use values from the `values`

array as environment variables in your function code, see [Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables) in the developer guide.

## Synchronize settings

When you develop your functions locally, any local settings required by your app must also be present in app settings of the function app to which your code is deployed. You might also need to download current settings from the function app to your local project. While you can [manually configure app settings in the Azure portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings), the following tools also let you synchronize app settings with local settings in your project:

## Triggers and bindings

When you develop your functions locally, you need to take trigger and binding behaviors into consideration. For HTTP triggers, you can call the HTTP endpoint on the local computer, using `http://localhost/`

. For non-HTTP triggered functions, there are several options to run locally:

- The easiest way to test bindings during local development is to use connection strings that target live Azure services. You can target live services by adding the appropriate connection string settings in the
`Values`

array in the local.settings.json file. When you do this, local executions during testing might affect your production services. Instead, consider setting-up separate services to use during development and testing, and then switch to different services during production. - For storage-based triggers, you can use a
[local storage emulator](#local-storage-emulator). - You can manually run non-HTTP trigger functions by using special administrator endpoints. For more information, see
[Manually run a non-HTTP-triggered function](functions-manually-run-non-http).

During local testing, you must be running the host provided by Core Tools (func.exe) locally. For more information, see [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local).

## HTTP test tools

During development, it's easy to call any of your function endpoints from a web browser when they support the HTTP GET method. However, for other HTTP methods that support payloads, such as POST or PUT, you need to use an HTTP test tool to create and send these HTTP requests to your function endpoints.

Caution

For scenarios where your requests must include sensitive data, make sure to use a tool that protects your data and reduces the risk of exposing any sensitive data to the public. Sensitive data you should protect might include: credentials, secrets, access tokens, API keys, geolocation data, even personal data.

You can keep your data secure by choosing an HTTP test tool that works either offline or locally, doesn't sync your data to the cloud, and doesn't require that you sign in to an online account. Some tools can also protect your data from accidental exposure by implementing specific security features.

Avoid using tools that centrally store your HTTP request history (including sensitive information), don't follow best security practices, or don't respect data privacy concerns.

Consider using one of these tools for securely sending HTTP requests to your function endpoints:

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)with an[extension from Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode), such as[REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)[PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod)[Microsoft Edge - Network Console tool](/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/network-console/network-console-tool)[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)[curl](https://curl.se/)

## Local storage emulator

During local development, you can use the local [Azurite emulator](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite) when testing functions with Azure Storage bindings (Queue Storage, Blob Storage, and Table Storage), without having to connect to remote storage services. Azurite integrates with Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, and you can also run it from the command prompt using npm. For more information, see [Use the Azurite emulator for local Azure Storage development](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite).

The following setting in the `Values`

collection of the local.settings.json file tells the local Functions host to use Azurite for the default `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection:

```
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true"
```


With this setting value, any Azure Storage trigger or binding that uses `AzureWebJobsStorage`

as its connection connects to Azurite when running locally. Keep these considerations in mind when using storage emulation during local execution:

- You must have Azurite installed and running.
- You should test with an actual storage connection to Azure services before publishing to Azure.
- When you publish your project, don't publish the
`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`

. In Azure, the`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting must always be the connection string of the storage account used by your function app. For more information, see.`AzureWebJobsStorage`

<artifactId>azure-functions-java-library-mysql</artifactId>
<version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```


## MySQL connection string

Azure Database for MySQL bindings for Azure Functions have a required property for the connection string. These bindings pass the connection string to the MySql.Data.MySqlClient library and provide support as defined in the [MySqlClient ConnectionString documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-connections-string.html). Notable keywords include:

`server`

: The host on which the server instance is running. The value can be a host name, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.`uid`

: The MySQL user account to provide for the authentication process.`pwd`

: The password to use for the authentication process.`database`

: The default database for the connection. If no database is specified, the connection has no default database.

## Considerations

- Azure Database for MySQL bindings support version 4.x and later of the Azure Functions runtime.
- You can find source code for the Azure Database for MySQL bindings in
[this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/src). - These bindings require connectivity to Azure Database for MySQL.
- Output bindings against tables with columns of spatial data types
`GEOMETRY`

,`POINT`

, and`POLYGON`

aren't supported. Data upserts fail.

## Samples

In addition to the samples for C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, and Python available in the [GitHub repository for Azure Database for MySQL bindings](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-mysql-extension/tree/main/samples), more are available in [Azure Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples).

|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-http-webhook-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http), version 3.x.

Note

An additional extension package is needed for [ASP.NET Core integration in .NET Isolated](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration)

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding in version 2.x and later. Settings in the host.json file apply to all functions in a function app instance. For more information about function app configuration settings, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

Note

For a reference of host.json in Functions 1.x, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions 1.x](functions-host-json-v1#http).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to send email by using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/index.html) bindings in Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports an output binding for SendGrid.

This is reference information for Azure Functions developers. If you're new to Azure Functions, start with the following resources:

C# developer references:

For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Example

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

We don't currently have an example for using the SendGrid binding in a function app running in an isolated worker process.

The following example shows a SendGrid output binding in a *function.json* file and a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that uses the binding.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "$return",
"type": "sendGrid",
"direction": "out",
"apiKey" : "MySendGridKey",
"to": "{ToEmail}",
"from": "{FromEmail}",
"subject": "SendGrid output bindings"
}
]
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

Here's the JavaScript code:

```
module.exports = function (context, input) {
var message = {
"personalizations": [ { "to": [ { "email": "sample@sample.com" } ] } ],
from: { email: "sender@contoso.com" },
subject: "Azure news",
content: [{
type: 'text/plain',
value: input
}]
};
return message;
};
```


Complete PowerShell examples aren't currently available for SendGrid bindings.

The following example shows an HTTP-triggered function that sends an email using the SendGrid binding. You can provide default values in the binding configuration. For instance, the *from* email address is configured in *function.json*.

```
{
"scriptFile": "__init__.py",
"bindings": [
{
"type": "httpTrigger",
"authLevel": "function",
"direction": "in",
"name": "req",
"methods": ["get", "post"]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "$return"
},
{
"type": "sendGrid",
"name": "sendGridMessage",
"direction": "out",
"apiKey": "SendGrid_API_Key",
"from": "sender@contoso.com"
}
]
}
```


The following function shows how you can provide custom values for optional properties.

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, sendGridMessage: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
value = "Sent from Azure Functions"
message = {
"personalizations": [ {
"to": [{
"email": "user@contoso.com"
}]}],
"subject": "Azure Functions email with SendGrid",
"content": [{
"type": "text/plain",
"value": value }]}
sendGridMessage.set(json.dumps(message))
return func.HttpResponse(f"Sent")
```


The following example uses the `@SendGridOutput`

annotation from the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime) to send an email using the SendGrid output binding.

```
package com.function;
import java.util.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
public class HttpTriggerSendGrid {
@FunctionName("HttpTriggerSendGrid")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@SendGridOutput(
name = "message",
dataType = "String",
apiKey = "SendGrid_API_Key",
to = "user@contoso.com",
from = "sender@contoso.com",
subject = "Azure Functions email with SendGrid",
text = "Sent from Azure Functions")
OutputBinding<String> message,
final ExecutionContext context) {
final String toAddress = "user@contoso.com";
final String value = "Sent from Azure Functions";
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder()
.append("{")
.append("\"personalizations\": [{ \"to\": [{ \"email\": \"%s\"}]}],")
.append("\"content\": [{\"type\": \"text/plain\", \"value\": \"%s\"}]")
.append("}");
final String body = String.format(builder.toString(), toAddress, value);
message.setValue(body);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Sent").build();
}
}
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the output binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file.

In [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) function apps, the `SendGridOutputAttribute`

supports the following parameters:

| Attribute/annotation property | Description |
|---|---|
ApiKey |
The name of an app setting that contains your API key. If not set, the default app setting name is `AzureWebJobsSendGridApiKey` . |
To |
(Optional) The recipient's email address. |
From |
(Optional) The sender's email address. |
Subject |
(Optional) The subject of the email. |
Text |
(Optional) The email content. |

## Annotations

The [SendGridOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.sendgridoutput) annotation allows you to declaratively configure the SendGrid binding by providing the following configuration values.

## Configuration

The following table lists the binding configuration properties available in the *function.json* file and the `SendGrid`

attribute/annotation.

function.json property |
Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `sendGrid` . |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . |
name |
The variable name used in function code for the request or request body. This value is `$return` when there's only one return value. |
apiKey |
The name of an app setting that contains your API key. If not set, the default app setting name is AzureWebJobsSendGridApiKey. |
to |
(Optional) The recipient's email address. |
from |
(Optional) The sender's email address. |
subject |
(Optional) The subject of the email. |
text |
(Optional) The email content. |

Optional properties may have default values defined in the binding and either added or overridden programmatically.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding in version 2.x and later. Settings in the host.json file apply to all functions in a function app instance. For more information about function app configuration settings, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

Note

For a reference of host.json in Functions 1.x, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions 1.x](functions-host-json-v1).

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"sendGrid": {
"from": "Azure Functions <samples@functions.com>"
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|

# Azure Queue storage trigger and bindings for Azure Functions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can run as new Azure Queue storage messages are created and can write queue messages within a function.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Run a function as queue storage data changes |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Storage.Queues](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues), version 5.x.

Using the .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues
```


Note

Azure Blobs, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables now use separate extensions and are referenced individually. For example, to use the triggers and bindings for all three services in your .NET isolated-process app, you should add the following packages to your project:

[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Blobs)[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues)[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables)

Previously, the extensions shipped together as [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage, version 4.x](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/4.0.4). This same package also has a [5.x version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage/5.0.0), which references the split packages for blobs and queues only. When upgrading your package references from older versions, you may therefore need to additionally reference the new [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Tables) NuGet package. Also, when referencing these newer split packages, make sure you are not referencing an older version of the combined storage package, as this will result in conflicts from two definitions of the same bindings.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Storage.Queues](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues) is in preview.

**Queue trigger**

The queue trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message content as a string. Use when the message is simple text.. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | When a queue message contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

[BinaryData](/en-us/dotnet/api/system.binarydata)11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues 5.2.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues/5.2.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Queue output binding**

When you want the function to write a single message, the queue output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message content as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the content of a JSON message. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the queue output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing content for multiple messages. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [QueueClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues.queueclient) with other types from [Azure.Storage.Queues](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.queues) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding in version 2.x and later. Settings in the host.json file apply to all functions in a function app instance. For more information about function app configuration settings, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

Note

For a reference of host.json in Functions 1.x, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions 1.x](functions-host-json-v1).

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"queues": {
"maxPollingInterval": "00:00:02",
"visibilityTimeout" : "00:00:30",
"batchSize": 16,
"maxDequeueCount": 5,
"newBatchThreshold": 8,
"messageEncoding": "base64"
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| maxPollingInterval | 00:01:00 | The maximum interval between queue polls. The minimum interval is 00:00:00.100 (100 ms). Intervals increment up to `maxPollingInterval` . The default value of `maxPollingInterval` is 00:01:00 (1 min). `maxPollingInterval` must not be less than 00:00:00.100 (100 ms). In Functions 2.x and later, the data type is a `TimeSpan` . In Functions 1.x, it is in milliseconds. |
| visibilityTimeout | 00:00:00 | The time interval between retries when processing of a message fails. |
| batchSize | 16 | The number of queue messages that the Functions runtime retrieves simultaneously and processes in parallel. When the number being processed gets down to the `newBatchThreshold` , the runtime gets another batch and starts processing those messages. So the maximum number of concurrent messages being processed per function is `batchSize` plus `newBatchThreshold` . This limit applies separately to each queue-triggered function. If you want to avoid parallel execution for messages received on one queue, you can set `batchSize` to 1. However, this setting eliminates concurrency as long as your function app runs only on a single virtual machine (VM). If the function app scales out to multiple VMs, each VM could run one instance of each queue-triggered function.The maximum `batchSize` is 32. |
| maxDequeueCount | 5 | The number of times to try processing a message before moving it to the poison queue. |
| newBatchThreshold | N*batchSize/2 | Whenever the number of messages being processed concurrently gets down to this number, the runtime retrieves another batch.`N` represents the number of vCPUs available when running on App Service or Premium Plans. Its value is `1` for the Consumption Plan. |
| messageEncoding | base64 | This setting is only available in
`base64` and `none` . |

# RabbitMQ trigger for Azure Functions overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the RabbitMQ trigger to respond to messages from a RabbitMQ queue.

Note

The RabbitMQ bindings are only fully supported on [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan) and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans. [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) and [Consumption](consumption-plan) plans aren't yet supported.

RabbitMQ bindings aren't supported by the Azure Functions v1.x runtime.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-rabbitmq).

## Example

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

```
[Function(nameof(RabbitMQFunction))]
[RabbitMQOutput(QueueName = "destinationQueue", ConnectionStringSetting = "RabbitMQConnection")]
public static string Run([RabbitMQTrigger("queue", ConnectionStringSetting = "RabbitMQConnection")] string item,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger(nameof(RabbitMQFunction));
logger.LogInformation(item);
var message = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return message;
}
```


The following Java function uses the `@RabbitMQTrigger`

annotation from the [Java RabbitMQ types](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.functions/azure-functions-java-library-rabbitmq) to describe the configuration for a RabbitMQ queue trigger. The function grabs the message placed on the queue and adds it to the logs.

```
@FunctionName("RabbitMQTriggerExample")
public void run(
@RabbitMQTrigger(connectionStringSetting = "rabbitMQConnectionAppSetting", queueName = "queue") String input,
final ExecutionContext context)
{
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request." + input);
}
```


The following example shows a RabbitMQ trigger binding in a *function.json* file and a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that uses the binding. The function reads and logs a RabbitMQ message.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "myQueueItem",
"type": "rabbitMQTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"queueName": "queue",
"connectionStringSetting": "rabbitMQConnectionAppSetting"
}
]
}
```


Here's the JavaScript script code:

```
module.exports = async function (context, myQueueItem) {
context.log('JavaScript RabbitMQ trigger function processed work item', myQueueItem);
};
```


The following example demonstrates how to read a RabbitMQ queue message via a trigger.

A RabbitMQ binding is defined in *function.json* where *type* is set to `RabbitMQTrigger`

.

```
{
"scriptFile": "__init__.py",
"bindings": [
{
"name": "myQueueItem",
"type": "rabbitMQTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"queueName": "queue",
"connectionStringSetting": "rabbitMQConnectionAppSetting"
}
]
}
```


```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
def main(myQueueItem) -> None:
logging.info('Python RabbitMQ trigger function processed a queue item: %s', myQueueItem)
```


PowerShell examples aren't currently available.

## Attributes

Both [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) and [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) C# libraries use `RabbitMQTriggerAttribute`

to define the function, where specific properties of the attribute depend on the extension version.

The attribute's constructor accepts these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
QueueName |
Name of the queue from which to receive messages. |
HostName |
This parameter is no longer supported and is ignored. It will be removed in a future version. |
ConnectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting that contains the connection string for your RabbitMQ server. This setting only takes an app setting key name, you can't directly set a connection string value. For more information, see
|

**UserNameSetting****PasswordSetting****Port**`5672`

.## Annotations

The `RabbitMQTrigger`

annotation allows you to create a function that runs when a RabbitMQ message is created.

The annotation supports the following configuration options:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
queueName |
Name of the queue from which to receive messages. |
connectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting that contains the connection string for your RabbitMQ server. This setting only takes an app setting key name, you can't directly set a connection string value. For more information, see
|

**disableCertificateValidation**`true`

indicating that certificate validation should be disabled. Default value is `false`

. Not recommended for production. Does not apply when SSL is disabled.## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `RabbitMQTrigger` . |
direction |
Must be set to `in` . |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the queue in function code. |
queueName |
Name of the queue from which to receive messages. |
connectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting that contains the connection string for your RabbitMQ server. This setting only takes an app setting key name, you can't directly set a connection string value. For more information, see
|

**disableCertificateValidation**`true`

indicating that certificate validation should be disabled. Default value is `false`

. Not recommended for production. Does not apply when SSL is disabled.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The parameter type supported by the RabbitMQ trigger depends on the C# modality used.

The RabbitMQ bindings currently support only string and serializable object types when running in an isolated process.

The queue message is available via `context.bindings.<NAME>`

where `<NAME>`

matches the name defined in function.json. If the payload is JSON, the value is deserialized into an object.

### Connections

Important

The RabbitMQ binding doesn't support Microsoft Entra authentication and managed identities. You can use Azure Key Vault to centrally managed your RabbitMQ connection strings. To learn more, see [Manage Connections](manage-connections).

Starting with version 2.x of the extension, `hostName`

, `userNameSetting`

, and `passwordSetting`

are no longer supported to define a connection to the RabbitMQ server. You must instead use `connectionStringSetting`

.

The `connectionStringSetting`

property can only accept the name of a key-value pair in app settings. You can't directly set a connection string value in the binding.

For example, when you have set `connectionStringSetting`

to `rabbitMQConnection`

in your binding definition, your function app must have an app setting named `rabbitMQConnection`

that returns either a connection value like `amqp://myuser:***@contoso.rabbitmq.example.com:5672`

or an [Azure Key Vault reference](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references).

When running locally, you must also have the key value for `connectionStringSetting`

defined in your *local.settings.json* file. Otherwise, your app can't connect to the service from your local computer and an error occurs.

### Dead letter queues

Dead letter queues and exchanges can't be controlled or configured from the RabbitMQ trigger. To use dead letter queues, pre-configure the queue used by the trigger in RabbitMQ. Refer to the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html).

### Enable Runtime Scaling

In order for the RabbitMQ trigger to scale out to multiple instances, the **Runtime Scale Monitoring** setting must be enabled.

In the portal, this setting can be found under **Configuration** > **Function runtime settings** for your function app.


In the Azure CLI, you can enable **Runtime Scale Monitoring** by using this command:

```
az resource update -resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> -name <APP_NAME>/config/web \
--set properties.functionsRuntimeScaleMonitoringEnabled=1 \
--resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites
```


### Monitoring a RabbitMQ endpoint

To monitor your queues and exchanges for a certain RabbitMQ endpoint:

- Enable the
[RabbitMQ management plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) - Browse to
`http://{node-hostname}:15672`

and log in with your user name and password.

# Create your first containerized Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you create a function app running in a Linux container and deploy it to Azure Functions.

Deploying your function code to Azure Functions in a container requires [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) or [Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan) hosting. Completing this article incurs costs of a few US dollars in your Azure account, which you can minimize by [cleaning-up resources](#clean-up-resources) when you're done.

Tip

When you need to run your event-driven functions in Azure in the same environment as other microservices, APIs, websites, workflows, or any container hosted programs, consider instead hosting your containerized function apps in Azure Container Apps. Functions provides integrated support for developing, deploying, and managing containerized function apps on Container Apps. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](../container-apps/functions-overview).

## Choose your development language

First, you use Azure Functions tools to create your project code as a function app in a Docker container using a language-specific Linux base image. Make sure to select your language of choice at the top of the article.

Core Tools automatically generates a Dockerfile for your project that uses the most up-to-date version of the correct base image for your functions language. You should regularly update your container from the latest base image and redeploy from the updated version of your container. For more information, see [Creating containerized function apps](functions-how-to-custom-container#creating-containerized-function-apps).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following requirements in place:

Install the

[.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).Install

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.0.5198, or a later version.

- Install
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.

- Install a version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-node#supported-versions).

- Install a version of Python that is
[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions).

- Install the
[.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Install a version of the

[Java Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-java#supported-versions).Install

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org)version 3.0 or above.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version 2.4 or a later version.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

To publish the containerized function app image you create to a container registry, you need a Docker ID and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) running on your local computer. If you don't have a Docker ID, you can [create a Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

You also need to complete the [Create a container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal#create-a-container-registry) section of the Container Registry quickstart to create a registry instance. Make a note of your fully qualified login server name.

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Make sure to use one of the [Python versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions) supported by Azure Functions.

```
python -m venv .venv
```


```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment.

## Create and test the local functions project

In a terminal or command prompt, run the following command for your chosen language to create a function app project in the current folder:

```
func init --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime powershell --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime python --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript --docker
```


In an empty folder, run the following command to generate the Functions project from a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=8 -Ddocker
```


The `-DjavaVersion`

parameter tells the Functions runtime which version of Java to use. Use `-DjavaVersion=11`

if you want your functions to run on Java 11. When you don't specify `-DjavaVersion`

, Maven defaults to Java 8. For more information, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions).

Important

The `JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the JDK to complete this article.

Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment. Follow the prompts and provide the following information:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
groupId |
`com.fabrikam` |
A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the
|

**artifactId**`fabrikam-functions`

**version**`1.0-SNAPSHOT`

**package**`com.fabrikam.functions`

Type `Y`

or press Enter to confirm.

Maven creates the project files in a new folder named *artifactId*, which in this example is `fabrikam-functions`

.

The `--docker`

option generates a *Dockerfile* for the project, which defines a suitable container for use with Azure Functions and the selected runtime.

Navigate into the project folder:

```
cd fabrikam-functions
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a C# code file in your project.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a configuration file named *function.json*.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


To test the function locally, start the local Azure Functions runtime host in the root of the project folder. To ensure the function can be called later when hosted in Docker, check that the authorization level is set to AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, or set it if not already configured.

```
func start
```


```
func start
```


```
npm install
npm start
```


```
mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```


After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to that endpoint. You should see a welcome message in the response output.

After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser must display a "hello" message that echoes back `Functions`

, the value supplied to the `name`

query parameter.

Press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop the host.

## Build the container image and verify locally

(Optional) Examine the *Dockerfile* in the root of the project folder. The *Dockerfile* describes the required environment to run the function app on Linux. The complete list of supported base images for Azure Functions can be found in the [Azure Functions base image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-base).

In the root project folder, run the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command, provide a name as `azurefunctionsimage`

, and tag as `v1.0.0`

. Replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker Hub account ID. This command builds the Docker image for the container.

```
docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .
```


When the command completes, you can run the new container locally.

To verify the build, run the image in a local container using the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command, replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

again with your Docker Hub account ID, and add the ports argument as `-p 8080:80`

:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -it <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```


After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample`

, which must display the same greeting message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

, which must display the same "hello" message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After verifying the function app in the container, press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop execution.

## Publish the container image to a registry

To make your container image available for deployment to a hosting environment, you must push it to a container registry. As a security best practice, you should use an Azure Container Registry instance and enforce managed identity-based connections. Docker Hub requires you to authenticate using shared secrets, which make your deployments more vulnerable.

Azure Container Registry is a private registry service for building, storing, and managing container images and related artifacts. You should use a private registry service for publishing your containers to Azure services.

Use this command to sign in to your registry instance using your current Azure credentials:

`az acr login --name <REGISTRY_NAME>`

In the previous command, replace

`<REGISTRY_NAME>`

with the name of your Container Registry instance.Use this command to tag your image with the fully qualified name of your registry login server:

`docker tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

Replace

`<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with the fully qualified name of your registry login server and`<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker ID.Use this command to push the container to your registry instance:

`docker push <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`


## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your container to Azure, you need to create three resources:

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A
[Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

Important

This article currently shows how to connect to both the Azure Storage account and your container registry by using connection strings and other shared secret credentials. For the best security, you should instead use only a managed identity-based connection to both your storage account and to Azure Container Registry using Microsoft Entra authentication. For more information, see the [Functions developer guide](functions-reference#connections).

Use the following commands to create these items. Both Azure CLI and PowerShell are supported. To create your Azure resources using Azure PowerShell, you also need the [Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps), version 5.9.0 or later.

If you haven't done already, sign in to Azure.

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account.`az login`

Create a resource group named

`AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`

in your chosen region.`az group create --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location <REGION>`

The

command creates a resource group. In the above command, replace`az group create`

`<REGION>`

with a region near you, using an available region code returned from the[az account list-locations](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations)command.Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region.

`az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location <REGION> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --sku Standard_LRS`

The

command creates the storage account.`az storage account create`

In the previous example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Storage names must contain 3 to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only.`Standard_LRS`

specifies a general-purpose account[supported by Functions](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).Use the command to create a Premium plan for Azure Functions named

`myPremiumPlan`

in the**Elastic Premium 1**pricing tier (`--sku EP1`

), in your`<REGION>`

, and in a Linux container (`--is-linux`

).`az functionapp plan create --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name myPremiumPlan --location <REGION> --number-of-workers 1 --sku EP1 --is-linux`

We use the Premium plan here, which can scale as needed. For more information about hosting, see

[Azure Functions hosting plans comparison](functions-scale). For more information on how to calculate costs, see the[Functions pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).The command also creates an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can monitor your function app and view logs. For more information, see

[Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring). The instance incurs no costs until you activate it.

## Create and configure a function app on Azure with the image

A function app on Azure manages the execution of your functions in your Azure Functions hosting plan. In this section, you use the Azure resources from the previous section to create a function app from an image in a container registry and configure it with a connection string to Azure Storage.

Create a function app using the following command, depending on your container registry:

`az functionapp create --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --plan myPremiumPlan --image <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 --registry-username <USERNAME> --registry-password <SECURE_PASSWORD>`

In this example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the name you used in the previous section for the storage account. Also, replace`<APP_NAME>`

with a globally unique name appropriate to you and`<DOCKER_ID>`

or`<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with your Docker Hub account ID or Container Registry server, respectively. When you're deploying from a custom container registry, the image name indicates the URL of the registry.When you first create the function app, it pulls the initial image from your Docker Hub. You can also

[Enable continuous deployment](functions-how-to-custom-container#enable-continuous-deployment-to-azure)to Azure from your container registry.Tip

You can use the

in the`DisableColor`

setting*host.json*file to prevent ANSI control characters from being written to the container logs.Use the following command to get the connection string for the storage account you created:

`az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <STORAGE_NAME> --query connectionString --output tsv`

The connection string for the storage account is returned by using the

command.`az storage account show-connection-string`

Important

This article currently shows how to connect to the default storage account by using a connection string. For the best security, you should instead create a managed identity-based connection to Azure Storage using Microsoft Entra authentication. For more information, see the

[Functions developer guide](functions-reference#connections).Replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the name of the storage account you created earlier.Use the following command to add the setting to the function app:

`az functionapp config appsettings set --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --settings AzureWebJobsStorage=<CONNECTION_STRING>`

The

command creates the setting.`az functionapp config appsettings set`

In this command, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app and`<CONNECTION_STRING>`

with the connection string from the previous step. The connection should be a long encoded string that begins with`DefaultEndpointProtocol=`

.The function can now use this connection string to access the storage account.


## Verify your functions on Azure

With the image deployed to your function app in Azure, you can now invoke the function through HTTP requests.

Run the following

command to get the URL of your new function:`az functionapp function show`

`az functionapp function show --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <APP_NAME> --function-name HttpExample --query invokeUrlTemplate`

Replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app.

- Use the URL you just obtained to call the
`HttpExample`

function endpoint, appending the query string`?name=Functions`

.

- Use the URL you just obtained to call the
`HttpExample`

function endpoint.

When you navigate to this URL, the browser must display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

## Clean up resources

If you want to continue working with Azure Function using the resources you created in this article, you can leave all those resources in place. Because you created a Premium Plan for Azure Functions, you'll incur one or two USD per day in ongoing costs.

To avoid ongoing costs, delete the `AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`

resource group to clean up all the resources in that group:

```
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg
```
