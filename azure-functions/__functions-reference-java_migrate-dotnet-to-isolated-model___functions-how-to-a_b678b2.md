Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This guide contains detailed information to help you succeed developing Azure Functions using Java.

As a Java developer, if you're new to Azure Functions, consider first reading one of the following articles:

| Getting started | Concepts | Scenarios/samples |
|---|---|---|

## Java function basics

A Java function is a `public`

method, decorated with the annotation `@FunctionName`

. This method defines the entry for a Java function, and must be unique in a particular package. The package can have multiple classes with multiple public methods annotated with `@FunctionName`

. A single package is deployed to a function app in Azure. In Azure, the function app provides the deployment, execution, and management context for your individual Java functions.

## Programming model

The concepts of [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) are fundamental to Azure Functions. Triggers start the execution of your code. Bindings give you a way to pass data to and return data from a function, without having to write custom data access code.

## Create Java functions

To make it easier to create Java functions, there are Maven-based tooling and archetypes that use predefined Java templates to help you create projects with a specific function trigger.

### Maven-based tooling

The following developer environments have Azure Functions tooling that lets you create Java function projects:

These articles show you how to create your first functions using your IDE of choice.

### Project scaffolding

If you prefer command line development from the Terminal, the simplest way to scaffold Java-based function projects is to use `Apache Maven`

archetypes. The Java Maven archetype for Azure Functions is published under the following *groupId*:*artifactId*: [com.microsoft.azure:azure-functions-archetype](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-functions-archetype/).

The following command generates a new Java function project using this archetype:

```
mvn archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype
```


To get started using this archetype, see the [Java quickstart](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-java).

## Folder structure

Here's the folder structure of an Azure Functions Java project:

```
FunctionsProject
| - src
| | - main
| | | - java
| | | | - FunctionApp
| | | | | - MyFirstFunction.java
| | | | | - MySecondFunction.java
| - target
| | - azure-functions
| | | - FunctionApp
| | | | - FunctionApp.jar
| | | | - host.json
| | | | - MyFirstFunction
| | | | | - function.json
| | | | - MySecondFunction
| | | | | - function.json
| | | | - bin
| | | | - lib
| - pom.xml
```


You can use a shared [host.json](functions-host-json) file to configure the function app. Each function has its own code file (.java) and binding configuration file (function.json).

You can have more than one function in a project. However, don't put your functions into separate jars. Using multiple jars in a single function app isn't supported. The `FunctionApp`

in the target directory is what gets deployed to your function app in Azure.

## Triggers and annotations

Functions are invoked by a trigger, such as an HTTP request, a timer, or an update to data. Your function needs to process that trigger, and any other inputs, to produce one or more outputs.

Use the Java annotations included in the [com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation) package to bind input and outputs to your methods. For more information, see the [Java reference docs](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation).

Important

You must configure an Azure Storage account in your [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) to run Azure Blob storage, Azure Queue storage, or Azure Table storage triggers locally.

Example:

```
public class Function {
public String echo(@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
String req, ExecutionContext context) {
return String.format(req);
}
}
```


Here's the generated corresponding `function.json`

by the [azure-functions-maven-plugin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure/azure-functions-maven-plugin):

```
{
"scriptFile": "azure-functions-example.jar",
"entryPoint": "com.example.Function.echo",
"bindings": [
{
"type": "httpTrigger",
"name": "req",
"direction": "in",
"authLevel": "anonymous",
"methods": [ "GET","POST" ]
},
{
"type": "http",
"name": "$return",
"direction": "out"
}
]
}
```


## Java versions

The version of Java on which your app runs in Azure is specified in the pom.xml file. The Maven archetype currently generates a pom.xml for Java 8, which you can change before publishing. The Java version in pom.xml should match the version of Java on which you develop and test your app locally.

### Supported versions

The following table shows current supported Java versions for each major version of the Functions runtime, by operating system:

| Functions version | Java versions (Windows) | Java versions (Linux) |
|---|---|---|
| 4.x | 21 17 11 8 |
21 17 11 8 |
| 3.x | 11 8 |
11 8 |
| 2.x | 8 | n/a |

Unless you specify a Java version for your deployment, the Maven archetype defaults to Java 8 during deployment to Azure.

### Specify the deployment version

You can control the version of Java targeted by the Maven archetype by using the `-DjavaVersion`

parameter. This parameter must match [supported Java versions](supported-languages?pivots=programming-language-java#languages-by-runtime-version).

The Maven archetype generates a pom.xml that targets the specified Java version. The following elements in pom.xml indicate the Java version to use:

| Element | Java 8 value | Java 11 value | Java 17 value | Java 21 value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`Java.version` |
1.8 | 11 | 17 | 21 | Version of Java used by the maven-compiler-plugin. |
`JavaVersion` |
8 | 11 | 17 | 21 | Java version hosted by the function app in Azure. |

The following examples show the settings for Java 8 in the relevant sections of the pom.xml file:

`Java.version`


```
<properties>
<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
<java.version>1.8</java.version>
<azure.functions.maven.plugin.version>1.6.0</azure.functions.maven.plugin.version>
<azure.functions.java.library.version>1.3.1</azure.functions.java.library.version>
<functionAppName>fabrikam-functions-20200718015742191</functionAppName>
<stagingDirectory>${project.build.directory}/azure-functions/${functionAppName}</stagingDirectory>
</properties>
```


`JavaVersion`


```
<runtime>
<!-- runtime os, could be windows, linux or docker-->
<os>windows</os>
<javaVersion>8</javaVersion>
<!-- for docker function, please set the following parameters -->
<!-- <image>[hub-user/]repo-name[:tag]</image> -->
<!-- <serverId></serverId> -->
<!-- <registryUrl></registryUrl> -->
</runtime>
```


Important

You must have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set correctly to the JDK directory that is used during code compiling using Maven. Make sure that the version of the JDK is at least as high as the `Java.version`

setting.

### Specify the deployment OS

Maven also lets you specify the operating system on which your function app runs in Azure. Use the `os`

element to choose the operating system.

| Element | Windows | Linux | Docker |
|---|---|---|---|
`os` |
`windows` |
`linux` |
`docker` |

The following example shows the operating system setting in the `runtime`

section of the pom.xml file:

```
<runtime>
<!-- runtime os, could be windows, linux or docker-->
<os>windows</os>
<javaVersion>8</javaVersion>
<!-- for docker function, please set the following parameters -->
<!-- <image>[hub-user/]repo-name[:tag]</image> -->
<!-- <serverId></serverId> -->
<!-- <registryUrl></registryUrl> -->
</runtime>
```


## JDK runtime availability and support

Microsoft and [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) builds of OpenJDK are provided and supported on Functions for Java 8 (Adoptium), Java 11, 17 and 21 (MSFT). These binaries are provided as a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of the OpenJDK for Azure. They contain all the components for building and running Java SE applications.

For local development or testing, you can download the [Microsoft build of OpenJDK](/en-us/java/openjdk/download) or [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) binaries for free. [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/) for issues with the JDKs and function apps is available with a [qualified support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/).

If you would like to continue using the Zulu for Azure binaries on your Function app, [configure your app accordingly](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker/wiki/Customize-JVM-to-use-Zulu). You can continue to use the Azul binaries for your site. However, any security patches or improvements are only available in new versions of the OpenJDK. Because of this, you should eventually remove this configuration so that your apps use the latest available version of Java.

## Customize JVM

Functions lets you customize the Java virtual machine (JVM) used to run your Java functions. The [following JVM options](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker/blob/master/worker.config.json#L7) are used by default:

`-XX:+TieredCompilation`

`-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1`

`-noverify`

`-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`

`-jar`


You can provide other arguments to the JVM by using one of the following application settings, depending on the plan type:

| Plan type | Setting name | Comment |
|---|---|---|
|

`languageWorkers__java__arguments`

[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)[Dedicated plan](dedicated-plan)`JAVA_OPTS`

The following sections show you how to add these settings. To learn more about working with application settings, see the [Work with application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) section.

### Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), use the [Application Settings tab](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) to add either the `languageWorkers__java__arguments`

or the `JAVA_OPTS`

setting.

### Azure CLI

You can use the [az functionapp config appsettings set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings) command to add these settings, as shown in the following example for the `-Djava.awt.headless=true`

option:

```
az functionapp config appsettings set \
--settings "languageWorkers__java__arguments=-Djava.awt.headless=true" \
--name <APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP>
```


This example enables headless mode. Replace `<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app, and `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

with the resource group.

## Third-party libraries

Azure Functions supports the use of third-party libraries. By default, all dependencies specified in your project `pom.xml`

file are automatically bundled during the [ mvn package](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/blob/master/azure-functions-maven-plugin/README.md#azure-functionspackage) goal. For libraries not specified as dependencies in the

`pom.xml`

file, place them in a `lib`

directory in the function's root directory. Dependencies placed in the `lib`

directory are added to the system class loader at runtime.The `com.microsoft.azure.functions:azure-functions-java-library`

dependency is provided on the classpath by default, and doesn't need to be included in the `lib`

directory. Also, [azure-functions-java-worker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker) adds dependencies listed [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker/wiki/Azure-Java-Functions-Worker-Dependencies) to the classpath.

## Data type support

You can use plain-old Java objects (POJOs), types defined in `azure-functions-java-library`

, or primitive data types such as `String`

and `Integer`

to bind to input or output bindings.

Note

Support for binding to SDK types is currently in preview and limited to the Azure Blob Storage SDK. For more information, see [SDK types](functions-reference-java#sdk-types) in the Java reference article.

### POJOs

For converting input data to POJO, [azure-functions-java-worker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker) uses the [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library. POJO types used as inputs to functions should be `public`

.

### Binary data

Bind binary inputs or outputs to `byte[]`

, by setting the `dataType`

field in your function.json to `binary`

:

```
@FunctionName("BlobTrigger")
@StorageAccount("AzureWebJobsStorage")
public void blobTrigger(
@BlobTrigger(name = "content", path = "myblob/{fileName}", dataType = "binary") byte[] content,
@BindingName("fileName") String fileName,
final ExecutionContext context
) {
context.getLogger().info("Java Blob trigger function processed a blob.\n Name: " + fileName + "\n Size: " + content.length + " Bytes");
}
```


If you expect null values, use `Optional<T>`

.

### SDK types (preview)

You can currently use these Blob Storage SDK types in your bindings: `BlobClient`

and `BlobContainerClient`

.

With SDK types support enabled, your functions can use Azure SDK client types to access blobs as streams directly from storage, which provides these benefits over POJOs or binary types:

- Lower latency
- Reduced memory requirements
- Removes request-based size limits (uses service defaults)
- Provides access to the full SDK surface: metadata, ACLs, legal holds, and other SDK-specific data.

#### Requirements

- Set the
app setting to`JAVA_ENABLE_SDK_TYPES`

`true`

to enable SDK types. `azure-functions-maven-plugin`

(or Gradle plug-in) version`1.38.0`

or a higher version.

#### Examples

Blob trigger that uses `BlobClient`

to access properties of the blob.

```
@FunctionName("processBlob")
public void run(
@BlobTrigger(
name = "content",
path = "images/{name}",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") BlobClient blob,
@BindingName("name") String file,
ExecutionContext ctx)
{
ctx.getLogger().info("Size = " + blob.getProperties().getBlobSize());
}
```


Blob trigger that uses `BlobContainerClient`

to access info about blobs in the container.

```
@FunctionName("containerOps")
public void run(
@BlobTrigger(
name = "content",
path = "images/{name}",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") BlobContainerClient container,
ExecutionContext ctx)
{
container.listBlobs()
.forEach(b -> ctx.getLogger().info(b.getName()));
}
```


Blob input binding that uses `BlobClient`

to get information about the blob that triggered the execution.

```
@FunctionName("checkAgainstInputBlob")
public void run(
@BlobInput(
name = "inputBlob",
path = "inputContainer/input.txt") BlobClient inputBlob,
@BlobTrigger(
name = "content",
path = "images/{name}",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage",
dataType = "string") String triggerBlob,
ExecutionContext ctx)
{
ctx.getLogger().info("Size = " + inputBlob.getProperties().getBlobSize());
}
```


#### Considerations

- The
`dataType`

setting on`@BlobTrigger`

is ignored when binding to an SDK type. - Currently, only one SDK type can be used at a time in a given function definition. When a function has both a Blog trigger or input binding and a Blob output binding, one binding can use an SDK type (such as
`BlobClient`

) and the others must use a native type or POJO. - You can use managed identities with SDK types.

#### Troubleshooting

These are potential errors that might occur when using SDK types:

| Exception | Meaning |
|---|---|
`SdkAnalysisException` |
Build plug-in couldn’t create metadata. This might be due to duplicate SDK-types in a single function definition, an unsupported parameter type, or some other misconfiguration. |
`SdkRegistryException` |
Runtime doesn’t recognize the stored FQCN, which can be caused by mismatched library versions. |
`SdkHydrationException` |
Middleware failed to build the SDK client, which can occur due to missing environment variables, reflection errors, credential failures, and similar runtime issues. |
`SdkTypeCreationException` |
Factory couldn’t turn metadata into the final SDK type, which is usually caused by a casting issues. |

Check the inner message for more details about the exact cause. Most SDK types issues are caused by misspelled environment variable names or missing dependencies.

## Bindings

Input and output bindings provide a declarative way to connect to data from within your code. A function can have multiple input and output bindings.

### Input binding example

```
package com.example;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
public class Function {
@FunctionName("echo")
public static String echo(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.PUT }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS, route = "items/{id}") String inputReq,
@TableInput(name = "item", tableName = "items", partitionKey = "Example", rowKey = "{id}", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") TestInputData inputData,
@TableOutput(name = "myOutputTable", tableName = "Person", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<Person> testOutputData
) {
testOutputData.setValue(new Person(httpbody + "Partition", httpbody + "Row", httpbody + "Name"));
return "Hello, " + inputReq + " and " + inputData.getKey() + ".";
}
public static class TestInputData {
public String getKey() { return this.rowKey; }
private String rowKey;
}
public static class Person {
public String partitionKey;
public String rowKey;
public String name;
public Person(String p, String r, String n) {
this.partitionKey = p;
this.rowKey = r;
this.name = n;
}
}
}
```


You invoke this function with an HTTP request.

- HTTP request payload is passed as a
`String`

for the argument`inputReq`

. - One entry is retrieved from Table storage, and is passed as
`TestInputData`

to the argument`inputData`

.

To receive a batch of inputs, you can bind to `String[]`

, `POJO[]`

, `List<String>`

, or `List<POJO>`

.

```
@FunctionName("ProcessIotMessages")
public void processIotMessages(
@EventHubTrigger(name = "message", eventHubName = "%AzureWebJobsEventHubPath%", connection = "AzureWebJobsEventHubSender", cardinality = Cardinality.MANY) List<TestEventData> messages,
final ExecutionContext context)
{
context.getLogger().info("Java Event Hub trigger received messages. Batch size: " + messages.size());
}
public class TestEventData {
public String id;
}
```


This function gets triggered whenever there's new data in the configured event hub. Because the `cardinality`

is set to `MANY`

, the function receives a batch of messages from the event hub. `EventData`

from event hub gets converted to `TestEventData`

for the function execution.

### Output binding example

You can bind an output binding to the return value by using `$return`

.

```
package com.example;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
public class Function {
@FunctionName("copy")
@StorageAccount("AzureWebJobsStorage")
@BlobOutput(name = "$return", path = "samples-output-java/{name}")
public static String copy(@BlobTrigger(name = "blob", path = "samples-input-java/{name}") String content) {
return content;
}
}
```


If there are multiple output bindings, use the return value for only one of them.

To send multiple output values, use `OutputBinding<T>`

defined in the `azure-functions-java-library`

package.

```
@FunctionName("QueueOutputPOJOList")
public HttpResponseMessage QueueOutputPOJOList(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.GET,
HttpMethod.POST }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "itemsOut", queueName = "test-output-java-pojo", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<List<TestData>> itemsOut,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
String query = request.getQueryParameters().get("queueMessageId");
String queueMessageId = request.getBody().orElse(query);
itemsOut.setValue(new ArrayList<TestData>());
if (queueMessageId != null) {
TestData testData1 = new TestData();
testData1.id = "msg1"+queueMessageId;
TestData testData2 = new TestData();
testData2.id = "msg2"+queueMessageId;
itemsOut.getValue().add(testData1);
itemsOut.getValue().add(testData2);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + queueMessageId).build();
} else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
.body("Did not find expected items in CosmosDB input list").build();
}
}
public static class TestData {
public String id;
}
```


You invoke this function on an `HttpRequest`

object. It writes multiple values to Queue storage.

## HttpRequestMessage and HttpResponseMessage

These helper types, which are designed to work with HTTP Trigger functions, are defined in `azure-functions-java-library`

:

| Specialized type | Target | Typical usage |
|---|---|---|
`HttpRequestMessage<T>` |
HTTP Trigger | Gets method, headers, or queries |
`HttpResponseMessage` |
HTTP Output Binding | Returns status other than 200 |

## Metadata

Few triggers send [trigger metadata](functions-triggers-bindings) along with input data. You can use annotation `@BindingName`

to bind to trigger metadata.

```
package com.example;
import java.util.Optional;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
public class Function {
@FunctionName("metadata")
public static String metadata(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = { HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST }, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) Optional<String> body,
@BindingName("name") String queryValue
) {
return body.orElse(queryValue);
}
}
```


In the preceding example, the `queryValue`

is bound to the query string parameter `name`

in the HTTP request URL, `http://{example.host}/api/metadata?name=test`

. Here's another example, showing how to bind to `Id`

from queue trigger metadata.

```
@FunctionName("QueueTriggerMetadata")
public void QueueTriggerMetadata(
@QueueTrigger(name = "message", queueName = "test-input-java-metadata", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") String message,@BindingName("Id") String metadataId,
@QueueOutput(name = "output", queueName = "test-output-java-metadata", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<TestData> output,
final ExecutionContext context
) {
context.getLogger().info("Java Queue trigger function processed a message: " + message + " with metadataId:" + metadataId );
TestData testData = new TestData();
testData.id = metadataId;
output.setValue(testData);
}
```


Note

The name provided in the annotation needs to match the metadata property.

## Execution context

`ExecutionContext`

, defined in the `azure-functions-java-library`

, contains helper methods that are used to communicate with the functions runtime. For more information, see the [ExecutionContext reference article](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.executioncontext).

### Logger

Use `getLogger`

, defined in `ExecutionContext`

, to write logs from function code.

Example:

```
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
public class Function {
public String echo(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) String req, ExecutionContext context) {
if (req.isEmpty()) {
context.getLogger().warning("Empty request body received by function " + context.getFunctionName() + " with invocation " + context.getInvocationId());
}
return String.format(req);
}
}
```


## View logs and trace

You can use the Azure CLI to stream Java stdout and stderr logging, and other application logging.

Here's how to configure your function app to write application logging by using the Azure CLI:

```
az webapp log config --name functionname --resource-group myResourceGroup --application-logging true
```


To stream logging output for your function app by using the Azure CLI, open a new command prompt, Bash, or Terminal session, and enter the following command:

The [az webapp log tail](/en-us/cli/azure/webapp/log) command has options to filter output by using the `--provider`

option.

To download the log files as a single ZIP file by using the Azure CLI, open a new command prompt, Bash, or Terminal session, and enter the following command:

```
az webapp log download --resource-group resourcegroupname --name functionappname
```


You must enable file system logging in the Azure portal or the Azure CLI before running this command.

## Environment variables

In Functions, [app settings](functions-app-settings), such as service connection strings, are exposed as environment variables during execution. You can access these settings by using, `System.getenv("AzureWebJobsStorage")`

.

The following example gets the [application setting](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings), with the key named `myAppSetting`

:

```
public class Function {
public String echo(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) String req, ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("My app setting value: "+ System.getenv("myAppSetting"));
return String.format(req);
}
}
```


## Use dependency injection in Java Functions

Azure Functions Java supports the dependency injection (DI) software design pattern, which is a technique to achieve [Inversion of Control (IoC)](/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) between classes and their dependencies. Java Azure Functions provides a hook to integrate with popular Dependency Injection frameworks in your Functions Apps. [Azure Functions Java SPI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-additions/tree/dev/azure-functions-java-spi) contains an interface [FunctionInstanceInjector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-additions/blob/dev/azure-functions-java-spi/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/spi/inject/FunctionInstanceInjector.java). By implementing this interface, you can return an instance of your function class and your functions are invoked on this instance. This gives frameworks like [Spring](/en-us/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/getting-started-with-spring-cloud-function-in-azure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-functions%2Ftoc.json), [Quarkus](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-quarkus), Google Guice, Dagger, etc. the ability to create the function instance and register it into their IOC container. This means you can use those Dependency Injection frameworks to manage your functions naturally.

Note

Microsoft Azure Functions Java SPI Types ([azure-function-java-spi](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.functions/azure-functions-java-spi/1.0.0)) is a package that contains all SPI interfaces for third parties to interact with Microsoft Azure functions runtime.

### Function instance injector for dependency injection

[azure-function-java-spi](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.functions/azure-functions-java-spi/1.0.0) contains an interface FunctionInstanceInjector

```
package com.microsoft.azure.functions.spi.inject;
/**
* The instance factory used by DI framework to initialize function instance.
*
* @since 1.0.0
*/
public interface FunctionInstanceInjector {
/**
* This method is used by DI framework to initialize the function instance. This method takes in the customer class and returns
* an instance create by the DI framework, later customer functions will be invoked on this instance.
* @param functionClass the class that contains customer functions
* @param <T> customer functions class type
* @return the instance that will be invoked on by azure functions java worker
* @throws Exception any exception that is thrown by the DI framework during instance creation
*/
<T> T getInstance(Class<T> functionClass) throws Exception;
}
```


For more examples that use FunctionInstanceInjector to integrate with Dependency injection frameworks refer to [this](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-worker/tree/dev/samples/dependency-injection-example) repository.

[Support for the in-process model ends on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you migrate your apps to the isolated worker model by following the instructions in this article.

This article walks you through the process of safely migrating your .NET function app from the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library) to the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). To learn about the high-level differences between these models, see the [execution mode comparison](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

This guide assumes that your app is running on version 4.x of the Functions runtime. If not, you should use the following guides to upgrade your host version. These host-version migration guides also help you migrate to the isolated worker model as you work through them.

[Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 2.x and 3.x to version 4.x](migrate-version-3-version-4)[Migrate apps from Azure Functions version 1.x to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4)

When supported, this article takes advantage of [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) in the isolated worker model, which improves performance and provides a familiar programming model when your app uses HTTP triggers.

## Identify function apps to migrate

Use the following Azure PowerShell script to generate a list of function apps in your subscription that currently use the in-process model.

The script uses the subscription that Azure PowerShell is currently configured to use. You can change the subscription by first running `Set-AzContext -Subscription '<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>'`

and replacing `<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>`

with the ID of the subscription you would like to evaluate.

```
$FunctionApps = Get-AzFunctionApp
$AppInfo = @{}
foreach ($App in $FunctionApps)
{
if ($App.Runtime -eq 'dotnet')
{
$AppInfo.Add($App.Name, $App.Runtime)
}
}
$AppInfo
```


## Choose your target .NET version

On version 4.x of the Functions runtime, your .NET function app targets .NET 6 or .NET 8 when using the in-process model.

When you migrate your function app, you have the opportunity to choose the target version of .NET. You can update your C# project to one of the following versions of .NET that are supported by Functions version 4.x:

| .NET version |
|
|---|

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide)3[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide)[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide),[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library)2[See policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework)[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide)1 The [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) supports Long Term Support (LTS) and Standard Term Support (STS) versions of .NET, as well as .NET Framework. The [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library) only supports LTS releases of .NET, ending with .NET 8. For a full feature and functionality comparison between the two models, see [Differences between in-process and isolate worker process .NET Azure Functions](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

2 Support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

3 .NET 9 previously had an expected end-of-support date of May 12, 2026. During the .NET 9 service window, the .NET team extended support for STS versions to 24 months, starting with .NET 9. For more information, see [the blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-sts-releases-supported-for-24-months/).

Tip

**We recommend upgrading to .NET 8 on the isolated worker model.** This provides a quick migration path to the fully released version with the longest support window from .NET.

This guide doesn't present specific examples for .NET 10 (preview) or .NET 9. If you need to target one of those versions, you can adapt the .NET 8 examples.

## Prepare for migration

Before you migrate an app to the isolated worker model, you should thoroughly review the contents of this guide. You should also familiarize yourself with the features of the [isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) and the [differences between the two models](dotnet-isolated-in-process-differences).

To migrate the application:

- Migrate your local project to the isolated worker model by following the steps in
[Migrate your local project](#migrate-your-local-project). - After migrating your project, fully test the app locally using version 4.x of the
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local). [Update your function app in Azure](#update-your-function-app-in-azure)to the isolated model.

## Migrate your local project

The section outlines the various changes that you need to make to your local project to move it to the isolated worker model. Some of the steps change based on your target version of .NET. Use the tabs to select the instructions that match your desired version.

Tip

If you're moving to an LTS or STS version of .NET, the [.NET Upgrade Assistant](/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) can be used to automatically make many of the changes mentioned in the following sections.

First, convert the project file and update your dependencies. As you do, you see build errors for the project. In subsequent steps, you'll make the corresponding changes to remove these errors.

### Project file

The following example is a *.csproj* project file that uses .NET 8 on version 4.x:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
<RootNamespace>My.Namespace</RootNamespace>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions" Version="4.1.1" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<None Update="host.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</None>
<None Update="local.settings.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
<CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


Use one of the following procedures to update this XML file to run in the isolated worker model:

These steps assume a local C# project; if your app instead uses C# script (*.csx* files), you should [convert to the project model](functions-reference-csharp#convert-a-c-script-app-to-a-c-project) before continuing.

The following changes are required in the *.csproj* XML project file:

Set the value of

`PropertyGroup`

.`TargetFramework`

to`net8.0`

.Set the value of

`PropertyGroup`

.`AzureFunctionsVersion`

to`v4`

.Add the following

`OutputType`

element to the`PropertyGroup`

:`<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`

In the

`ItemGroup`

.`PackageReference`

list, replace the package reference to`Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`

with the following references:`<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker" Version="1.21.0" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk" Version="1.17.2" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore" Version="1.2.1" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService" Version="2.22.0" /> <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.ApplicationInsights" Version="1.2.0" />`

Make note of any references to other packages in the

`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.*`

namespaces. You'll replace these packages in a later step.Add the following new

`ItemGroup`

:`<ItemGroup> <Using Include="System.Threading.ExecutionContext" Alias="ExecutionContext"/> </ItemGroup>`


After you make these changes, your updated project should look like the following example:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
<AzureFunctionsVersion>v4</AzureFunctionsVersion>
<RootNamespace>My.Namespace</RootNamespace>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
<Nullable>enable</Nullable>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker" Version="1.21.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk" Version="1.17.2" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore" Version="1.2.1" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService" Version="2.22.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.ApplicationInsights" Version="1.2.0" />
<!-- Other packages may also be in this list -->
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<None Update="host.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
</None>
<None Update="local.settings.json">
<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
<CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>
</None>
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<Using Include="System.Threading.ExecutionContext" Alias="ExecutionContext"/>
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


Changing your project's target framework might also require changes to parts of your toolchain, outside of project code. For example, in VS Code, you might need to update the `azureFunctions.deploySubpath`

extension setting through user settings or your project's *.vscode/settings.json* file. Check for any dependencies on the framework version that might exist outside of your project code, as part of build steps or a CI/CD pipeline.

### Package references

When migrating to the isolated worker model, you need to change the packages your application references.

If you haven't already, update your project to reference the latest stable versions of:

Depending on the triggers and bindings your app uses, your app might need to reference a different set of packages. The following table shows the replacements for some of the most commonly used extensions:

| Scenario | Changes to package references |
|---|---|
| Timer trigger | Add
|
| Storage bindings | Replace`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage` with
|
| Blob bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage.Blobs` with the latest version of
|
| Queue bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage.Queues` with the latest version of
|
| Table bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Tables` with the latest version of
|
| Cosmos DB bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB` and/or `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB` with the latest version of
|
| Service Bus bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus` with the latest version of
|
| Event Hubs bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs` with the latest version of
|
| Event Grid bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventGrid` with the latest version of
|
| SignalR Service bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.SignalRService` with the latest version of
|
| Durable Functions | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask` with the latest version of
|
| Durable Functions (SQL storage provider) |
Replace references to`Microsoft.DurableTask.SqlServer.AzureFunctions` with the latest version of
|
| Durable Functions (Netherite storage provider) |
Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions` with the latest version of
|
| SendGrid bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.SendGrid` with the latest version of
|
| Kafka bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kafka` with the latest version of
|
| RabbitMQ bindings | Replace references to`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.RabbitMQ` with the latest version of
|
| Dependency injection and startup config |
Remove references to`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions` (The isolated worker model provides this functionality by default.) |

See [Supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings) for a complete list of extensions to consider, and consult each extension's documentation for full installation instructions for the isolated process model. Be sure to install the latest stable version of any packages you are targeting.

Tip

Any changes to extension versions during this process might require you to update your `host.json`

file as well. Be sure to read the documentation of each extension that you use.
For example, the Service Bus extension has breaking changes in the structure between versions 4.x and 5.x. For more information, see [Azure Service Bus bindings for Azure Functions](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-service-bus?tabs=isolated-process%2Cextensionv5%2Cextensionv3&pivots=programming-language-csharp#hostjson-settings).

**Your isolated worker model application should not reference any packages in the Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.* namespaces or Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.** If you have any remaining references to these, they should be removed.


Tip

Your app might also depend on Azure SDK types, either as part of your triggers and bindings or as a standalone dependency. You should take this opportunity to update these as well. The latest versions of the Functions extensions work with the latest versions of the [Azure SDK for .NET](/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet), almost all of the packages for which are the form `Azure.*`

.

### Program.cs file

When migrating to run in an isolated worker process, you must add a *Program.cs* file to your project with the following contents:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
var host = new HostBuilder()
.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication()
.ConfigureServices(services => {
services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryWorkerService();
services.ConfigureFunctionsApplicationInsights();
})
.Build();
host.Run();
```


This example includes [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) to improve performance and provide a familiar programming model when your app uses HTTP triggers. If you don't intend to use HTTP triggers, you can replace the call to `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication`

with a call to `ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults`

. If you do so, you can remove the reference to `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore`

from your project file. However, for the best performance, even for functions with other trigger types, you should keep the `FrameworkReference`

to ASP.NET Core.

The *Program.cs* file replaces any file that has the `FunctionsStartup`

attribute, which is typically a *Startup.cs* file. In places where your `FunctionsStartup`

code would reference `IFunctionsHostBuilder.Services`

, you can instead add statements within the `.ConfigureServices()`

method of the `HostBuilder`

in your *Program.cs*. To learn more about working with *Program.cs*, see [Start-up and configuration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration) in the isolated worker model guide.

The default *Program.cs* examples previously described include setup of [Application Insights](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#application-insights). In your *Program.cs*, you must also configure any log filtering that should apply to logs coming from code in your project. In the isolated worker model, the *host.json* file only controls events emitted by the Functions host runtime. If you don't configure filtering rules in *Program.cs*, you might see differences in the log levels present for various categories in your telemetry.

Although you can register custom configuration sources as part of the `HostBuilder`

, these similarly apply only to code in your project. The platform also needs trigger and binding configuration, and this should be provided through the [application settings](../app-service/configure-common#configure-app-settings), [Key Vault references](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json), or [App Configuration references](../app-service/app-service-configuration-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json) features.

After you move everything from any existing `FunctionsStartup`

to the *Program.cs* file, you can delete the `FunctionsStartup`

attribute and the class it was applied to.

### Function signature changes

Some key types change between the in-process model and the isolated worker model. Many of these relate to the attributes, parameters, and return types that make up the function signature. For each of your functions, you must make changes to:

- The function attribute, which also sets the function's name
- How the function obtains an
`ILogger`

/`ILogger<T>`

- Trigger and binding attributes and parameters

The rest of this section walks you through each of these steps.

#### Function attributes

The `Function`

attribute in the isolated worker model replaces the `FunctionName`

attribute. The new attribute has the same signature, and the only difference is in the name. You can therefore just perform a string replacement across your project.

#### Logging

In the in-process model, you could include an optional `ILogger`

parameter for your function, or you could use dependency injection to get an `ILogger<T>`

. If your app already used dependency injection, the same mechanisms work in the isolated worker model.

However, for any Functions that relied on the `ILogger`

method parameter, you need to make a change. We recommended that you use dependency injection to obtain an `ILogger<T>`

. Use the following steps to migrate the function's logging mechanism:

In your function class, add a

`private readonly ILogger<MyFunction> _logger;`

property, replacing`MyFunction`

with the name of your function class.Create a constructor for your function class that takes in the

`ILogger<T>`

as a parameter:`public MyFunction(ILogger<MyFunction> logger) { _logger = logger; }`

Replace both instances of

`MyFunction`

in the preceding code snippet with the name of your function class.For logging operations in your function code, replace references to the

`ILogger`

parameter with`_logger`

.Remove the

`ILogger`

parameter from your function signature.

To learn more, see [Logging in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#logging).

#### Trigger and binding changes

When you [changed your package references in a previous step](#package-references), you introduced errors for your triggers and bindings that you can now fix:

Remove any

`using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;`

statements.Add a

`using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;`

statement.For each binding attribute, change the attribute's name as specified in its reference documentation, which you can find in the

[Supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings)index. In general, the attribute names change as follows:**Triggers typically remain named the same way.**For example,`QueueTrigger`

is the attribute name for both models.**Input bindings typically need**For example, if you used the`Input`

added to their name.`CosmosDB`

input binding attribute in the in-process model, the attribute would now be`CosmosDBInput`

.**Output bindings typically need**For example, if you used the`Output`

added to their name.`Queue`

output binding attribute in the in-process model, this attribute would now be`QueueOutput`

.

Update the attribute parameters to reflect the isolated worker model version, as specified in the binding's reference documentation.

For example, in the in-process model, a blob output binding is represented by a

`[Blob(...)]`

attribute that includes an`Access`

property. In the isolated worker model, the blob output attribute would be`[BlobOutput(...)]`

. The binding no longer requires the`Access`

property, so that parameter can be removed. So`[Blob("sample-images-sm/{fileName}", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "MyStorageConnection")]`

would become`[BlobOutput("sample-images-sm/{fileName}", Connection = "MyStorageConnection")]`

.Move output bindings out of the function parameter list. If you have just one output binding, you can apply this to the return type of the function. If you have multiple outputs, create a new class with properties for each output, and apply the attributes to those properties. To learn more, see

[Multiple output bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#multiple-output-bindings).Consult each binding's reference documentation for the types it allows you to bind to. In some cases, you might need to change the type. For output bindings, if the in-process model version used an

`IAsyncCollector<T>`

, you can replace this with binding to an array of the target type:`T[]`

. You can also consider replacing the output binding with a client object for the service it represents, either as the binding type for an input binding if available, or by[injecting a client yourself](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients).If your function includes an

`IBinder`

parameter, remove it. Replace the functionality with a client object for the service it represents, either as the binding type for an input binding if available, or by[injecting a client yourself](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients).Update the function code to work with any new types.


### local.settings.json file

The *local.settings.json* file is only used when running locally. For information, see [Local settings file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file).

When migrating from running in-process to running in an isolated worker process, you need to change the `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

value to *dotnet-isolated*. Make sure that your *local.settings.json* file has at least the following elements:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"
}
}
```


The value you have for `AzureWebJobsStorage`

might be different. You don't need to change its value as part of the migration.

### host.json file

No changes are required to your *host.json* file. However, if your Application Insights configuration is in this file from your in-process model project, you might want to make additional changes in your *Program.cs* file. The *host.json* file only controls logging from the Functions host runtime, and in the isolated worker model, some of these logs come from your application directly, giving you more control. See [Managing log levels in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#managing-log-levels) for details on how to filter these logs.

### Other code changes

This section highlights other code changes to consider as you work through the migration. These changes aren't needed by all applications, but you should evaluate if any are relevant to your scenarios.

#### JSON serialization

By default, the isolated worker model uses *System.Text.Json* for JSON serialization. To customize serializer options or switch to JSON.NET (*Newtonsoft.Json*), see [Customizing JSON serialization](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#customizing-json-serialization).

#### Application Insights log levels and filtering

Logs can be sent to Application Insights from both the Functions host runtime and code in your project. The *host.json* allows you to configure rules for host logging, but to control logs coming from your code, you need to configure filtering rules as part of your *Program.cs*. See [Managing log levels in the isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#managing-log-levels) for details on how to filter these logs.

### Example function migrations

#### HTTP trigger example

An HTTP trigger for the in-process model might look like the following example:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace Company.Function
{
public static class HttpTriggerCSharp
{
[FunctionName("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");
}
}
}
```


An HTTP trigger for the migrated version might look like the following example:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace Company.Function
{
public class HttpTriggerCSharp
{
private readonly ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> _logger;
public HttpTriggerCSharp(ILogger<HttpTriggerCSharp> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
[Function("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
public IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")] HttpRequest req)
{
_logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult($"Welcome to Azure Functions, {req.Query["name"]}!");
}
}
}
```


## Update your function app in Azure

Updating your function app to the isolated model involves two changes that should be completed together, because if you only complete one, the app is in an error state. Both of these changes also cause the app process to restart. For these reasons, you should perform the update using a [staging slot](functions-deployment-slots). Staging slots help minimize downtime for your app and allow you to test and verify your migrated code with your updated configuration in Azure. You can then deploy your fully migrated app to the production slot through a swap operation.

Important

When an app's deployed payload doesn't match the configured runtime, it's in [an error state](errors-diagnostics/diagnostic-events/azfd0013). During the migration process, you put the app into this state, ideally only temporarily. Deployment slots help mitigate the effect of this, because the error state will be resolved in your staging (nonproduction) environment before the changes are applied as single update to your production environment. Slots also defend against any mistakes and allow you to detect any other issues before reaching production.

During the process, you might still see errors in logs coming from your staging (nonproduction) slot. This is expected, though these should go away as you proceed through the steps. Before you perform the slot swap operation, you should confirm that these errors stop being raised and that your application is working as expected.

Use the following steps to use deployment slots to update your function app to the isolated worker model:

[Create a deployment slot](functions-deployment-slots#add-a-slot)if you haven't already. You might also want to familiarize yourself with the slot swap process and ensure that you can make updates to the existing application with minimal disruption.Change the configuration of the staging (nonproduction) slot to use the isolated worker model by setting the

`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

application setting to`dotnet-isolated`

.`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

should**not**be marked as a*slot setting*.If you're also targeting a different version of .NET as part of your update, you should also change the stack configuration. To do so, see

[Update the stack configuration](update-language-versions?pivots=programming-language-csharp#update-the-stack-configuration). You can use the same instructions for any future .NET version updates you make.If you have any automated infrastructure provisioning such as a CI/CD pipeline, make sure that the automations are also updated to keep

`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

set to`dotnet-isolated`

and to target the correct .NET version.Publish your migrated project to the staging (nonproduction) slot of your function app.

If you use Visual Studio to publish an isolated worker model project to an existing app or slot that uses the in-process model, it can also complete the previous step for you at the same time. If you didn't complete the previous step, Visual Studio prompts you to update the function app during deployment. Visual Studio presents this as a single operation, but these are still two separate operations. You might still see errors in your logs from the staging (nonproduction) slot during the interim state.

Confirm that your application is working as expected within the staging (nonproduction) slot.

Perform a

[slot swap operation](functions-deployment-slots#swap-slots)to apply the changes you made in your staging (nonproduction) slot to the production slot. A slot swap happens as a single update, which avoids introducing the interim error state in your production environment.Confirm that your application is working as expected within the production slot.


Once you complete these steps, the migration is complete, and your app runs on the isolated model. Congratulations! Repeat the steps from this guide as necessary for [any other apps that need migration](#identify-function-apps-to-migrate).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use [Azure Pipelines](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/) to automatically deploy your code project to a function app in Azure. Azure Pipelines lets you build, test, and deploy with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) using [Azure DevOps](/en-us/azure/devops/).

YAML pipelines are defined using a YAML file in your repository. A step is the smallest building block of a pipeline and can be a script or task (prepackaged script). [Learn about the key concepts and components that make up a pipeline](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts).

You use the `AzureFunctionApp`

task to deploy your code. There are now two versions of `AzureFunctionApp`

, which are compared in this table:

| Comparison/version |
|
|---|

[AzureFunctionApp@1](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-app-v1)

[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan)** Enhanced validation support makes pipelines less likely to fail because of errors.

Choose your task version at the top of the article.

Note

Upgrade from `AzureFunctionApp@1`

to `AzureFunctionApp@2`

for access to new features and long-term support.

## Prerequisites

An Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can

[create one for free](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up). If your team already has one, then make sure you're an administrator of the Azure DevOps project that you want to use.An ability to run pipelines on Microsoft-hosted agents. You can either purchase a

[parallel job](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs)or you can request a free tier.If you plan to use GitHub instead of Azure Repos, you also need a GitHub repository. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can

[create one for free](https://github.com).An existing function app in Azure that has its source code in a supported repository. If you don't yet have an Azure Functions code project, you can create one by completing the following language-specific article:


Remember to upload the local code project to your GitHub or Azure Repos repository after you publish it to your function app.

## Build your app

- Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.
- In your project, navigate to the
**Pipelines**page. Then choose the action to create a new pipeline. - Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting
**GitHub**as the location of your source code. - You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If so, enter your GitHub credentials.
- When the list of repositories appears, select your sample app repository.
- Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository and recommend a template. Select
**Save and run**, then select**Commit directly to the main branch**, and then choose**Save and run**again. - A new run is started. Wait for the run to finish.

### Example YAML build pipelines

The following language-specific pipelines can be used for building apps.

You can use the following sample to create a YAML file to build a .NET app:

```
pool:
vmImage: 'windows-latest'
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
displayName: 'Install .NET 8.0 SDK'
inputs:

artifactName: 'drop'
```


## Deploy your app

You'll deploy with the [Azure Function App Deploy v2](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-app-v2) task. This task requires an [Azure service connection](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) as an input. An Azure service connection stores the credentials to connect from Azure Pipelines to Azure. You should create a connection that uses [workload identity federation](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-that-uses-workload-identity-federation).

To deploy to Azure Functions, add this snippet at the end of your `azure-pipelines.yml`

file, depending on whether your app runs on Linux or Windows:

```
trigger:
- main
variables:
# Azure service connection established during pipeline creation
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
appName: <Name of the function app>
# Agent VM image name
vmImageName: 'windows-latest'
- task: AzureFunctionApp@2 # Add this at the end of your file
inputs:
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
appType: functionApp # this specifies a Windows-based function app
appName: $(appName)
package: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/build$(Build.BuildId).zip
deploymentMethod: 'auto' # 'auto' | 'zipDeploy' | 'runFromPackage'. Required. Deployment method. Default: auto.
#Uncomment the next lines to deploy to a deployment slot
#Note that deployment slots is not supported for Linux Dynamic SKU
#deployToSlotOrASE: true
#resourceGroupName: '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'
#slotName: '<SLOT_NAME>'
```


The default `appType`

is Windows (`functionApp`

). You can specify Linux by setting the `appType`

to `functionAppLinux`

. A [Flex Consumption](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan) app runs on Linux, and you to must set both `appType: functionAppLinux`

and `isFlexConsumption: true`

.

The snippet assumes that the build steps in your YAML file produce the zip archive in the `$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)`

folder on your agent.

You deploy using the [Azure Function App Deploy](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/deploy/azure-function-app) task. This task requires an [Azure service connection](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints) as an input. An Azure service connection stores the credentials to connect from Azure Pipelines to Azure.

Important

Deploying to a Flex Consumption app isn't supported using @v1 of the `AzureFunctionApp`

task.

To deploy to Azure Functions, add this snippet at the end of your `azure-pipelines.yml`

file:

```
trigger:
- main
variables:
# Azure service connection established during pipeline creation
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
appName: <Name of the function app>
# Agent VM image name
vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
- task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@1 # Add this at the end of your file
inputs:
buildType: 'current'
downloadType: 'single'
artifactName: 'drop'
itemPattern: '**/*.zip'
downloadPath: '$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)'
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1
inputs:
azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
appType: functionAppLinux # default is functionApp
appName: $(appName)
package: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/**/*.zip
```


This snippet sets the `appType`

to `functionAppLinux`

, which is required when deploying to an app that runs on Linux. The default `appType`

is Windows (`functionApp`

).

The example assumes that the build steps in your YAML file produce the zip archive in the `$(System.ArtifactsDirectory)`

folder on your agent.

## Deploy a container

Tip

We recommend using the Azure Functions support in Azure Container Apps for hosting your function app in a custom Linux container. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps overview](../container-apps/functions-overview).

When deploying a containerized function app, the deployment task you use depends on the specific hosting environment.

You can use the [Azure Container Apps Deploy](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-container-apps-v1) task (`AzureContainerApps`

) to deploy a function app image to an Azure Container App instance that is optimized for Azure Functions.

This code deploys the base image for a .NET 8 isolated process model function app:

```
trigger:
- main
pool:
vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
steps:
- task: AzureContainerApps@1
inputs:
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
imageToDeploy: 'mcr.microsoft.com/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated:4-dotnet-isolated8.0'
containerAppName: <Name of your container app>
resourceGroup: <Name of the resource group>
```


Ideally, you would build your own custom container in the pipeline instead of using a base image, as shown in this example. For more information, see [Deploy to Azure Container Apps from Azure Pipelines](../container-apps/azure-pipelines).

## Deploy to a slot

Important

The Flex Consumption plan doesn't currently support slots.
Linux apps also don't support slots when running in a Consumption plan, and [support for these apps is being retired in the future](consumption-plan).

```
trigger:
- main
variables:
# Azure service connection established during pipeline creation
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
appName: <Name of the function app>
# Agent VM image name
vmImageName: 'windows-latest'
- task: AzureFunctionApp@2 # Add this at the end of your file
inputs:
azureSubscription: <Name of your Azure subscription>
appType: functionApp # this specifies a Windows-based function app
appName: $(appName)
package: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/build$(Build.BuildId).zip
deploymentMethod: 'auto' # 'auto' | 'zipDeploy' | 'runFromPackage'. Required. Deployment method. Default: auto.
deployToSlotOrASE: true
resourceGroupName: '<RESOURCE_GROUP>'
slotName: '<SLOT_NAME>'
```


You can configure your function app to have multiple slots. Slots allow you to safely deploy your app and test it before making it available to your customers.

The following YAML snippet shows how to deploy to a staging slot, and then swap to a production slot:

```
- task: AzureFunctionApp@1
inputs:
azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
appType: functionAppLinux
appName: <Name of the function app>
package: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/**/*.zip
deployToSlotOrASE: true
resourceGroupName: <Name of the resource group>
slotName: staging
- task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
inputs:
azureSubscription: <Azure service connection>
WebAppName: <name of the function app>
ResourceGroupName: <name of resource group>
SourceSlot: staging
SwapWithProduction: true
```


When using [deployment slots](functions-deployment-slots), you can also add the following task to perform a slot swap as part of your deployment.

```
- task: AzureAppServiceManage@0
inputs:
azureSubscription: <AZURE_SERVICE_CONNECTION>
WebAppName: <APP_NAME>
ResourceGroupName: <RESOURCE_GROUP>
SourceSlot: <SLOT_NAME>
SwapWithProduction: true
```


## Create a pipeline with Azure CLI

To create a build pipeline in Azure, use the `az functionapp devops-pipeline create`

[command](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/devops-pipeline#az-functionapp-devops-pipeline-create). The build pipeline is created to build and release any code changes that are made in your repo. The command generates a new YAML file that defines the build and release pipeline and then commits it to your repo. The prerequisites for this command depend on the location of your code.

If your code is in GitHub:

You must have

**write**permissions for your subscription.You must be the project administrator in Azure DevOps.

You must have permissions to create a GitHub personal access token (PAT) that has sufficient permissions. For more information, see

[GitHub PAT permission requirements.](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/github#repository-permissions-for-personal-access-token-pat-authentication)You must have permissions to commit to the main branch in your GitHub repository so you can commit the autogenerated YAML file.


If your code is in Azure Repos:

You must have

**write**permissions for your subscription.You must be the project administrator in Azure DevOps.

# Azure Notification Hubs output bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to send push notifications by using [Azure Notification Hubs](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-overview) bindings in Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports output bindings for Notification Hubs.

You must configure Notification Hubs for the Platform Notifications Service (PNS) you want to use. For more information about how to get push notifications in your client app from Notification Hubs, see [Quickstart: Set up push notifications in a notification hub](../notification-hubs/configure-notification-hub-portal-pns-settings).

Important

Google has [deprecated Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in favor of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/faq). However, output bindings for Notification Hubs doesn't support FCM. To send notifications using FCM, use the [Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server#choosing-a-server-option) directly in your function or use [template notifications](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages).

## Packages: Functions 1.x

Important

[Support will end for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) for full support.

The Notification Hubs bindings are provided in the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.NotificationHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.NotificationHubs) NuGet package, version 1.x. Source code for the package is in the [azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/tree/v2.x/src/WebJobs.Extensions.NotificationHubs) GitHub repository.

The following table lists how to add support for output binding in each development environment.

| Development environment | To add support in Functions 1.x |
|---|---|
| Local development: C# class library |
|

## Packages: Functions 2.x and higher

Output binding isn't available in Functions 2.x and higher.

## Example: template

The notifications you send can be native notifications or [template notifications](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages). A native notification targets a specific client platform, as configured in the `platform`

property of the output binding. A template notification can be used to target multiple platforms.

Template examples for each language:

[C# script: out parameter](#c-script-template-example-out-parameter)[C# script: asynchronous](#c-script-template-example-asynchronous)[C# script: JSON](#c-script-template-example-json)[C# script: library types](#c-script-template-example-library-types)[F#](#f-template-example)[JavaScript](#javascript-template-example)

### C# script template example: out parameter

This example sends a notification for a [template registration](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages) that contains a `message`

placeholder in the template:

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Collections.Generic;
public static void Run(string myQueueItem, out IDictionary<string, string> notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
notification = GetTemplateProperties(myQueueItem);
}
private static IDictionary<string, string> GetTemplateProperties(string message)
{
Dictionary<string, string> templateProperties = new Dictionary<string, string>();
templateProperties["message"] = message;
return templateProperties;
}
```


### C# script template example: asynchronous

If you're using asynchronous code, out parameters aren't allowed. In this case, use `IAsyncCollector`

to return your template notification. The following code is an asynchronous example of the previous example:

```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Collections.Generic;
public static async Task Run(string myQueueItem, IAsyncCollector<IDictionary<string,string>> notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
log.Info($"Sending Template Notification to Notification Hub");
await notification.AddAsync(GetTemplateProperties(myQueueItem));
}
private static IDictionary<string, string> GetTemplateProperties(string message)
{
Dictionary<string, string> templateProperties = new Dictionary<string, string>();
templateProperties["user"] = "A new user wants to be added : " + message;
return templateProperties;
}
```


### C# script template example: JSON

This example sends a notification for a [template registration](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages) that contains a `message`

placeholder in the template using a valid JSON string:

```
using System;
public static void Run(string myQueueItem, out string notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
notification = "{\"message\":\"Hello from C#. Processed a queue item!\"}";
}
```


### C# script template example: library types

This example shows how to use types defined in the [Microsoft Azure Notification Hubs Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs/):

```
#r "Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs"
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs;
public static void Run(string myQueueItem, out Notification notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
notification = GetTemplateNotification(myQueueItem);
}
private static TemplateNotification GetTemplateNotification(string message)
{
Dictionary<string, string> templateProperties = new Dictionary<string, string>();
templateProperties["message"] = message;
return new TemplateNotification(templateProperties);
}
```


### F# template example

This example sends a notification for a [template registration](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages) that contains `location`

and `message`

:

```
let Run(myTimer: TimerInfo, notification: byref<IDictionary<string, string>>) =
notification = dict [("location", "Redmond"); ("message", "Hello from F#!")]
```


### JavaScript template example

This example sends a notification for a [template registration](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages) that contains `location`

and `message`

:

```
module.exports = async function (context, myTimer) {
var timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
if (myTimer.IsPastDue)
{
context.log('Node.js is running late!');
}
context.log('Node.js timer trigger function ran!', timeStamp);
context.bindings.notification = {
location: "Redmond",
message: "Hello from Node!"
};
};
```


## Example: APNS native

This C# script example shows how to send a native Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) notification:

```
#r "Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs"
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"
using System;
using Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
public static async Task Run(string myQueueItem, IAsyncCollector<Notification> notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
// In this example, the queue item is a new user to be processed in the form of a JSON string with
// a "name" value.
//
// The JSON format for a native Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) notification is:
// { "aps": { "alert": "notification message" }}
log.LogInformation($"Sending APNS notification of a new user");
dynamic user = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(myQueueItem);
string apnsNotificationPayload = "{\"aps\": {\"alert\": \"A new user wants to be added (" +
user.name + ")\" }}";
log.LogInformation($"{apnsNotificationPayload}");
await notification.AddAsync(new AppleNotification(apnsNotificationPayload));
}
```


## Example: WNS native

This C# script example shows how to use types defined in the [Microsoft Azure Notification Hubs Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs/) to send a native Windows Push Notification Service (WNS) toast notification:

```
#r "Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs"
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"
using System;
using Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
public static async Task Run(string myQueueItem, IAsyncCollector<Notification> notification, TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
// In this example, the queue item is a new user to be processed in the form of a JSON string with
// a "name" value.
//
// The XML format for a native WNS toast notification is ...
// <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
// <toast>
// <visual>
// <binding template="ToastText01">
// <text id="1">notification message</text>
// </binding>
// </visual>
// </toast>
log.Info($"Sending WNS toast notification of a new user");
dynamic user = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(myQueueItem);
string wnsNotificationPayload = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>" +
"<toast><visual><binding template=\"ToastText01\">" +
"<text id=\"1\">" +
"A new user wants to be added (" + user.name + ")" +
"</text>" +
"</binding></visual></toast>";
log.Info($"{wnsNotificationPayload}");
await notification.AddAsync(new WindowsNotification(wnsNotificationPayload));
}
```


## Attributes

In [C# class libraries](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the [NotificationHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/v2.x/src/WebJobs.Extensions.NotificationHubs/NotificationHubAttribute.cs) attribute.

The attribute's constructor parameters and properties are described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Configuration

The following table lists the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `NotificationHub`

attribute:

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Set to `notificationHub` . |
direction |
n/a | Set to `out` . |
name |
n/a | Variable name used in function code for the notification hub message. |
tagExpression |
TagExpression |
Tag expressions allow you to specify that notifications be delivered to a set of devices that are registered to receive notifications matching the tag expression. For more information, see
|

**hubName****HubName****connection****ConnectionStringSetting***DefaultFullSharedAccessSignature*value for your notification hub. For more information, see[Connection string setup](#connection-string-setup).**platform****Platform**[Notification Hubs templates](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-templates-cross-platform-push-messages). When**platform**is set, it must be one of the following values:`apns`

: Apple Push Notification Service. For more information on configuring the notification hub for APNS and receiving the notification in a client app, see[Send push notifications to .NET MAUI apps using Azure Notification Hubs via a backend service](/en-us/dotnet/maui/data-cloud/push-notifications).`adm`

:[Amazon Device Messaging](https://developer.amazon.com/device-messaging). For more information on configuring the notification hub for Azure Deployment Manager (ADM) and receiving the notification in a Kindle app, see[Send push notifications to Android devices using Firebase SDK](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-android-push-notification-google-fcm-get-started).`wns`

:[Windows Push Notification Services](/en-us/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/windows-push-notification-services--wns--overview)targeting Windows platforms. WNS also supports Windows Phone 8.1 and later. For more information, see[Send notifications to Universal Windows Platform apps using Azure Notification Hubs](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-wns-push-notification).`mpns`

:[Microsoft Push Notification Service](/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/ff402558(v=vs.105)). This platform supports Windows Phone 8 and earlier Windows Phone platforms. For more information, see[Send notifications to Universal Windows Platform apps using Azure Notification Hubs](../notification-hubs/notification-hubs-windows-mobile-push-notifications-mpns).

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

### function.json file example

Here's an example of a Notification Hubs binding in a *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "notificationHub",
"direction": "out",
"name": "notification",
"tagExpression": "",
"hubName": "my-notification-hub",
"connection": "MyHubConnectionString",
"platform": "apns"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


### Connection string setup

To use a notification hub output binding, you must configure the connection string for the hub.

Important

The Notification Hubs binding doesn't support Microsoft Entra authentication and managed identities. You can use Azure Key Vault to centrally manage your notification hub connection string and help with key rotation. To learn more, see [Manage Connections](manage-connections).

You can select an existing notification hub or create a new one from the **Integrate** tab in the Azure portal. You can also configure the connection string manually.

To configure the connection string to an existing notification hub:

Navigate to your notification hub in the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Access policies**, and select the copy button next to the**DefaultFullSharedAccessSignature**policy.The connection string for the

*DefaultFullSharedAccessSignature*policy is copied to your notification hub. This connection string lets your function send notification messages to the hub.Navigate to your function app in the Azure portal, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.From the

**App setting**tab, select**+ Add**to add a key such as**MyHubConnectionString**. The**Name**of this app setting is the output binding connection setting in*function.json*or the .NET attribute. For more information, see[Configuration](#configuration).For the value, paste the copied

*DefaultFullSharedAccessSignature*connection string from your notification hub, and then select**Apply**.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

# Improve the performance and reliability of Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides guidance to improve the performance and reliability of your [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/) function apps. For a more general set of Azure Functions best practices, see [Azure Functions best practices](functions-best-practices).

The following are best practices in how you build and architect your serverless solutions using Azure Functions.

## Avoid long running functions

Large, long-running functions can cause unexpected timeout issues. To learn more about the timeouts for a given hosting plan, see [function app timeout duration](functions-scale#timeout).

A function can become large because of many Node.js dependencies. Importing dependencies can also cause increased load times that result in unexpected timeouts. Dependencies are loaded both explicitly and implicitly. A single module loaded by your code may load its own additional modules.

Whenever possible, refactor large functions into smaller function sets that work together and return responses fast. For example, a webhook or HTTP trigger function might require an acknowledgment response within a certain time limit; it's common for webhooks to require an immediate response. You can pass the HTTP trigger payload into a queue to be processed by a queue trigger function. This approach lets you defer the actual work and return an immediate response.

## Make sure background tasks complete

When your function starts any tasks, callbacks, threads, processes, they must complete before your function code returns. Because Functions doesn't track these background threads, site shutdown can occur regardless of background thread status, which can cause unintended behavior in your functions.

For example, if a function starts a background task and returns a successful response before the task completes, the Functions runtime considers the execution as having completed successfully, regardless of the result of the background task. If this background task is performing essential work, it may be preempted by site shutdown, leaving that work in an unknown state.

## Cross function communication

[Durable Functions](durable/durable-functions-overview) and [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview) are built to manage state transitions and communication between multiple functions.

If not using Durable Functions or Logic Apps to integrate with multiple functions, it's best to use storage queues for cross-function communication. The main reason is that storage queues are cheaper and much easier to provision than other storage options.

Individual messages in a storage queue are limited in size to 64 KB. If you need to pass larger messages between functions, an Azure Service Bus queue could be used to support message sizes up to 256 KB in the Standard tier, and up to 100 MB in the Premium tier.

Service Bus topics are useful if you require message filtering before processing.

Event hubs are useful to support high volume communications.

## Write functions to be stateless

Functions should be stateless and idempotent if possible. Associate any required state information with your data. For example, an order being processed would likely have an associated `state`

member. A function could process an order based on that state while the function itself remains stateless.

Idempotent functions are especially recommended with timer triggers. For example, if you have something that absolutely must run once a day, write it so it can run anytime during the day with the same results. The function can exit when there's no work for a particular day. Also if a previous run failed to complete, the next run should pick up where it left off. This is particularly important for message-based bindings that retry on failure. For more information, see [Designing Azure Functions for identical input](functions-idempotent).

## Write defensive functions

Assume your function could encounter an exception at any time. Design your functions with the ability to continue from a previous fail point during the next execution. Consider a scenario that requires the following actions:

- Query for 10,000 rows in a database.
- Create a queue message for each of those rows to process further down the line.

Depending on how complex your system is, you may have: involved downstream services behaving badly, networking outages, or quota limits reached, etc. All of these can affect your function at any time. You need to design your functions to be prepared for it.

How does your code react if a failure occurs after inserting 5,000 of those items into a queue for processing? Track items in a set that you’ve completed. Otherwise, you might insert them again next time. This double-insertion can have a serious impact on your work flow, so [make your functions idempotent](functions-idempotent).

If a queue item was already processed, allow your function to be a no-op.

Take advantage of defensive measures already provided for components you use in the Azure Functions platform. For example, see **Handling poison queue messages** in the documentation for [Azure Storage Queue triggers and bindings](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#poison-messages).

For HTTP based functions consider [API versioning strategies](/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/serverless/web-app#api-versioning) with Azure API Management. For example, if you have to update your HTTP based function app, deploy the new update to a separate function app and use API Management revisions or versions to direct clients to the new version or revision. Once all clients are using the version or revision and no more executions are left on the previous function app, you can deprovision the previous function app.

## Function organization best practices

As part of your solution, you may develop and publish multiple functions. These functions are often combined into a single function app, but they can also run in separate function apps. In Premium and dedicated (App Service) hosting plans, multiple function apps can also share the same resources by running in the same plan. How you group your functions and function apps can impact the performance, scaling, configuration, deployment, and security of your overall solution. There aren't rules that apply to every scenario, so consider the information in this section when planning and developing your functions.

### Organize functions for performance and scaling

Each function that you create has a memory footprint. While this footprint is usually small, having too many functions within a function app can lead to slower startup of your app on new instances. It also means that the overall memory usage of your function app might be higher. It's hard to say how many functions should be in a single app, which depends on your particular workload. However, if your function stores a lot of data in memory, consider having fewer functions in a single app.

If you run multiple function apps in a single Premium plan or dedicated (App Service) plan, these apps are all sharing the same resources allocated to the plan. If you have one function app that has a much higher memory requirement than the others, it uses a disproportionate amount of memory resources on each instance to which the app is deployed. Because this could leave less memory available for the other apps on each instance, you might want to run a high-memory-using function app like this in its own separate hosting plan.

Note

When using the [Consumption plan](functions-scale), we recommend you always put each app in its own plan, since apps are scaled independently anyway. For more information, see [Multiple apps in the same plan](consumption-plan#multiple-apps-in-the-same-plan).

Consider whether you want to group functions with different load profiles. For example, if you have a function that processes many thousands of queue messages, and another that is only called occasionally but has high memory requirements, you might want to deploy them in separate function apps so they get their own sets of resources and they scale independently of each other.

### Organize functions for configuration and deployment

Function apps have a `host.json`

file, which is used to configure advanced behavior of function triggers and the Azure Functions runtime. Changes to the `host.json`

file apply to all functions within the app. If you have some functions that need custom configurations, consider moving them into their own function app.

All functions in your local project are deployed together as a set of files to your function app in Azure. You might need to deploy individual functions separately or use features like [deployment slots](functions-deployment-slots) for some functions and not others. In such cases, you should deploy these functions (in separate code projects) to different function apps.

### Organize functions by privilege

Connection strings and other credentials stored in application settings gives all of the functions in the function app the same set of permissions in the associated resource. Consider minimizing the number of functions with access to specific credentials by moving functions that don't use those credentials to a separate function app. You can always use techniques such as [function chaining](/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/) to pass data between functions in different function apps.

## Scalability best practices

There are a number of factors that impact how instances of your function app scale. The details are provided in the documentation for [function scaling](functions-scale). The following are some best practices to ensure optimal scalability of a function app.

### Share and manage connections

Reuse connections to external resources whenever possible. See [how to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

### Avoid sharing storage accounts

When you create a function app, you must associate it with a storage account. The storage account connection is maintained in the [AzureWebJobsStorage application setting](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage).

To maximize performance, use a separate storage account for each function app. This approach is particularly important when you have Durable Functions or Event Hubs triggered functions, which both generate a high volume of storage transactions. When your application logic interacts with Azure Storage, either directly (using the Storage SDK) or through one of the storage bindings, you should use a dedicated storage account. For example, if you have an event hub-triggered function writing some data to blob storage, use two storage accounts: one for the function app and another for the blobs that the function stores.

### Don't mix test and production code in the same function app

Functions within a function app share resources. For example, memory is shared. If you're using a function app in production, don't add test-related functions and resources to it. It can cause unexpected overhead during production code execution.

Be careful what you load in your production function apps. Memory is averaged across each function in the app.

If you have a shared assembly referenced in multiple .NET functions, put it in a common shared folder. Otherwise, you could accidentally deploy multiple versions of the same binary that behave differently between functions.

Don't use verbose logging in production code, which has a negative performance impact.

### Use async code but avoid blocking calls

Asynchronous programming is a recommended best practice, especially when blocking I/O operations are involved.

In C#, always avoid referencing the `Result`

property or calling `Wait`

method on a `Task`

instance. This approach can lead to thread exhaustion.

Tip

If you plan to use the HTTP or WebHook bindings, plan to avoid port exhaustion that can be caused by improper instantiation of `HttpClient`

. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

### Use multiple worker processes

By default, any host instance for Functions uses a single worker process. To improve performance, especially with single-threaded runtimes like Python, use the [FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_process_count) to increase the number of worker processes per host (up to 10). Azure Functions then tries to evenly distribute simultaneous function invocations across these workers.

The FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT applies to each host that Functions creates when scaling out your application to meet demand.

### Receive messages in batch whenever possible

Some triggers like Event Hub enable receiving a batch of messages on a single invocation. Batching messages has much better performance. You can configure the max batch size in the `host.json`

file as detailed in the [host.json reference documentation](functions-host-json)

For C# functions, you can change the type to a strongly-typed array. For example, instead of `EventData sensorEvent`

the method signature could be `EventData[] sensorEvent`

. For other languages, you'll need to explicitly set the cardinality property in your `function.json`

to `many`

in order to enable batching [as shown here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-templates/blob/df94e19484fea88fc2c68d9f032c9d18d860d5b5/Functions.Templates/Templates/EventHubTrigger-JavaScript/function.json#L10).

### Configure host behaviors to better handle concurrency

The `host.json`

file in the function app allows for configuration of host runtime and trigger behaviors. In addition to batching behaviors, you can manage concurrency for a number of triggers. Often adjusting the values in these options can help each instance scale appropriately for the demands of the invoked functions.

Settings in the host.json file apply across all functions within the app, within a *single instance* of the function. For example, if you had a function app with two HTTP functions and [ maxConcurrentRequests](functions-bindings-http-webhook#hostjson-settings) requests set to 25, a request to either HTTP trigger would count towards the shared 25 concurrent requests. When that function app is scaled to 10 instances, the ten functions effectively allow 250 concurrent requests (10 instances * 25 concurrent requests per instance).

Other host configuration options are found in the [host.json configuration article](functions-host-json).

Redis features [publish/subscribe functionality](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/pubsub/) that enables messages to be sent to Redis and broadcast to subscribers.

For more information about Azure Cache for Redis triggers and bindings, [Redis Extension for Azure Functions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-redis-extension/tree/main).

## Scope of availability for functions triggers

| Trigger Type | Azure Managed Redis | Azure Cache for Redis |
|---|---|---|
| Pub/Sub Trigger | Yes | Yes |

Important

When using Azure Managed Redis or the Enterprise tiers of Azure Cache for Redis, use port 10000 rather than port 6380 or 6379.

Warning

This trigger isn't supported on a [Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan) or a [Flex Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan) plan because Redis PubSub requires clients to always be actively listening to receive all messages. For consumption plans, your function might miss certain messages published to the channel.

Important

The Node.js v4 model for Functions isn't yet supported by the Azure Cache for Redis extension. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Important

The Python v2 model for Functions isn't yet supported by the Azure Cache for Redis extension. For more details about how the v2 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators).

## Examples

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).Important

For .NET functions, using the *isolated worker* model is recommended over the *in-process* model. For a comparison of the *in-process* and *isolated worker* models, see differences between the *isolated worker* model and the *in-process* model for .NET on Azure Functions.

The name of the
`<cacheName>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password...` |

`channel`

## Configuration

| function.json property | Description | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
`type` |
Trigger type. For the pub sub trigger, the type is `redisPubSubTrigger` . |

`pattern`

is true, then the channel is treated like a *glob-style*pattern instead of as a literal.`name`

`direction`

`in`

.Important

The `connection`

parameter does not hold the Redis cache connection string itself. Instead, it points to the name of the environment variable that holds the connection string. This makes the application more secure. For more information, see [Redis connection string](functions-bindings-cache#redis-connection-string).

## Usage

Redis features [publish/subscribe functionality](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/pubsub/) that enables messages to be sent to Redis and broadcast to subscribers. The `RedisPubSubTrigger`

enables Azure Functions to be triggered on pub/sub activity. The `RedisPubSubTrigger`

subscribes to a specific channel pattern using [ PSUBSCRIBE](https://redis.io/commands/psubscribe/), and surfaces messages received on those channels to the function.

### Prerequisites and limitations

- The
`RedisPubSubTrigger`

isn't capable of listening to[keyspace notifications](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications/)on clustered caches. - Basic tier functions don't support triggering on
`keyspace`

or`keyevent`

notifications through the`RedisPubSubTrigger`

. - The
`RedisPubSubTrigger`

isn't supported on a[Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan)or a[Flex Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan)because Redis PubSub requires clients to always be actively listening to receive all messages. For consumption plans, your function might miss certain messages published to the channel. - Functions with the
`RedisPubSubTrigger`

shouldn't be scaled out to multiple instances. Each instance listens and processes each pub sub message, resulting in duplicate processing.

Warning

This trigger isn't supported on a [Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan) or a [Flex Consumption plan](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan) because Redis PubSub requires clients to always be actively listening to receive all messages. For consumption plans, your function might miss certain messages published to the channel.

## Triggering on keyspace notifications

Redis offers a built-in concept called [keyspace notifications](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications/). When enabled, this feature publishes notifications of a wide range of cache actions to a dedicated pub/sub channel. Supported actions include actions that affect specific keys, called *keyspace notifications*, and specific commands, called *keyevent notifications*. A huge range of Redis actions are supported, such as `SET`

, `DEL`

, and `EXPIRE`

. The full list can be found in the [keyspace notification documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/pubsub/keyspace-notifications/).

The `keyspace`

and `keyevent`

notifications are published with the following syntax:

```
PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:<affectedKey> <command>
PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:<affectedCommand> <key>
```


Because these events are published on pub/sub channels, the `RedisPubSubTrigger`

is able to pick them up. See the [RedisPubSubTrigger](functions-bindings-cache-trigger-redispubsub) section for more examples.

Important

In Azure Cache for Redis, `keyspace`

events must be enabled before notifications are published. For more information, see [Advanced Settings](/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-configure#keyspace-notifications-advanced-settings).
