# IP addresses in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains the following concepts related to IP addresses of function apps:

- Locating the IP addresses currently in use by a function app.
- Conditions that cause function app IP addresses to change.
- Restricting the IP addresses that can access a function app.
- Defining dedicated IP addresses for a function app.

IP addresses are associated with function apps, not with individual functions. Incoming HTTP requests can't use the inbound IP address to call individual functions; they must use the default domain name (functionappname.azurewebsites.net) or a custom domain name.

## Function app inbound IP address

Each function app starts out by using a single inbound IP address. When a function app runs in a Consumption or Premium plan, more inbound IP addresses might be added as event-driven scale-out occurs. To find the inbound IP address or addresses being used by your app, use the `nslookup`

utility from your local computer, as in the following example:

```
nslookup <APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net
```


In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`

with your function app name. If your app uses a [custom domain name](../app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain), use `nslookup`

for that custom domain name instead.

## Function app outbound IP addresses

Each function app has a set of available outbound IP addresses. Any outbound connection from a function, such as to a back-end database, uses one of the available outbound IP addresses as the origin IP address. You can't know beforehand which IP address a given connection uses. For this reason, your back-end service must open its firewall to all of the function app's outbound IP addresses.

Tip

For some platform-level features such as [Key Vault references](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references), the origin IP might not be one of the outbound IPs, and you shouldn't configure the target resource to rely on these specific addresses. We recommend that the app instead uses a virtual network integration, because the platform routes traffic to the target resource through that network.

To find the outbound IP addresses available to a function app:

- Sign in to the
[Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com). - Select
**subscriptions**> {your subscription} >**providers**>**Microsoft.Web**>**sites**. - In the JSON panel, find the site with an
`id`

property that ends in the name of your function app. - See
`outboundIpAddresses`

and`possibleOutboundIpAddresses`

.

The set of `outboundIpAddresses`

is currently available to the function app. The set of `possibleOutboundIpAddresses`

includes IP addresses that are available only if the function app [scales to other pricing tiers](#outbound-ip-address-changes).

Note

When a function app that runs on the [Consumption plan](consumption-plan) or the [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) is scaled, a new range of outbound IP addresses might be assigned. When running on either of these plans, you can't rely on the reported outbound IP addresses to create a definitive allowlist. To be able to include all potential outbound addresses used during dynamic scaling, you need to add the entire data center to your allowlist.

## Data center outbound IP addresses

If you need to add the outbound IP addresses used by your function apps to an allowlist, another option is to add the function apps' data center (Azure region) to an allowlist. You can [download a JSON file that lists IP addresses for all Azure data centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519). Then find the JSON fragment that applies to the region that your function app runs in.

For example, the following JSON fragment is what the allowlist for Western Europe might look like:

```
{
"name": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
"id": "AzureCloud.westeurope",
"properties": {
"changeNumber": 9,
"region": "westeurope",
"platform": "Azure",
"systemService": "",
"addressPrefixes": [
"13.69.0.0/17",
"13.73.128.0/18",
... Some IP addresses not shown here
"213.199.180.192/27",
"213.199.183.0/24"
]
}
}
```


For information about when this file is updated and when the IP addresses change, expand the **Details** section of the [Download Center page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519).

## Inbound IP address changes

The inbound IP address **might** change when you:

- Delete a function app and recreate it in a different resource group.
- Delete the last function app in a resource group and region combination, and re-create it.
- Delete a TLS binding, such as during
[certificate renewal](../app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#renew-an-expiring-certificate).

When your function app runs in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan) or in a [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan), the inbound IP address might also change even when you haven't taken any actions such as the ones here.

## Outbound IP address changes

The relative stability of the outbound IP address depends on the hosting plan.

### Consumption and Premium plans

Because of autoscaling behaviors, the outbound IP can change at any time when running on a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan) or in a [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan).

If you need to control the outbound IP address of your function app, such as when you need to add it to an allowlist, consider implementing a [virtual network NAT gateway](#virtual-network-nat-gateway-for-outbound-static-ip) while running in a Premium hosting plan. You can also do this by running in a Dedicated (App Service) plan.

### Dedicated plans

When a function app runs on Dedicated (App Service) plans, the set of available outbound IP addresses for a function app might change when you:

- Take any action that can change the inbound IP address.
- Change your Dedicated (App Service) plan pricing tier. The list of all possible outbound IP addresses your app can use, for all pricing tiers, is in the
`possibleOutboundIPAddresses`

property. See[Find outbound IPs](#find-outbound-ip-addresses).

#### Forcing an outbound IP address change

Use the following procedure to deliberately force an outbound IP address change in a Dedicated (App Service) plan:

Scale your App Service plan up or down between Standard and Premium v2 pricing tiers.

Wait 10 minutes.

Scale back to where you started.


## IP address restrictions

You can configure a list of IP addresses that you want to allow or deny access to a function app. For more information, see [Azure App Service access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions).

## Dedicated IP addresses

There are several strategies to explore when your function app requires static, dedicated IP addresses.

### Virtual network NAT gateway for outbound static IP

You can control the IP address of outbound traffic from your functions by using a virtual network NAT gateway to direct traffic through a static public IP address. You can use this topology when running in a [Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) or in a [Dedicated hosting plan](dedicated-plan). To learn more, see [Tutorial: Control Azure Functions outbound IP with an Azure virtual network NAT gateway](functions-how-to-use-nat-gateway).

### App Service Environments

For full control over the IP addresses, both inbound and outbound, we recommend [App Service Environments](../app-service/environment/intro) (the [Isolated tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) of App Service plans). For more information, see [App Service Environment overview](../app-service/environment/overview).

To find out if your function app runs in an App Service Environment:

- Sign in to the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). - Navigate to the function app.
- Select the
**Overview**tab. - The App Service plan tier appears under
**App Service plan/pricing tier**. The App Service Environment pricing tier is**Isolated**.

The App Service Environment `sku`

is `Isolated`

.

## Next steps

A common cause of IP changes is function app scale changes. [Learn more about function app scaling](functions-scale).

# Differences between the isolated worker model and the in-process model for .NET on Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

There are two execution models for .NET functions:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This article describes the current state of the functional and behavioral differences between the two models. To migrate from the in-process model to the isolated worker model, see [Migrate .NET apps from the in-process model to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

- Cold start times could be additionally affected on Windows when using some preview versions of .NET due to just-in-time loading of preview frameworks. This impact applies to both the in-process and isolated worker models but can be noticeable when comparing across different versions. This delay for preview versions isn't present on Linux plans.

[Azure SDK for .NET](/en-us/dotnet/azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet)such as[BlobClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobclient). - ASP.NET Core types aren't supported for .NET Framework.

## Supported versions

Versions of the Functions runtime support specific versions of .NET. To learn more about Functions versions, see [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions). Version support also depends on whether your functions run in-process or isolated worker process.

Note

To learn how to change the Functions runtime version used by your function app, see [view and update the current runtime version](set-runtime-version#view-the-current-runtime-version).

The following table shows the highest level of .NET or .NET Framework that can be used with a specific version of Functions.

3 Support ends for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4).

4 Support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026. For more information, see [this support announcement](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). For continued full support, you should [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model).

5 You can't run .NET 10 apps on Linux in the Consumption plan. To run on Linux, you should instead use the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). For step-by-step migration instructions, see [Migrate Consumption plan apps to the Flex Consumption plan](migration/migrate-plan-consumption-to-flex?pivots=platform-linux).

# Quickstart: Build a scalable web API using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you use Azure Developer command-line tools to build a scalable web API with function endpoints that respond to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to a new serverless function app you create running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project source uses the Azure Developer CLI (azd) to simplify deploying your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

By default, the Flex Consumption plan follows a *pay-for-what-you-use* billing model, which means completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

[Java 17 Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)- If you use another
[supported version of Java](supported-languages?pivots=programming-language-java#languages-by-runtime-version), you must update the project's pom.xml file. - The
`JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

- If you use another
[Apache Maven 3.8.x](https://maven.apache.org)

- A
[secure HTTP test tool](functions-develop-local#http-test-tools)for sending requests with JSON payloads to your function endpoints. This article uses`curl`

.

## Initialize the project

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-javascript-azd)and initializes the project in the root folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the root folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-powershell-azd -e httpendpoint-ps`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "powershell", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME_VERSION": "7.2" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-typescript-azd -e httpendpoint-ts`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd)and initializes the project in the root folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name is also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the root folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-python-http-azd -e httpendpoint-py`

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In the root folder, run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python doesn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


## Run in your local environment

Run this command from your app folder in a terminal or command prompt:

`func start`

`mvn clean package mvn azure-functions:run`

`npm install func start`

`npm install npm start`

When the Functions host starts in your local project folder, it writes the URL endpoints of your HTTP triggered functions to the terminal output.

Note

Because access key authorization isn't enforced when running locally, the function URL returned doesn't include the access key value and you don't need it to call your function.

In your browser, go to the

`httpget`

endpoint, which should look like this URL:From a new terminal or command prompt window, run this

`curl`

command to send a POST request with a JSON payload to the`httppost`

endpoint:`curl -i http://localhost:7071/api/httppost -H "Content-Type: text/json" -d @testdata.json`

`curl -i http://localhost:7071/api/httppost -H "Content-Type: text/json" -d "@src/functions/testdata.json"`

This command reads JSON payload data from the

`testdata.json`

project file. You can find examples of both HTTP requests in the`test.http`

project file.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

- Run
`deactivate`

to shut down the virtual environment.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the two HTTP trigger function endpoints:

```
[Function("httpget")]
public IActionResult Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")]
HttpRequest req,
string name)
{
var returnValue = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
? "Hello, World."
: $"Hello, {name}.";
_logger.LogInformation($"C# HTTP trigger function processed a request for {returnValue}.");
return new OkObjectResult(returnValue);
}
```


```
@FunctionName("httpget")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
// Parse query parameter
String name = Optional.ofNullable(request.getQueryParameters().get("name")).orElse("World");
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
```


```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpget', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'function',
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || await request.text() || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
});
```


```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext } from "@azure/functions";
export async function httpGetFunction(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || await request.text() || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
};
app.http('httpget', {
methods: ['GET'],
authLevel: 'function',
handler: httpGetFunction
});
```


This `function.json`

file defines the `httpget`

function:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get"
],
"route": "httpget"
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
}
]
}
```


This `run.ps1`

file implements the function code:

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters
$name = $Request.Query.name
$body = "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response."
if ($name) {
$body = "Hello, $name. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
}
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
Body = $body
})
```


```
@app.route(route="httpget", methods=["GET"])
def http_get(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
name = req.params.get("name", "World")
logging.info(f"Processing GET request. Name: {name}")
return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

After you verify your functions locally, it's time to publish them to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

This project is configured to use the `azd up`

command to deploy this project to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure.

Tip

The project includes a set of Bicep files (in the `infra`

folder) that `azd`

uses to create a secure deployment to a Flex consumption plan that follows best practices.

Run this command to have

`azd`

create the required Azure resources in Azure and deploy your code project to the new function app:`azd up`

The root folder contains the

`azure.yaml`

definition file required by`azd`

.If you're not already signed in, you're asked to authenticate with your Azure account.

When prompted, provide these required deployment parameters:

Parameter Description *Azure subscription*Subscription in which your resources are created. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. *vnetEnabled*Choose *False*. When set to*True*the deployment creates your function app in a new virtual network.The

`azd up`

command uses your responses to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to complete these deployment tasks:Create and configure these required Azure resources (equivalent to

`azd provision`

):- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Storage (required) and Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Service-to-service connections using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)
- (Option) Virtual network to securely run both the function app and the other Azure resources

Package and deploy your code to the deployment container (equivalent to

`azd deploy`

). The app is then started and runs in the deployed package.

After the command completes successfully, you see links to the resources you created.


## Invoke the function on Azure

You can now invoke your function endpoints in Azure by making HTTP requests to their URLs by using your HTTP test tool or from the browser (for GET requests). When your functions run in Azure, access key authorization is enforced, and you must provide a function access key with your request.

You can use the Core Tools to get the URL endpoints of your functions running in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run these commands to get the URL endpoint values:

`$APP_NAME = azd env get-value AZURE_FUNCTION_NAME func azure functionapp list-functions $APP_NAME --show-keys`

The

`azd env get-value`

command gets your function app name from the local environment. When you use the`--show-keys`

option with`func azure functionapp list-functions`

, the returned**Invoke URL:**value for each endpoint includes a function-level access key.As before, use your HTTP test tool to validate these URLs in your function app running in Azure.


## Redeploy your code

Run the `azd up`

command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that you used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

# Quickstart: Host servers built with MCP SDKs on Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you learn how to host on Azure Functions Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that you create by using official MCP SDKs. Flex Consumption plan hosting lets you take advantage of Azure Functions' serverless scale, pay-for-what-you-use billing model, and built-in security features. It's perfect for MCP servers that use the streamable-http transport.

This article uses a sample MCP server project built by using official MCP SDKs.

Tip

Functions also provides an MCP extension that enables you to create MCP servers by using Azure Functions programming model. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build a custom remote MCP server using Azure Functions](scenario-custom-remote-mcp-server).

Because the new server runs in a Flex Consumption plan, which follows a *pay-for-what-you-use* billing model, completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few cents or less in your Azure account.

Important

While [hosting your MCP servers using Custom Handlers](self-hosted-mcp-servers) is supported for all languages, this quickstart scenario currently only has examples for C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete this quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/)or above

[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/)or above[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)for Python package management

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)with these extensions:[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)v4.5.0 or above and attempts to install it when not available.

[Azure Developer CLI](/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)v1.17.2 or above[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can also run Azure CLI commands in[Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview).An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

Note

This sample requires that you have permission to create a [Microsoft Entra app](https://docs.azure.cn/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra) in the Azure subscription you use.

## Get started with a sample project

The easiest way to get started is to clone an MCP server sample project built with official MCP SDKs:

- In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace where you want to create your project.

In the Terminal, run this command to initialize the .NET sample:

`azd init --template mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-dotnet -e mcpsdkserver-dotnet`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-dotnet)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

In the Terminal, run this command to initialize the TypeScript sample:

`azd init --template mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-node -e mcpsdkserver-node`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-node)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

In the Terminal, run this command to initialize the Python sample:

`azd init --template mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-python -e mcpsdkserver-python`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-java)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also used in names of the resources you create in Azure.

The code project template is for an MCP server with tools that access public weather APIs.

## Run the MCP server locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer.

- Open Terminal in the editor (
`Ctrl+Shift+``

)

- In the root directory, run
`func start`

to start the server. The**Terminal**panel displays the output from Core Tools.

- In the root directory, run
`npm install`

to install dependencies, then run`npm run build`

. - To start the server, run
`func start`

.

- In the root directory, run
`uv run func start`

to create virtual environment, install dependencies, and start the server.

## Test server by using GitHub Copilot

To verify your server by using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

Open the

`mcp.json`

file in the`.vscode`

directory.Start the server by selecting the

**Start**button above the`local-mcp-server`

configuration.In the Copilot

**Chat**window, make sure that the**Agent**model is selected, select the**Configure tools**icon, and verify that`MCP Server:local-mcp-server`

is enabled in the chat.Run this prompt in chat:

`Return the weather forecast for New York City using #local-mcp-server`

Copilot should call one of the weather tools to help answer this question. When prompted to run the tool, select

**Allow in this Workspace**so you don't have to keep regranting this permission.

After you verify the tool functionality locally, you can stop the server and deploy the project code to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

This project is configured to use the `azd up`

command to deploy this project to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure. The project includes a set of Bicep files that `azd`

uses to create a secure deployment that follows best practices.

Sign in to Azure:

`azd login`

Configure Visual Studio Code as a preauthorized client application:

`azd env set PRE_AUTHORIZED_CLIENT_IDS aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56`

A preauthorized application can authenticate to and access your MCP server without requiring more consent prompts.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Package, Provision and Deploy (up)`

. Then, sign in by using your Azure account.When prompted, provide these required deployment parameters:

Parameter Description *Azure subscription*Subscription in which your resources are created. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. After the command completes successfully, you see links to the resources you created and the endpoint for your deployed MCP server. Make a note of your function app name, which you need for the next section.

Tip

If an error occurs when running the

`azd up`

command, just rerun the command. You can run`azd up`

repeatedly because it skips creating any resources that already exist. You can also call`azd up`

again when deploying updates to your service.

## Connect to the remote MCP server

Your MCP server is now running in Azure. To connect GitHub Copilot to your remote server, configure it in your workspace settings.

In the

`mcp.json`

file, switch to the remote server by selecting**Stop**for the`local-mcp-server`

configuration and**Start**on the`remote-mcp-server`

configuration.When prompted for

**The domain of the function app**, enter the name of your function app you noted in the previous section. When prompted to authenticate to Microsoft, select**Allow**then choose your Azure account.Verify the remote server by asking a question like:

`Return the weather forecast for Seattle using #remote-mcp-server.`

Copilot calls one of the weather tools to answer the query.


Tip

You can see output of a server by selecting **More...** > **Show Output**. The output provides useful information about possible connection failures. You can also select the gear icon to change log levels to **Traces** to get more details on the interactions between the client (Visual Studio Code) and the server.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the MCP server:

The MCP server code is defined in the project root. The server uses the official C# MCP SDK to define these weather-related tools:

```

# Azure Event Hubs output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) bindings for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and output bindings for Event Hubs.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Use the Event Hubs output binding to write events to an event stream. You must have send permission to an event hub to write events to it.

Make sure the required package references are in place before you try to implement an output binding.

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that writes a message string to an event hub, using the method return value as the output:

```
[Function(nameof(EventHubFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
[EventHubOutput("dest", Connection = "EventHubConnection")]
public string EventHubFunction(
[EventHubTrigger("src", Connection = "EventHubConnection")] string[] input,
FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation("First Event Hubs triggered message: {msg}", input[0]);
var message = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return message;
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that sends a single message to an event hub:

```
import { app, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.eventHub({
eventHubName: 'myeventhub',
connection: 'MyEventHubSendAppSetting',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that sends a single message to an event hub:

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const eventHubOutput = output.eventHub({
eventHubName: 'myeventhub',
connection: 'MyEventHubSendAppSetting',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: eventHubOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

The following example shows an event hub trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. The function writes a message to an event hub. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="eventhub_output")
@app.route(route="eventhub_output")
@app.event_hub_output(arg_name="event",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def eventhub_output(req: func.HttpRequest, event: func.Out[str]):
body = req.get_body()
if body is not None:
event.set(body.decode('utf-8'))
else:
logging.info('req body is none')
return 'ok'
```


Here's Python code that sends multiple messages:

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
from typing import List
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="eventhub_output")
@app.route(route="eventhub_output")
@app.event_hub_output(arg_name="event",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def eventhub_output(req: func.HttpRequest, event: func.Out[List[str]]) -> func.HttpResponse:
my_messages=["message1", "message2","message3"]
event.set(my_messages)
return func.HttpResponse(f"Messages sent")
```


The following example shows a Java function that writes a message containing the current time to an event hub.

```
@FunctionName("sendTime")
@EventHubOutput(name = "event", eventHubName = "samples-workitems", connection = "AzureEventHubConnection")
public String sendTime(
@TimerTrigger(name = "sendTimeTrigger", schedule = "0 */5 * * * *") String timerInfo) {
return LocalDateTime.now().toString();
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@EventHubOutput`

annotation on parameters whose value would be published to Event Hubs. The parameter should be of type `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is a POJO or any native Java type.

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to configure the binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#event-hubs-output).

Use the [EventHubOutputAttribute] to define an output binding to an event hub, which supports the following properties.

| Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
EventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, these properties are supported for `event_hub_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The variable name used in function code that represents the event. |
`event_hub_name` |
he name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [EventHubOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhuboutput) annotation on parameters whose value would be published to Event Hubs. The following settings are supported on the annotation:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.eventHub()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
eventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, which differs by runtime version.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `eventHub` . |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This parameter is set automatically when you create the binding in the Azure portal. |
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the event. |
eventHubName |
Functions 2.x and higher. The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. To learn more, see
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The parameter type supported by the Event Hubs output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

There are two options for outputting an Event Hubs message from a function by using the [EventHubOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhuboutput) annotation:

**Return value**: By applying the annotation to the function itself, the return value of the function is persisted as an Event Hubs message.**Imperative**: To explicitly set the message value, apply the annotation to a specific parameter of the type, where`OutputBinding<T>`

`T`

is a POJO or any native Java type. With this configuration, passing a value to the`setValue`

method persists the value as an Event Hubs message.

There are two options for outputting an Event Hubs message from a function:

**Return value**: Set the`name`

property in*function.json*to`$return`

. With this configuration, the function's return value is persisted as an Event Hubs message.**Imperative**: Pass a value to the[set](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out#set-val--t-----none)method of the parameter declared as an[Out](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out)type. The value passed to`set`

is persisted as an Event Hubs message.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[func.EventHubEvent]`

or `func.Out[List[func.EventHubEvent]]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Event Hubs. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

Obtain this connection string by clicking the **Connection Information** button for the [namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace), not the event hub itself. The connection string must be for an Event Hubs namespace, not the event hub itself.

When used for triggers, the connection string must have at least "read" permissions to activate the function. When used for output bindings, the connection string must have "send" permissions to send messages to the event stream.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-event-hubs?tabs=extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Event Hubs namespace. | `myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net` |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your event hub at runtime. The scope of the role assignment can be for an Event Hubs namespace, or the event hub itself. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Event Hubs extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.
