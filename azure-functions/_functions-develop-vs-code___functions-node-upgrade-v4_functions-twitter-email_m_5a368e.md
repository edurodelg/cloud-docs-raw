Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) lets you develop functions locally and deploy them to Azure. If this experience is your first with Azure Functions, you can learn more at [An introduction to Azure Functions](functions-overview).

The Azure Functions extension provides these benefits:

- Edit, build, and run functions on your local development computer.
- Publish your Azure Functions project directly to Azure.
- Write your functions in various languages while taking advantage of the benefits of Visual Studio Code.

Important

Don't mix local development and portal development for a single function app. When you publish from a local project to a function app, the deployment process overwrites any functions that you developed in the portal.

## Prerequisites

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)installed on one of the[supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). You can also install the[Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack), which is recommended for working with Azure resources.An active

[Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't yet have an account, you can create one from the extension in Visual Studio Code.

You also need these prerequisites to [run and debug your functions locally](#run-functions-locally). They're not required to just create or publish projects to Azure Functions.

- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local), which enables an integrated local debugging experience. When you have the Azure Functions extension installed, the easiest way to install or update Core Tools is by running the`Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools`

command from the command palette.

The

[C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)for Visual Studio Code.[.NET (CLI)](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), which is included in the .NET SDK.

[Java](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure), one of the[supported versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions).

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), one of the[supported versions](functions-reference-node#node-version). Use the`node --version`

command to check your version.

[PowerShell 7.2](/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows)recommended. For version information, see[PowerShell versions](functions-reference-powershell#powershell-versions).

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), one of the[supported versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions).[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)for Visual Studio Code.

## Create an Azure Functions project

The Functions extension lets you create the required function app project at the same time you create your first function. Use these steps to create an HTTP-triggered function in a new project. An [HTTP trigger](functions-bindings-http-webhook) is the simplest function trigger template to demonstrate.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

. Select the directory location for your project workspace, then choose**Select**.You can either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace, but don't choose a project folder that's already part of a workspace.

You can instead run the command

`Azure Functions: Create New Containerized Project...`

to also get a Dockerfile generated for the project.When prompted,

**Select a language**for your project. If necessary, choose a specific language version.Select the

**HTTP trigger**function template, or select**Skip for now**to create a project without a function. You can always[add a function to your project](#add-a-function-to-your-project)later.Tip

To view additional templates, select the

**Change template filter**option and set the value to**Core**or**All**.For the function name, enter

**HttpExample**, select Enter, then select**Function**authorization.This authorization level requires that you provide a

[function key](function-keys-how-to)when you call the function endpoint.From the dropdown list, select

**Add to workspace**.In the

**Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?**window, select**Yes**.

Visual Studio Code creates a function in your chosen language and in the template for an HTTP-triggered function.

### Generated project files

The project template creates a project in your chosen language and installs the required dependencies. For any language, the new project has these files:

**host.json**: Lets you configure the Functions host. These settings apply when you're running functions locally and when you're running them in Azure. For more information, see[host.json reference](functions-host-json).**local.settings.json**: Maintains settings used when you're locally running functions. These settings are used only when you're running functions locally. For more information, see[Local settings file](#local-settings).Important

Because the

**local.settings.json**file can contain secrets, make sure to exclude the file from your project source control.**Dockerfile**(optional): Lets you create a containerized function app from your project by using an approved base image for your project. You only get this file when you run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Containerized Project...`

. You can add a Dockerfile to an existing project by using the`func init --docker-only`

command in[Core Tools](functions-core-tools-reference#func-init).

An HttpExample.cs class library file, the contents of which vary depending on whether your project runs in an [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#project-structure) or [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library#functions-class-library-project) with the Functions host.

These files are created:

A pom.xml file in the root folder that defines the project and deployment parameters, including project dependencies and the

[Java version](functions-reference-java#java-versions). The pom.xml also contains information about the Azure resources that are created during a deployment.A

[Functions.java file](functions-reference-java#triggers-and-annotations)in your src path that implements the function.

Files generated depend on the chosen Node.js programming model for Functions:

An HttpExample folder is created that contains:

- The
[function.json definition file](functions-reference-powershell#folder-structure) - A run.ps1 file, which contains the function code.

Files generated depend on the chosen Python programming model for Functions:

At this point, you can [run your HTTP trigger function locally](#run-functions-locally).

## Add a function to your project

You can add a new function to an existing project by using one of the predefined Functions trigger templates. To add a new function trigger, select F1 to open the command palette, then find and run the command **Azure Functions: Create Function**. Follow the prompts to choose your trigger type and define the required attributes of the trigger. If your trigger requires an access key or connection string to connect to a service, get that item ready before you create the function trigger.

This action adds a new C# class library (.cs) file to your project.

This action adds a new Java (.java) file to your project.

This action's results depend on the Node.js model version.

This action creates a new folder in the project. The folder contains a new **function.json** file and the new PowerShell code file.

This action's results depends on the Python model version.

## Connect to services

You can connect your function to other Azure services by adding input and output bindings. Bindings connect your function to other services without you having to write the connection code.

For example, the way that you define an output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your process model:

If necessary,

[add a reference to the package that supports your binding extension](#install-binding-extensions).Update the function method to add an attribute that defines the binding parameter, like

`QueueOutput`

for a queue output binding. You can use a`MultiResponse`

object to return multiple messages or multiple output streams.

For example, to add an output binding that writes data to a storage queue, update the function method to add a binding parameter defined by using the [ QueueOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.queueoutput) annotation. The

[object represents the messages that are written to an output binding when the function completes.](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding)

`OutputBinding<T>`

For example, the way that you define the output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your Node.js model version:

Visual Studio Code lets you add bindings to your function.json file by following a convenient set of prompts.

To add a binding, open the command pallet (F1) and type **Azure Functions: add binding...**, choose the function for the new binding, and then follow the prompts, which vary depending on the type of binding being added to the function.

The following are example prompts to define a new storage output binding:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
Select binding direction |
`out` |
The binding is an output binding. |
Select binding with direction |
`Azure Queue Storage` |
The binding is an Azure Storage queue binding. |
The name used to identify this binding in your code |
`msg` |
Name that identifies the binding parameter referenced in your code. |
The queue to which the message will be sent |
`outqueue` |
The name of the queue that the binding writes to. When the queueName doesn't exist, the binding creates it on first use. |
Select setting from "local.settings.json" |
`MyStorageConnection` |
The name of an application setting that contains the connection string for the storage account. The `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting contains the connection string for the storage account you created with the function app. |

You can also right-click (Ctrl+click on macOS) directly on the **function.json** file in your function folder, select **Add binding**, and follow the same prompts.

In this example, the following binding is added to the `bindings`

array in your function.json file:

```
{
"type": "queue",
"direction": "out",
"name": "msg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection"
}
```


For example, the way you define the output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your Python model version:

The following example shows the function definition after adding a [Queue Storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output) to an [HTTP triggered function](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger):

Because an HTTP triggered function also returns an HTTP response, the function returns a `MultiResponse`

object, which represents both the HTTP and queue output.

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
```


This example is the definition of the `MultiResponse`

object that includes the output binding:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public IActionResult HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


When applying that example to your own project, you might need to change `HttpRequest`

to `HttpRequestData`

and `IActionResult`

to `HttpResponseData`

, depending on if you are using [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) or not.

Messages are sent to the queue when the function completes. The way you define the output binding depends on your process model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@FunctionName("HttpExample")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=java#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=javascript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=powershell#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@app.route(route="HttpExample")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
def HttpExample(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out [func.QueueMessage]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Python model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=python#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=typescript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create Azure resources

Before you can publish your Functions project to Azure, you must have a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription to run your code. The function app provides an execution context for your functions. When you publish from Visual Studio Code to a function app in Azure, the project is packaged and deployed to the selected function app in your Azure subscription.

When you create a function app in Azure, you can choose either a quick function app create path using defaults or a path that gives you advanced options, such as using existing Azure resources. This way, you have more control over creating the remote resources.

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Create an Azure Container Apps deployment

Important

A new hosting method for running Azure Functions directly in Azure Container Apps is now available. See [Native Azure Functions Support in Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039). This integration allows you to use the full features and capabilities of Azure Container Apps. You also benefit from the functions programming model and simplicity of autoscaling provided by Azure Functions.

We recommend this approach for most new workloads. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview).

Use Visual Studio Code to create Azure resources for a containerized code project. When the extension detects the presence of a Dockerfile during resource creation, it asks if you want to deploy the container image instead of just the code. Visual Studio Code creates an Azure Container Apps environment for your containerized code project that's integrated with Azure Functions. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

Note

Container deployment requires the [Azure Container Apps extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecontainerapps). This extension is currently in preview.

The create process depends on whether you choose a quick create or you need to use advanced options:

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure...`

.When prompted, choose

**Container image**.Provide the following information at the prompts:

Prompt Selection **Select subscription**(optional)Choose the subscription to use. You won't see this prompt when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a name for the new function app**Type a name that's valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's globally unique in Functions. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**so that your app connects to remote resources by using Microsoft Entra ID authentication instead of using shared secrets (connection strings and keys), which are less secure.**Select a location for new resources**For better performance, choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you.When prompted,

**Enter a name for the container app environment**.The extension shows the status of individual resources as they're being created in Azure in the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel.

For more information about the resources required to run your containerized functions in Container Apps, see [Required resources](functions-infrastructure-as-code?pivots=container-apps#required-resources).

Note

You can't currently use Visual Studio Code to deploy a containerized function app to an Azure Functions-integrated Container Apps environment. You must instead publish your container image to a container registry and then set that registry image as the deployment source for your Container Apps-hosted function app. For more information, see [Create your function app in a container](functions-how-to-custom-container#create-your-function-app-in-a-container) and [Update an image in the registry](functions-how-to-custom-container#update-an-image-in-the-registry).

## Deploy project files

Set up [continuous deployment](functions-continuous-deployment) so that your function app in Azure updates when you update source files in the connected source location. You can also deploy your project files from Visual Studio Code. When you publish from Visual Studio Code, you can take advantage of the [Zip deploy technology](functions-deployment-technologies#zip-deploy).

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Get the URL of an HTTP triggered function in Azure

To call an HTTP-triggered function from a client, you need the function's URL, which is available after deployment to your function app. This URL includes any required function keys. You can use the extension to get these URLs for your deployed functions. If you just want to run the remote function in Azure, [use the Execute function now](#run-functions-in-azure) functionality of the extension.

Select F1 to open the command palette, and then find and run the command

**Azure Functions: Copy Function URL**.Follow the prompts to select your function app in Azure and then the specific HTTP trigger that you want to invoke.


The function URL is copied to the clipboard, along with any required keys passed by the `code`

query parameter. Use an HTTP tool to submit POST requests, or a browser to submit GET requests to the remote function.

When the extension gets the URL of a function in Azure, it uses your Azure account to automatically retrieve the keys needed to start the function. [Learn more about function access keys](security-concepts#function-access-keys). Starting non-HTTP triggered functions requires using the admin key.

## Run functions

The Azure Functions extension lets you run individual functions. You can run functions either in your project on your local development computer or in your Azure subscription.

For HTTP trigger functions, the extension calls the HTTP endpoint. For other kinds of triggers, the extension calls administrator APIs to start the function. The message body of the request sent to the function depends on the trigger type. When a trigger requires test data, you're prompted to enter data in a specific JSON format.

### Run functions in Azure

To execute a function in Azure from Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

In the command palette, enter

**Azure Functions: Execute function now**, and select your Azure subscription.From the list, choose your function app in Azure. If you don't see your function app, make sure you're signed in to the correct subscription.

From the list, choose the function that you want to run. In

**Enter request body**, type the message body of the request, and press Enter to send this request message to your function.The default text in

**Enter request body**indicates the body's format. If your function app has no functions, a notification error is shown with this error.When the function executes in Azure and returns a response, Visual Studio Code shows a notification.


You can also run your function from the **Azure: Functions** area by opening the shortcut menu for the function that you want to run from your function app in your Azure subscription, and then selecting **Execute Function Now...**.

When you run your functions in Azure from Visual Studio Code, the extension uses your Azure account to automatically retrieve the keys needed to start the function. [Learn more about function access keys](security-concepts#function-access-keys). Starting non-HTTP triggered functions requires using the admin key.

### Run functions locally

The local runtime is the same runtime that hosts your function app in Azure. The runtime reads local settings from the [local.settings.json file](#local-settings). To run your Functions project locally, you must meet [more requirements](#prerequisites).

#### Configure the project to run locally

The Functions runtime uses an Azure Storage account internally for all trigger types except HTTP and webhooks. Set the **Values.AzureWebJobsStorage** key to a valid Azure Storage account connection string.

This section uses the [Azure Storage extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage) with [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/) to connect to and retrieve the storage connection string.

To set the storage account connection string:

In Visual Studio, open

**Cloud Explorer**, expand**Storage Account**>**Your Storage Account**, then select**Properties**and copy the**Primary Connection String**value.In your project, open the local.settings.json file and set the value of the

**AzureWebJobsStorage**key to the connection string you copied.Repeat the previous step to add unique keys to the

**Values**array for any other connections required by your functions.

For more information, see [Local settings file](#local-settings).

#### Debug functions locally

To debug your functions, select F5. If [Core Tools](functions-run-local) isn't available, you're prompted to install it. When Core Tools is installed and running, output is shown in the Terminal. This step is the same as running the `func start`

Core Tools command from the Terminal, but with extra build tasks and an attached debugger.

When the project is running, you can use the **Execute Function Now...** feature of the extension to trigger your functions as you would when the project is deployed to Azure. With the project running in debug mode, breakpoints are hit in Visual Studio Code as you would expect.

In the command palette, enter

**Azure Functions: Execute function now**and choose**Local project**.Choose the function you want to run in your project and type the message body of the request in

**Enter request body**. Press Enter to send this request message to your function. The default text in**Enter request body**should indicate the format of the body. If your function app has no functions, a notification error is shown with this error.When the function runs locally and after the response is received, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.

Keys aren't required when running locally. This rule applies to both function keys and admin-level keys.

## Work with app settings locally

When your function app runs in Azure, settings required by your functions are [stored encrypted in app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings). During local development, these settings are instead added to the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. The *local.settings.json* file also stores settings used by local development tools.

Items in the `Values`

collection in your project's *local.settings.json* file are intended to mirror items in your function app's [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) in Azure.

By default, these settings aren't migrated automatically when you publish the project to Azure. After publishing finishes, you can choose to publish settings from local.settings.json to your function app in Azure. To learn more, see [Publish application settings](#publish-application-settings).

Values in **ConnectionStrings** are never published.

Your code can read the function application settings values as environment variables. For more information, see [Environment variables](functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-java#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-powershell#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables).

## Application settings in Azure

The settings in the local.settings.json file in your project should match the application settings in the function app in Azure. You must add any new settings to both local.settings.json and the function app in Azure. These settings aren't uploaded automatically when you publish the project. Likewise, you must download any settings that you create in your function app [in the portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) to your local project.

### Publish application settings

The easiest way to publish the required settings to your function app in Azure is to use the **Upload settings** link that appears after you publish your project:


You can also publish settings by using the **Azure Functions: Upload Local Setting** command in the command palette. You can add individual settings to application settings in Azure by using the **Azure Functions: Add New Setting** command.

Tip

Be sure to save your local.settings.json file before you publish it.

If the local file is encrypted, the process decrypts it, publishes it, and encrypts it again. If conflicting values exist in the two locations, you're prompted to choose how to proceed.

View existing app settings in the **Azure: Functions** area by expanding your subscription, your function app, and **Application Settings**.


### Download settings from Azure

If you create application settings in Azure, you can download them into your local.settings.json file by using the **Azure Functions: Download Remote Settings** command.

As with uploading, if the local file is encrypted, the process decrypts it, updates it, and encrypts it again. If conflicting values exist in the two locations, you're prompted to choose how to proceed.

## Install binding extensions

Except for HTTP and timer triggers, bindings are implemented in extension packages.

You must explicitly install the extension packages for the triggers and bindings that need them. The specific package you install depends on your project's process model.

Run the [dotnet add package](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command in the Terminal window to install the extension packages that you need in your project. This template demonstrates how you add a binding for an [isolated-process class library](dotnet-isolated-process-guide):

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.<BINDING_TYPE_NAME> --version <TARGET_VERSION>
```


Replace `<BINDING_TYPE_NAME>`

with the name of the package that contains the binding you need. You can find the desired binding reference article in the [list of supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

Replace `<TARGET_VERSION>`

in the example with a specific version of the package, such as `3.0.0-beta5`

. Valid versions are listed on the individual package pages at [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The major versions that correspond to the current Functions runtime are specified in the reference article for the binding.

Tip

You can also use the **NuGet** commands in [the C# Dev Kit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/package-management#_add-a-package) to install binding extension packages.

C# script uses [extension bundles](extension-bundles).

The easiest way to install binding extensions is to enable [extension bundles](extension-bundles). When you enable bundles, a predefined set of extension packages is automatically installed.

To enable extension bundles, open the host.json file and update its contents to match the following code:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[3.*, 4.0.0)"
}
}
```


If for some reason you can't use an extension bundle to install binding extensions for your project, see [Explicitly install extensions](functions-bindings-register#explicitly-install-extensions).

## Monitoring functions

When you [run functions locally](#run-functions-locally), Core Tools streams log data to the Terminal console. You can also get log data when your Functions project runs in a function app in Azure. You can connect to streaming logs in Azure to see near-real-time log data. You should enable Application Insights for a more complete understanding of how your function app behaves.

### Streaming logs

When you're developing an application, it's often useful to see logging information in near-real time. You can view a stream of log files generated by your functions. Turn on logs from the command pallet with the `Azure Functions: Start streaming logs`

command. This output is an example of streaming logs for a request to an HTTP-triggered function:


To learn more, see [Streaming logs](functions-monitoring?tabs=vs-code#streaming-logs).

### Application Insights

You should monitor the execution of your functions by integrating your function app with Application Insights. When you create a function app in the Azure portal, this integration occurs by default. When you create your function app during Visual Studio publishing, you need to integrate Application Insights yourself. To learn how, see [Enable Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration).

To learn more about monitoring using Application Insights, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

## C# script projects

By default, all C# projects are created as [C# compiled class library projects](functions-dotnet-class-library). If you prefer to work with C# script projects instead, you must select C# script as the default language in the Azure Functions extension settings:

Select

**File**>**Preferences**>**Settings**.Go to

**User Settings**>**Extensions**>**Azure Functions**.Select

**C#Script**from**Azure Function: Project Language**.

After you complete these steps, calls made to the underlying Core Tools include the `--csx`

option, which generates and publishes C# script (.csx) project files. When you specify this default language, all projects that you create default to C# script projects. You're not prompted to choose a project language when a default is set. To create projects in other languages, you must change this setting or remove it from the user settings.json file. After you remove this setting, you're again prompted to choose your language when you create a project.

## Command palette reference

The Azure Functions extension provides a useful graphical interface for interacting with your function apps in Azure. The same functionality is also available as commands in the command palette (F1). These Azure Functions commands are available:

| Azure Functions command | Description |
|---|---|
Add New Settings |
Creates a new application setting in Azure. To learn more, see

# Migrate to version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article discusses the differences between version 3 and version 4 of the Node.js programming model and how to upgrade an existing v3 app. If you want to create a new v4 app instead of upgrading an existing v3 app, see the tutorial for either [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-javascript) or [Azure Functions Core Tools](how-to-create-function-vs-code?pivot=programming-language-javascript). This article uses "tip" alerts to highlight the most important concrete actions that you should take to upgrade your app.
Version 4 is designed to provide Node.js developers with the following benefits:

- Provide a familiar and intuitive experience to Node.js developers.
- Make the file structure flexible with support for full customization.
- Switch to a code-centric approach for defining function configuration.

## Considerations

- The Node.js programming model shouldn't be confused with the Azure Functions runtime:
**Programming model**: Defines how you author your code and is specific to JavaScript and TypeScript.**Runtime**: Defines underlying behavior of Azure Functions and is shared across all languages.

- The version of the programming model is strictly tied to the version of the
npm package. It's versioned independently of the`@azure/functions`

[runtime](functions-versions). Both the runtime and the programming model use the number 4 as their latest major version, but that's a coincidence. - You can't mix the v3 and v4 programming models in the same function app. As soon as you register one v4 function in your app, any v3 functions registered in
*function.json*files are ignored.

## Requirements

Version 4 of the Node.js programming model requires the following minimum versions:

npm package v4.0.0`@azure/functions`

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)v18+[Azure Functions Runtime](functions-versions)v4.25+[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)v4.0.5382+ (if running locally)

npm package v4.0.0`@azure/functions`

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)v18+[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)v4+[Azure Functions Runtime](functions-versions)v4.25+[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)v4.0.5382+ (if running locally)

## Include the npm package

In v4, the [ @azure/functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/functions) npm package contains the primary source code that backs the Node.js programming model. In previous versions, that code shipped directly in Azure and the npm package had only the TypeScript types. You now need to include this package for both TypeScript and JavaScript apps. You

*can*include the package for existing v3 apps, but it isn't required.

Tip

Make sure the `@azure/functions`

package is listed in the `dependencies`

section (not `devDependencies`

) of your *package.json* file. You can install v4 by using the following command:

```
npm install @azure/functions
```


## Set your app entry point

In v4 of the programming model, you can structure your code however you want. The only files that you need at the root of your app are *host.json* and *package.json*.

Otherwise, you define the file structure by setting the `main`

field in your *package.json* file. You can set the `main`

field to a single file or multiple files by using a [glob pattern](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). The following table shows example values for the `main`

field:

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
`src/index.js` |
Register functions from a single root file. |
`src/functions/*.js` |
Register each function from its own file. |
`src/{index.js,functions/*.js}` |
A combination where you register each function from its own file, but you still have a root file for general app-level code. |

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
`dist/src/index.js` |
Register functions from a single root file. |
`dist/src/functions/*.js` |
Register each function from its own file. |
`dist/src/{index.js,functions/*.js}` |
A combination where you register each function from its own file, but you still have a root file for general app-level code. |

Tip

Make sure you define a `main`

field in your *package.json* file.

## Switch the order of arguments

The trigger input, instead of the invocation context, is now the first argument to your function handler. The invocation context, now the second argument, is simplified in v4 and isn't as required as the trigger input. You can leave it off if you aren't using it.

Tip

Switch the order of your arguments. For example, if you're using an HTTP trigger, switch `(context, request)`

to either `(request, context)`

or just `(request)`

if you aren't using the context.

## Define your function in code

You no longer have to create and maintain those separate *function.json* configuration files. You can now fully define your functions directly in your TypeScript or JavaScript files. In addition, many properties now have defaults so that you don't have to specify them every time.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
},
});
```


```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


Tip

Move the configuration from your *function.json* file to your code. The type of the trigger corresponds to a method on the `app`

object in the new model. For example, if you use an `httpTrigger`

type in *function.json*, call `app.http()`

in your code to register the function. If you use `timerTrigger`

, call `app.timer()`

.

## Review your usage of context

In v4, the `context`

object is simplified to reduce duplication and to make writing unit tests easier. For example, we streamlined the primary input and output so that they're accessed only as the argument and return value of your function handler.

You can't access the primary input and output on the `context`

object anymore, but you must still access *secondary* inputs and outputs on the `context`

object. For more information about secondary inputs and outputs, see the [Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node#extra-inputs-and-outputs).

### Get the primary input as an argument

The primary input is also called the *trigger* and is the only required input or output. You must have one (and only one) trigger.

Version 4 supports only one way of getting the trigger input, as the first argument:

```
async function httpTrigger1(request, context) {
const onlyOption = request;
```


```
async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const onlyOption = request;
```


Tip

Make sure you aren't using `context.req`

or `context.bindings`

to get the input.

### Set the primary output as your return value

Version 4 supports only one way of setting the primary output, through the return value:

```
return {
body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
```


```
async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
// ...
return {
body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
}
```


Tip

Make sure you always return the output in your function handler, instead of setting it with the `context`

object.

### Context logging

In v4, logging methods were moved to the root `context`

object as shown in the following example. For more information about logging, see the [Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node#logging).

```
context.log('This is an info log');
context.error('This is an error');
context.warn('This is an error');
```


### Create a test context

Version 3 doesn't support creating an invocation context outside the Azure Functions runtime, so authoring unit tests can be difficult. Version 4 allows you to create an instance of the invocation context, although the information during tests isn't detailed unless you add it yourself.

```
const testInvocationContext = new InvocationContext({
functionName: 'testFunctionName',
invocationId: 'testInvocationId'
});
```


## Review your usage of HTTP types

The HTTP request and response types are now a subset of the [fetch standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch). They're no longer unique to Azure Functions.

The types use the [ undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/) package in Node.js. This package follows the fetch standard and is

[currently being integrated](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1737)into Node.js core.

### HttpRequest

*Body*. You can access the body by using a method specific to the type that you want to receive:`const body = await request.text(); const body = await request.json(); const body = await request.formData(); const body = await request.arrayBuffer(); const body = await request.blob();`

*Header*:`const header = request.headers.get('content-type');`

*Query parameter*:`const name = request.query.get('name');`


### HttpResponse

*Status*:`return { status: 200 };`

*Body*:Use the

`body`

property to return most types like a`string`

or`Buffer`

:`return { body: "Hello, world!" };`

Use the

`jsonBody`

property for the easiest way to return a JSON response:`return { jsonBody: { hello: "world" } };`

*Header*. You can set the header in two ways, depending on whether you're using the`HttpResponse`

class or the`HttpResponseInit`

interface:`const response = new HttpResponse(); response.headers.set('content-type', 'application/json'); return response;`

`return { headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' } };`


Tip

Update any logic by using the HTTP request or response types to match the new methods.

Tip

Update any logic by using the HTTP request or response types to match the new methods. You should get TypeScript build errors to help you identify if you're using old methods.

## Troubleshoot

See the [Node.js Troubleshoot guide](functions-node-troubleshoot).

# Tutorial: Create a function to integrate with Azure Logic Apps

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with Azure Logic Apps in the Logic Apps Designer. This integration allows you use the computing power of Functions in orchestrations with other Azure and third-party services.

This tutorial shows you how to create a workflow to analyze X activity. As tweets are evaluated, the workflow sends notifications when positive sentiments are detected.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

- Create an Azure AI services API Resource.
- Create a function that categorizes tweet sentiment.
- Create a logic app that connects to X.
- Add sentiment detection to the logic app.
- Connect the logic app to the function.
- Send an email based on the response from the function.

## Prerequisites

- An active
[X](https://x.com/)account. - An
[Outlook.com](https://outlook.com/)account (for sending notifications).

Note

If you want to use the Gmail connector, only G-Suite business accounts can use this connector without restrictions in logic apps. If you have a Gmail consumer account, you can use the Gmail connector with only specific Google-approved apps and services, or you can [create a Google client app to use for authentication in your Gmail connector](/en-us/connectors/gmail/#authentication-and-bring-your-own-application).

For more information, see [Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article demonstrates OpenTelemetry support in Azure Function, which enables distributed tracing across multiple function calls by using integrated Application Insights and OpenTelemetry support. To help you get started, an Azure Developer CLI (`azd`

) template is used to create your code project as well as the Azure deployment in which to run your app.

In this tutorial, you use the `azd`

tool to:

- Initialize an OpenTelemetry-enabled project from a template.
- Review the code that enables OpenTelemetry integration.
- Run and verify your OpenTelemetry-enabled app locally.
- Create a function app and related resources in Azure.
- Deploy your code project to the function app in Azure.
- Verify distributed tracing in Application Insights.

The required Azure resources created by this template follow current best practices for secure and scalable function app deployments in Azure. The same `azd`

command also deploys your code project to your new function app in Azure.

By default, the Flex Consumption plan follows a *pay-for-what-you-use* billing model, which means completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Important

This article currently supports only C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete the quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Initialize the project

Use the `azd init`

command to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template that includes OpenTelemetry distributed tracing.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-python-azd-otel -e flexquickstart-otel`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-otel)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name also appears in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-otel -e flexquickstart-otel`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-otel)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name also appears in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-otel -e flexquickstart-otel`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-otel)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name also appears in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

## Review the code

The template creates a complete distributed tracing scenario with three functions that work together. Let's review the key OpenTelemetry-related aspects:

### OpenTelemetry configuration

The `src/otel-sample/host.json`

file enables OpenTelemetry for the Functions host:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry",
"extensions": {
"serviceBus": {
"maxConcurrentCalls": 10
}
},
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


The key setting `"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry"`

enables distributed tracing across function calls.

The `src/OTelSample/host.json`

file enables OpenTelemetry for the Functions host:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry",
"logging": {
"OpenTelemetry": {
"logLevel": {
"Host.General": "Warning"
}
}
}
}
```


The key setting `"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry"`

enables distributed tracing across function calls.

### Dependencies for OpenTelemetry

The `src/otel-sample/requirements.txt`

file includes the necessary packages for OpenTelemetry integration:

```
azure-functions
azure-monitor-opentelemetry
requests
```


The `azure-monitor-opentelemetry`

package provides the OpenTelemetry integration with Application Insights.

The `src/otel-sample/package.json`

file includes the necessary packages for OpenTelemetry integration:

```
{
"dependencies": {
"@azure/functions": "^4.0.0",
"@azure/functions-opentelemetry-instrumentation": "^0.1.0",
"@azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter": "^1.0.0",
"axios": "^1.6.0"
}
}
```


The `@azure/functions-opentelemetry-instrumentation`

and `@azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter`

packages provide the OpenTelemetry integration with Application Insights.

The `.csproj`

file includes the necessary packages for OpenTelemetry integration:

```
<PackageReference Include="Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter" Version="1.4.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.OpenTelemetry" Version="1.4.0" />
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http" Version="1.10.0" />
```


These packages provide the OpenTelemetry integration with Application Insights and HTTP instrumentation for distributed tracing.

### Function implementation

The functions in `src/otel-sample/function_app.py`

demonstrate a distributed tracing flow:

#### First HTTP Function

```
@app.function_name("first_http_function")
@app.route(route="first_http_function", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
def first_http_function(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function (first) processed a request.')
# Call the second function
base_url = f"{req.url.split('/api/')[0]}/api"
second_function_url = f"{base_url}/second_http_function"
response = requests.get(second_function_url)
second_function_result = response.text
result = {
"message": "Hello from the first function!",
"second_function_response": second_function_result
}
return func.HttpResponse(
json.dumps(result),
status_code=200,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


#### Second HTTP Function

```
@app.function_name("second_http_function")
@app.route(route="second_http_function", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
@app.service_bus_queue_output(arg_name="outputsbmsg", queue_name="%ServiceBusQueueName%",
connection="ServiceBusConnection")
def second_http_function(req: func.HttpRequest, outputsbmsg: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function (second) processed a request.')
message = "This is the second function responding."
# Send a message to the Service Bus queue
queue_message = "Message from second HTTP function to trigger ServiceBus queue processing"
outputsbmsg.set(queue_message)
logging.info('Sent message to ServiceBus queue: %s', queue_message)
return func.HttpResponse(
message,
status_code=200
)
```


#### Service Bus Queue Trigger

```
@app.service_bus_queue_trigger(arg_name="azservicebus", queue_name="%ServiceBusQueueName%",
connection="ServiceBusConnection")
def servicebus_queue_trigger(azservicebus: func.ServiceBusMessage):
logging.info('Python ServiceBus Queue trigger start processing a message: %s',
azservicebus.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
time.sleep(5) # Simulate processing work
logging.info('Python ServiceBus Queue trigger end processing a message')
```


The OpenTelemetry configuration is set up in `src/otel-sample/index.ts`

:

```
import { AzureFunctionsInstrumentation } from '@azure/functions-opentelemetry-instrumentation';
import { AzureMonitorTraceExporter, AzureMonitorLogExporter } from '@azure/monitor-opentelemetry-exporter';
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations, getResourceDetectors } from '@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node';
import { registerInstrumentations } from '@opentelemetry/instrumentation';
import { detectResources } from '@opentelemetry/resources';
import { LoggerProvider, SimpleLogRecordProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-logs';
import { NodeTracerProvider, SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node';
const resource = detectResources({ detectors: getResourceDetectors() });
const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider({
resource,
spanProcessors: [new SimpleSpanProcessor(new AzureMonitorTraceExporter())]
});
tracerProvider.register();
const loggerProvider = new LoggerProvider({
resource,
processors: [new SimpleLogRecordProcessor(new AzureMonitorLogExporter())],
});
registerInstrumentations({
tracerProvider,
loggerProvider,
instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations(), new AzureFunctionsInstrumentation()],
});
```


The functions are defined in the `src/otel-sample/src/functions`

folder:

#### First HTTP Function

```
export async function firstHttpFunction(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log("TypeScript HTTP trigger function (first) processed a request.");
try {
// Call the second function
const baseUrl = request.url.split("/api/")[0];
const secondFunctionUrl = `${baseUrl}/api/second_http_function`;
const response = await axios.get(secondFunctionUrl);
const secondFunctionResult = response.data;
const result = {
message: "Hello from the first function!",
second_function_response: secondFunctionResult,
};
return {
status: 200,
body: JSON.stringify(result),
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
};
} catch (error) {
return {
status: 500,
body: JSON.stringify({ error: "Failed to process request" }),
};
}
}
```


#### Second HTTP Function

```
export async function secondHttpFunction(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log("TypeScript HTTP trigger function (second) processed a request.");
const message = "This is the second function responding.";
// Send a message to the Service Bus queue
const queueMessage =
"Message from second HTTP function to trigger ServiceBus queue processing";
context.extraOutputs.set(serviceBusOutput, queueMessage);
context.log("Sent message to ServiceBus queue:", queueMessage);
return {
status: 200,
body: message,
};
}
```


#### Service Bus Queue Trigger

```
export async function serviceBusQueueTrigger(
message: unknown,
context: InvocationContext
): Promise<void> {
context.log("TypeScript ServiceBus Queue trigger start processing a message:", message);
// Simulate processing time
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
context.log("TypeScript ServiceBus Queue trigger end processing a message");
}
```


The OpenTelemetry configuration is set up in `src/OTelSample/Program.cs`

:

```
using Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.OpenTelemetry;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;
var builder = FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication();
builder.Logging.AddOpenTelemetry(logging =>
{
logging.IncludeFormattedMessage = true;
logging.IncludeScopes = true;
});
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
.WithTracing(tracing =>
{
tracing.AddHttpClientInstrumentation();
});
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry().UseAzureMonitorExporter();
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry().UseFunctionsWorkerDefaults();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
builder.Build().Run();
```


The functions are defined in separate class files:

#### First HTTP Function

```
public class FirstHttpTrigger
{
private readonly ILogger<FirstHttpTrigger> _logger;
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _httpClientFactory;
public FirstHttpTrigger(ILogger<FirstHttpTrigger> logger, IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
{
_logger = logger;
_httpClientFactory = httpClientFactory;
}
[Function("first_http_function")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
_logger.LogInformation("first_http_function function processed a request.");
var baseUrl = $"{req.Url.AbsoluteUri.Split("/api/")[0]}/api";
var targetUri = $"{baseUrl}/second_http_function";
var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
var response = await client.GetAsync(targetUri);
var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
return new OkObjectResult($"Called second_http_function, status: {response.StatusCode}, content: {content}");
}
}
```


#### Second HTTP Function

```
public class SecondHttpTrigger
{
private readonly ILogger<SecondHttpTrigger> _logger;
public SecondHttpTrigger(ILogger<SecondHttpTrigger> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
[Function("second_http_function")]
public MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
_logger.LogInformation("second_http_function function processed a request.");
return new MultiResponse
{
Messages = new string[] { "Hello" },
HttpResponse = req.CreateResponse(System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
};
}
}
public class MultiResponse
{
[ServiceBusOutput("%ServiceBusQueueName%", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string[]? Messages { get; set; }
[HttpResult]
public HttpResponseData? HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


#### Service Bus Queue Trigger

```
public class ServiceBusQueueTrigger
{
private readonly ILogger<ServiceBusQueueTrigger> _logger;
public ServiceBusQueueTrigger(ILogger<ServiceBusQueueTrigger> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
[Function("servicebus_queue_trigger")]
public async Task Run(
[ServiceBusTrigger("%ServiceBusQueueName%", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
ServiceBusReceivedMessage message,
ServiceBusMessageActions messageActions)
{
_logger.LogInformation("Message ID: {id}", message.MessageId);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Body: {body}", message.Body);
// Complete the message
await messageActions.CompleteMessageAsync(message);
}
}
```


### Distributed tracing flow

This architecture creates a complete distributed tracing scenario, with this behavior:

**First HTTP function**receives an HTTP request and calls the second HTTP function**Second HTTP function**responds and sends a message to Service Bus**Service Bus trigger**processes the message with a delay to simulate processing work

Key aspects of the OpenTelemetry implementation:

**OpenTelemetry integration**: The`host.json`

file enables OpenTelemetry with`"telemetryMode": "OpenTelemetry"`

**Function chaining**: The first function calls the second using HTTP requests, creating correlated traces**Service Bus integration**: The second function outputs to Service Bus, which triggers the third function**Anonymous authentication**: The HTTP functions use`auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS`

, so no function keys are required

You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-otel).

**OpenTelemetry integration**: The`index.ts`

file configures OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor exporters for traces and logs**Function chaining**: The first function calls the second using axios with automatic trace propagation**Service Bus integration**: The second function outputs to Service Bus using output bindings, which triggers the third function**Managed identity**: All Service Bus connections use managed identity instead of connection strings**Processing simulation**: The 5-second delay in the Service Bus trigger simulates message processing work

You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-otel).

**OpenTelemetry integration**: The`Program.cs`

file configures OpenTelemetry with Azure Monitor exporter**Function chaining**: The first function calls the second using HttpClient with OpenTelemetry instrumentation**Service Bus integration**: The second function outputs to Service Bus using output bindings, which triggers the third function**Managed identity**: All Service Bus connections use managed identity instead of connection strings**.NET 8 Isolated Worker**: Uses the latest Azure Functions .NET Isolated Worker model for better performance and flexibility

You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-otel).

After you verify your functions locally, it's time to publish them to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

This project is configured to use the `azd up`

command to deploy this project to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure with OpenTelemetry support.

Tip

This project includes a set of Bicep files that `azd`

uses to create a secure deployment to a Flex consumption plan that follows best practices, including managed identity connections.

Run this command to have

`azd`

create the required Azure resources in Azure and deploy your code project to the new function app:`azd up`

The root folder contains the

`azure.yaml`

definition file required by`azd`

.If you're not already signed in, you're asked to authenticate with your Azure account.

When prompted, provide these required deployment parameters:

Parameter Description *Azure subscription*Subscription in which your resources are created. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. The

`azd up`

command uses your response to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to complete these deployment tasks:Create and configure these required Azure resources (equivalent to

`azd provision`

):- Azure Functions Flex Consumption plan and function app with OpenTelemetry enabled
- Azure Storage (required) and Application Insights (recommended)
- Service Bus namespace and queue for distributed tracing demonstration
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Service-to-service connections using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)

Package and deploy your code to the deployment container (equivalent to

`azd deploy`

). The app is then started and runs in the deployed package.

After the command completes successfully, you see links to the resources you created.


## Test distributed tracing

Now you can test the OpenTelemetry distributed tracing functionality by calling your deployed functions and observing the telemetry in Application Insights.

### Invoke the function on Azure

You can invoke your function endpoints in Azure by making HTTP requests to their URLs. Since the HTTP functions in this template are configured with anonymous access, no function keys are required.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this command to get the function app name and construct the URL:

`APP_NAME=$(azd env get-value AZURE_FUNCTION_NAME) echo "Function URL: https://$APP_NAME.azurewebsites.net/api/first_http_function"`

The

`azd env get-value`

command gets your function app name from the local environment.Test the function in your browser by navigating to the URL:

`https://your-function-app.azurewebsites.net/api/first_http_function`

Replace

`your-function-app`

with your actual function app name from the previous step. This single request creates a distributed trace that flows through all three functions.

### View distributed tracing in Application Insights

After invoking the function, you can observe the complete distributed trace in Application Insights:

Note

It might take a few minutes for telemetry data to appear in Application Insights after invoking your function. If you don't see data immediately, wait a few minutes and refresh the view.

Go to your Application Insights resource in the Azure portal (you can find it in the same resource group as your function app).

Open the

**Application map**to see the distributed trace across all three functions. You should see the flow from the HTTP request through your functions and to Service Bus.Check the

**Transaction search**to find your request and see the complete trace timeline. Search for transactions from your function app.Select a specific transaction to see the end-to-end trace that shows:

- The HTTP request to
`first_http_function`

- The internal HTTP call to
`second_http_function`

- The Service Bus message being sent
- The
`servicebus_queue_trigger`

processing the message from Service Bus

- The HTTP request to
In the trace details, you can see:

**Timing information**: How long each step took**Dependencies**: The connections between functions**Logs**: Application logs correlated with the trace**Performance metrics**: Response times and throughput


This example demonstrates end-to-end distributed tracing across multiple Azure Functions with OpenTelemetry integration, providing complete visibility into your application's behavior and performance.

## Redeploy your code

Run the `azd up`

command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

The latest deployment package always overwrites deployed code files.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that the command uses when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.
