# Tutorial: Apply machine learning models in Azure Functions with Python and TensorFlow

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to use Python, TensorFlow, and Azure Functions with a machine learning model to classify an image based on its contents. Because you do all work locally and create no Azure resources in the cloud, there is no cost to complete this tutorial.

- Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python.
- Import a custom TensorFlow machine learning model into a function app.
- Build a serverless HTTP API for classifying an image as containing a dog or a cat.
- Consume the API from a web app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). (Python 3.7.4 and Python 3.6.x are verified with Azure Functions; Python 3.8 and later versions are not yet supported.)- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) - A code editor such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Prerequisite check

- In a terminal or command window, run
`func --version`

to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 2.7.1846 or later. - Run
`python --version`

(Linux/macOS) or`py --version`

(Windows) to check your Python version reports 3.7.x.

## Clone the tutorial repository

In a terminal or command window, clone the following repository using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial.git`

Navigate into the folder and examine its contents.

`cd functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial`

*start*is your working folder for the tutorial.*end*is the final result and full implementation for your reference.*resources*contains the machine learning model and helper libraries.*frontend*is a website that calls the function app.


## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Navigate to the *start* folder and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Be sure to use Python 3.7, which is supported by Azure Functions.

```
cd start
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

.)

## Create a local functions project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single boilerplate function named `classify`

that provides an HTTP endpoint. You add more specific code in a later section.

In the

*start*folder, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to initialize a Python function app:`func init --worker-runtime python`

After initialization, the

*start*folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)and[host.json](functions-host-json). Because*local.settings.json*can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the*.gitignore*file.Tip

Because a function project is tied to a specific runtime, all the functions in the project must be written with the same language.

Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the

`--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the`--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger.`func new`

create a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named*function.json*.`func new --name classify --template "HTTP trigger"`

This command creates a folder matching the name of the function,

*classify*. In that folder are two files:*__init__.py*, which contains the function code, and*function.json*, which describes the function's trigger and its input and output bindings. For details on the contents of these files, see[Programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration#programming-model)in the Python developer guide.

## Run the function locally

Start the function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host in the

*start*folder:`func start`

Once you see the

`classify`

endpoint appear in the output, navigate to the URL,`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?name=Azure`

. The message "Hello Azure!" should appear in the output.Use

**Ctrl**-**C**to stop the host.

## Import the TensorFlow model and add helper code

To modify the `classify`

function to classify an image based on its contents, you use a pre-built TensorFlow model that was trained with and exported from Azure Custom Vision Service. The model, which is contained in the *resources* folder of the sample you cloned earlier, classifies an image based on whether it contains a dog or a cat. You then add some helper code and dependencies to your project.

To build your own model using the free tier of the Custom Vision Service, follow the instructions in the [sample project repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/blob/master/train-custom-vision-model.md).

Tip

If you want to host your TensorFlow model independent of the function app, you can instead mount a file share containing your model to your Linux function app. To learn more, see [Mount a file share to a Python function app using Azure CLI](scripts/functions-cli-mount-files-storage-linux).

In the

*start*folder, run following command to copy the model files into the*classify*folder. Be sure to include`\*`

in the command.`cp ../resources/model/* classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder contains files named*model.pb*and*labels.txt*. If not, check that you ran the command in the*start*folder.In the

*start*folder, run the following command to copy a file with helper code into the*classify*folder:`cp ../resources/predict.py classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder now contains a file named*predict.py*.Open

*start/requirements.txt*in a text editor and add the following dependencies required by the helper code:`tensorflow==1.14 Pillow requests`

Save

*requirements.txt*.Install the dependencies by running the following command in the

*start*folder. Installation may take a few minutes, during which time you can proceed with modifying the function in the next section.`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`

On Windows, you may encounter the error, "Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:" followed by a long pathname to a file like

*sharded_mutable_dense_hashtable.cpython-37.pyc*. Typically, this error happens because the depth of the folder path becomes too long. In this case, set the registry key`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem@LongPathsEnabled`

to`1`

to enable long paths. Alternately, check where your Python interpreter is installed. If that location has a long path, try reinstalling in a folder with a shorter path.

Tip

When calling upon *predict.py* to make its first prediction, a function named `_initialize`

loads the TensorFlow model from disk and caches it in global variables. This caching speeds up subsequent predictions.

## Update the function to run predictions

Open

*classify/__init__.py*in a text editor and add the following lines after the existing`import`

statements to import the standard JSON library and the*predict*helpers:`import logging import azure.functions as func import json # Import helper script from .predict import predict_image_from_url`

Replace the entire contents of the

`main`

function with the following code:`def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse: image_url = req.params.get('img') logging.info('Image URL received: ' + image_url) results = predict_image_from_url(image_url) headers = { "Content-type": "application/json", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" } return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(results), headers = headers)`

This function receives an image URL in a query string parameter named

`img`

. It then calls`predict_image_from_url`

from the helper library to download and classify the image using the TensorFlow model. The function then returns an HTTP response with the results.Important

Because this HTTP endpoint is called by a web page hosted on another domain, the response includes an

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header to satisfy the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.In a production application, change

`*`

to the web page's specific origin for added security.Save your changes, then assuming that dependencies have finished installing, start the local function host again with

`func start`

. Be sure to run the host in the*start*folder with the virtual environment activated. Otherwise the host will start, but you will see errors when invoking the function.`func start`

In a browser, open the following URL to invoke the function with the URL of a cat image and confirm that the returned JSON classifies the image as a cat.

`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?img=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat1.png`

Keep the host running because you use it in the next step.


### Run the local web app front end to test the function

To test invoking the function endpoint from another web app, there's a simple app in the repository's *frontend* folder.

Open a new terminal or command prompt and activate the virtual environment (as described earlier under

[Create and activate a Python virtual environment](#create-and-activate-a-python-virtual-environment)).Navigate to the repository's

*frontend*folder.Start an HTTP server with Python:

`python -m http.server`

In a browser, navigate to

`localhost:8000`

, then enter one of the following photo URLs into the textbox, or use the URL of any publicly accessible image.`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat1.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/cat2.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/dog1.png`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-tensorflow-tutorial/master/resources/assets/samples/dog2.png`


Select

**Submit**to invoke the function endpoint to classify the image.If the browser reports an error when you submit the image URL, check the terminal in which you're running the function app. If you see an error like "No module found 'PIL'", you may have started the function app in the

*start*folder without first activating the virtual environment you created earlier. If you still see errors, run`pip install -r requirements.txt`

again with the virtual environment activated and look for errors.

Note

The model always classifies the content of the image as a cat or a dog, regardless of whether the image contains either, defaulting to dog. Images of tigers and panthers, for example, typically classify as cat, but images of elephants, carrots, or airplanes classify as dog.

## Clean up resources

Because the entirety of this tutorial runs locally on your machine, there are no Azure resources or services to clean up.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to build and customize an HTTP API endpoint with Azure Functions to classify images using a TensorFlow model. You also learned how to call the API from a web app. You can use the techniques in this tutorial to build out APIs of any complexity, all while running on the serverless compute model provided by Azure Functions.

# Dapr Topic trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can be triggered on a Dapr topic subscription using the following Dapr events.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("TransferEventBetweenTopics")]
public static void Run(
[DaprTopicTrigger("%PubSubName%", Topic = "A")] CloudEvent subEvent,
[DaprPublish(PubSubName = "%PubSubName%", Topic = "B")] out DaprPubSubEvent pubEvent,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
pubEvent = new DaprPubSubEvent("Transfer from Topic A: " + subEvent.Data);
}
```


Here's the Java code for subscribing to a topic using the Dapr Topic trigger:

```
@FunctionName("PrintTopicMessage")
public String run(
@DaprTopicTrigger(
pubSubName = "%PubSubName%",
topic = "B")
String payload,
final ExecutionContext context) throws JsonProcessingException {
Logger logger = context.getLogger();
logger.info("Java function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.");
```


Use the `app`

object to register the `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('TransferEventBetweenTopics', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'daprTopicTrigger',
name: "subEvent",
pubsubname: "%PubSubName%",
topic: "A"
}),
return: daprPublishOutput,
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
context.log(context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data);
return { payload: context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data };
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "daprTopicTrigger",
"pubsubname": "%PubSubName%",
"topic": "B",
"name": "subEvent",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$subEvent
)
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $subEvent["data"] | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
Write-Host "Topic B received a message: $jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr Topic trigger, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="PrintTopicMessage")
@app.dapr_topic_trigger(arg_name="subEvent", pub_sub_name="%PubSubName%", topic="B", route="B")
def main(subEvent) -> None:
logging.info('Python function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.')
subEvent_json = json.loads(subEvent)
logging.info("Topic B received a message: " + subEvent_json["data"])
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprTopicTrigger`

to trigger a Dapr pub/sub binding, which supports the following properties.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
PubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
Topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Annotations

The `DaprTopicTrigger`

annotation allows you to create a function that runs when a topic is received.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
pubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties for `@dapp.dapr_topic_trigger`

that you set in your Python code.

| Property | Description | Can be sent via Attribute | Can be sent via RequestBody |
|---|---|---|---|
pub_sub_name |
The name of the Dapr subscription component type. | ✔️ | ❌ |
topic |
The subscription topic. | ✔️ | ❌ |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

To use a Dapr Topic trigger, start by setting up a Dapr pub/sub component. You can learn more about which component to use and how to set it up in the official Dapr documentation.

To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in Python v2, set up your project with the correct dependencies.

In your

`requirements.text`

file, add the following line:`azure-functions==1.18.0b3`

In the terminal, install the Python library.

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

# Azure Web PubSub output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the *Web PubSub* output binding to invoke Azure Web PubSub service to do something. You can send a message to:

- All connected clients
- Connected clients authenticated to a specific user
- Connected clients joined in a specific group
- A specific client connection

The output binding also allows you to manage clients and groups, and grant/revoke permissions targeting specific connectionId with group.

- Add connection to group
- Add user to group
- Remove connection from a group
- Remove user from a group
- Remove user from all groups
- Close all client connections
- Close a specific client connection
- Close connections in a group
- Grant permission of a connection
- Revoke permission of a connection

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-web-pubsub).

## Example

```
[Function("WebPubSubOutputBinding")]
[WebPubSubOutput(Hub = "<hub>", Connection = "<web_pubsub_connection_name>")]
public static WebPubSubAction Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
return new SendToAllAction
{
Data = BinaryData.FromString("Hello Web PubSub!"),
DataType = WebPubSubDataType.Text
};
}
```


```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const wpsMsg = output.generic({
type: 'webPubSub',
name: 'actions',
hub: '<hub>',
});
app.http('message', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [wpsMsg],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.extraOutputs.set(wpsMsg, [{
"actionName": "sendToAll",
"data": `Hello world`,
"dataType": `text`
}]);
}
});
```


Note

Complete samples for this language are pending

Note

The Web PubSub extensions for Java is not supported yet.

### WebPubSubAction

`WebPubSubAction`

is the base abstract type of output bindings. The derived types represent the action server want service to invoke.

In C# language, we provide a few static methods under `WebPubSubAction`

to help discover available actions. For example, user can create the `SendToAllAction`

by call `WebPubSubAction.CreateSendToAllAction()`

.

| Derived Class | Properties |
|---|---|
`SendToAllAction` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToGroupAction` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToUserAction` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`SendToConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`AddUserToGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromAllGroupsAction` |
UserId |
`AddConnectionToGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`RemoveConnectionFromGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`CloseAllConnectionsAction` |
Excluded, Reason |
`CloseClientConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`CloseGroupConnectionsAction` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`GrantPermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`RevokePermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

** actionName** is the key parameter to resolve the type. Available actions are listed as follows.

| ActionName | Properties |
|---|---|
`sendToAll` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToGroup` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToUser` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`sendToConnection` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`addUserToGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromAllGroups` |
UserId |
`addConnectionToGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`removeConnectionFromGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`closeAllConnections` |
Excluded, Reason |
`closeClientConnection` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`closeGroupConnections` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`grantPermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`revokePermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

Important

The message data property in the sent message related actions must be `string`

if data type is set to `json`

or `text`

to avoid data conversion ambiguity. Please use `JSON.stringify()`

to convert the json object in need. This is applied to any place using message property, for example, `UserEventResponse.Data`

working with `WebPubSubTrigger`

.

When data type is set to `binary`

, it's allowed to leverage binding naturally supported `dataType`

as `binary`

configured in the `function.json`

, see [Trigger and binding definitions](functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=csharp#trigger-and-binding-definitions) for details.

### Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file and the `WebPubSub`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `webPubSub` |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `out` |
name |
n/a | Variable name used in function code for output binding object. |
hub |
Hub | The value must be set to the name of the Web PubSub hub for the function to be triggered. We support set the value in attribute as higher priority, or it can be set in app settings as a global value. |
connection |
Connection | The name of the app setting that contains the Web PubSub Service connection string (defaults to "WebPubSubConnectionString"). |

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Web PubSub service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize a managed identity request by using Microsoft Entra ID](../azure-web-pubsub/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity).

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging

You can also easily [enable console logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) if you want to dig deeper into the requests you're making against the service.

# Connect functions to Azure services using bindings

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create a function, language-specific trigger code is added in your project from a set of trigger templates. If you want to connect your function to other services by using input or output bindings, you have to add specific binding definitions in your function. To learn more about bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

## Local development

When you develop functions locally, you need to update the function code to add bindings. For languages that use function.json, [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) provides tooling to add bindings to a function.

### Manually add bindings based on examples

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to add binding-specific attributes to the function definition in code.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to add binding-specific annotations to the function definition in code.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need to update the function code and add a definition to the function.json configuration file.

When adding a binding to an existing function, you need update the function definition, depending on your model:

The following example shows the function definition after adding a [Queue Storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output) to an [HTTP triggered function](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger):

Because an HTTP triggered function also returns an HTTP response, the function returns a `MultiResponse`

object, which represents both the HTTP and queue output.

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
```


This example is the definition of the `MultiResponse`

object that includes the output binding:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public IActionResult HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


When applying that example to your own project, you might need to change `HttpRequest`

to `HttpRequestData`

and `IActionResult`

to `HttpResponseData`

, depending on if you are using [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) or not.

Messages are sent to the queue when the function completes. The way you define the output binding depends on your process model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@FunctionName("HttpExample")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
```


For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=java#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=javascript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg

The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Python model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=python#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=typescript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

Use the following table to find examples of specific binding types that you can use to guide you in updating an existing function. First, choose the language tab that corresponds to your project.

Binding code for C# depends on the [specific process model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#benefits-of-the-isolated-worker-model).

When you use Visual Studio Code to develop your function and your function uses a function.json file, the Azure Functions extension can automatically add a binding to an existing function.json file. To learn more, see [Add input and output bindings](functions-develop-vs-code#add-input-and-output-bindings).

## Azure portal

When you develop your functions in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you add input and output bindings in the **Integrate** tab for a given function. The new bindings are added to either the function.json file or to the method attributes, depending on your language. The following articles show examples of how to add bindings to an existing function in the portal:

# Deploy serverless Java apps with Quarkus on Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you'll develop, build, and deploy a serverless Java app to Azure Functions by using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io). This article uses Quarkus Funqy and its built-in support for the Azure Functions HTTP trigger for Java. Using Quarkus with Azure Functions gives you the power of the Quarkus programming model with the scale and flexibility of Azure Functions. When you finish, you'll run serverless Quarkus applications on Azure Functions and continue to monitor your app on Azure.

## Prerequisites

- The
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/overview)installed on your own computer. - An
[Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/). If you don't have an Azure account, create a[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. [Java JDK 17](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)with`JAVA_HOME`

configured appropriately. This article was written with Java 17 in mind, but Azure Functions and Quarkus also support older versions of Java.[Apache Maven 3.8.1+](https://maven.apache.org).

## Create the app project

Use the following command to clone the sample Java project for this article. The sample is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quarkus-azure).

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/quarkus-azure
cd quarkus-azure
git checkout 2023-01-10
cd functions-quarkus
```


If you see a message about being in **detached HEAD** state, this message is safe to ignore. Because this article does not require any commits, detached HEAD state is appropriate.

Explore the sample function. Open the *functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/GreetingFunction.java* file.

Run the following command. The `@Funq`

annotation makes your method (in this case, `funqyHello`

) a serverless function.

```
@Funq
public String funqyHello() {
return "hello funqy";
}
```


Azure Functions Java has its own set of Azure-specific annotations, but these annotations aren't necessary when you're using Quarkus on Azure Functions in a simple capacity as we're doing here. For more information about Azure Functions Java annotations, see the [Azure Functions Java developer guide](functions-reference-java).

Unless you specify otherwise, the function's name is the same as the method name. You can also use the following command to define the function name with a parameter to the annotation:

```
@Funq("alternateName")
public String funqyHello() {
return "hello funqy";
}
```


The name is important. It becomes a part of the REST URI to invoke the function, as shown later in the article.

## Test the function locally

Use `mvn`

to run Quarkus dev mode on your local terminal. Running Quarkus in this way enables live reload with background compilation. When you modify your Java files and/or your resource files and refresh your browser, these changes will automatically take effect.

A browser refresh triggers a scan of the workspace. If the scan detects any changes, the Java files are recompiled and the application is redeployed. Your redeployed application services the request. If there are any problems with compilation or deployment, an error page will let you know.

In the following procedure, replace `yourResourceGroupName`

with a resource group name. Function app names must be globally unique across all of Azure. Resource group names must be globally unique within a subscription. This article achieves the necessary uniqueness by prepending the resource group name to the function name. Consider prepending a unique identifier to any names you create that must be unique. A useful technique is to use your initials followed by today's date in `mmdd`

format.

The resource group is not necessary for this part of the instructions, but it's required later. For simplicity, the Maven project requires you to define the property.

Invoke Quarkus dev mode:

`mvn -DskipTests -DresourceGroup=<yourResourceGroupName> quarkus:dev`

The output should look like this:

`... --/ __ \/ / / / _ | / _ \/ //_/ / / / __/ -/ /_/ / /_/ / __ |/ , _/ ,< / /_/ /\ \ --\___\_\____/_/ |_/_/|_/_/|_|\____/___/ INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) quarkus-azure-function 1.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus xx.xx.xx.) started in 1.290s. Listening on: http://localhost:8080 INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated. INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) Installed features: [cdi, funqy-http, smallrye-context-propagation, vertx] -- Tests paused Press [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>`

Access the function by using the

`CURL`

command on your local terminal:`curl localhost:8080/api/funqyHello`

The output should look like this:

`"hello funqy"`


## Add dependency injection to the function

The open-standard technology Jakarta EE Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) provides dependency injection in Quarkus.

Add a new function that uses dependency injection.

Create a

*GreetingService.java*file in the*functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus*directory. Use the following code as the source code of the file:`package io.quarkus; import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped; @ApplicationScoped public class GreetingService { public String greeting(String name) { return "Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, " + name; } }`

Save the file.

`GreetingService`

is an injectable bean that implements a`greeting()`

method. The method returns a`Welcome...`

string message with a`name`

parameter.Open the existing

*functions-quarkus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/GreetingFunction.java*file. Replace the class with the following code to add a new`gService`

field and the`greeting`

method:`package io.quarkus; import javax.inject.Inject; import io.quarkus.funqy.Funq; public class GreetingFunction { @Inject GreetingService gService; @Funq public String greeting(String name) { return gService.greeting(name); } @Funq public String funqyHello() { return "hello funqy"; } }`

Save the file.

Access the new

`greeting`

function by using the`curl`

command on your local terminal:`curl -d '"Dan"' -X POST localhost:8080/api/greeting`

The output should look like this:

`"Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, Dan"`

Important

Live Coding (also called dev mode) allows you to run the app and make changes on the fly. Quarkus will automatically recompile and reload the app when changes are made. This is a powerful and efficient style of developing that you'll use throughout this article.

Before you move forward to the next step, stop Quarkus dev mode by selecting Ctrl+C.


## Deploy the app to Azure

If you haven't already, sign in to your Azure subscription by using the following

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index)command and follow the on-screen directions:`az login`

Note

If multiple Azure tenants are associated with your Azure credentials, you must specify which tenant you want to sign in to. You can do this by using the

`--tenant`

option. For example:`az login --tenant contoso.onmicrosoft.com`

.Continue the process in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with

`az login --use-device-code`

.After you sign in successfully, the output on your local terminal should look similar to the following:

`xxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxx 'Microsoft' [ { "cloudName": "AzureCloud", "homeTenantId": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx", "id": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx", "isDefault": true, "managedByTenants": [], "name": "Contoso account services", "state": "Enabled", "tenantId": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx", "user": { "name": "user@contoso.com", "type": "user" } } ]`

Build and deploy the functions to Azure.

The

*pom.xml*file that you generated in the previous step uses`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

. Running`mvn install`

generates configuration files and a staging directory that`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

requires. For`yourResourceGroupName`

, use the value that you used previously.`mvn clean install -DskipTests -DtenantId=<your tenantId from shown previously> -DresourceGroup=<yourResourceGroupName> azure-functions:deploy`

During deployment, sign in to Azure. The

`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

plug-in is configured to prompt for Azure sign-in each time the project is deployed. During the build, output similar to the following appears:`[INFO] Auth type: DEVICE_CODE To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code AXCWTLGMP to authenticate.`

Do as the output says and authenticate to Azure by using the browser and the provided device code. Many other authentication and configuration options are available. The complete reference documentation for

`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

is available at[Azure Functions: Configuration Details](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Functions:-Configuration-Details).After authentication, the build should continue and finish. Make sure that output includes

`BUILD SUCCESS`

near the end.`Successfully deployed the artifact to https://quarkus-demo-123451234.azurewebsites.net`

You can also find the URL to trigger your function on Azure in the output log:

`[INFO] HTTP Trigger Urls: [INFO] quarkus : https://quarkus-azure-functions-http-archetype-20220629204040017.azurewebsites.net/api/{*path}`

It will take a while for the deployment to finish. In the meantime, let's explore Azure Functions in the Azure portal.


## Access and monitor the serverless function on Azure

Sign in to [the portal](https://aka.ms/publicportal) and ensure that you've selected the same tenant and subscription that you used in the Azure CLI.

Type

**function app**on the search bar at the top of the Azure portal and select the Enter key. Your function app should be deployed and show up with the name`<yourResourceGroupName>-function-quarkus`

.Select the function app to show detailed information, such as

**Location**,**Subscription**,**URL**,**Metrics**, and**App Service Plan**. Then, select the**URL**value.Confirm that the welcome page says your function app is "up and running."

Invoke the

`greeting`

function by using the following`curl`

command on your local terminal.Important

Replace

`YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL`

with your own function URL that you find in the Azure portal or output.`curl -d '"Dan on Azure"' -X POST https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/greeting`

The output should look similar to the following:

`"Welcome to build Serverless Java with Quarkus on Azure Functions, Dan on Azure"`

You can also access the other function (

`funqyHello`

) by using the following`curl`

command:`curl https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/funqyHello`

The output should be the same as what you observed earlier:

`"hello funqy"`

If you want to exercise the basic metrics capability in the Azure portal, try invoking the function within a shell

`for`

loop:`for i in {1..100}; do curl -d '"Dan on Azure"' -X POST https://YOUR_HTTP_TRIGGER_URL/api/greeting; done`

After a while, you'll see some metrics data in the portal.


Now that you've opened your Azure function in the portal, here are more features that you can access from the portal:

- Monitor the performance of your Azure function. For more information, see
[Monitoring Azure Functions](monitor-functions). - Explore telemetry. For more information, see
[Analyze Azure Functions telemetry in Application Insights](analyze-telemetry-data). - Set up logging. For more information, see
[Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions](streaming-logs).

## Clean up resources

If you don't need these resources, you can delete them by running the following command:

```
az group delete --name <yourResourceGroupName> --yes
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to:

- Run Quarkus dev mode.
- Deploy a Funqy app to Azure functions by using
`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

. - Examine the performance of the function in the portal.

# Quickstart: Respond to database changes in Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this Quickstart, you use Visual Studio Code to build an app that responds to database changes in a No SQL database in Azure Cosmos DB. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to a new serverless function app you create running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project source uses the Azure Developer CLI (azd) extension with Visual Studio Code to simplify initializing and verifying your project code locally, as well as and deploying your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

Important

While responding to [changes in an Azure Cosmos DB No SQL database](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-trigger) is supported for all languages, this quickstart scenario currently only has examples for C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete this quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)for Visual Studio Code. This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local). When this tool isn't available locally, the extension tries to install it by using a package-based installer. You can also install or update the Core Tools package by running`Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools`

from the command palette. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead[manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

[C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)for Visual Studio Code.

- The
[Azure Developer CLI extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-dev)for Visual Studio Code.

## Initialize the project

You can use the `azd init`

command from the command palette to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

In Visual Studio Code, open a folder or workspace in which you want to create your project.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Initialize App (init)`

, and then choose**Select a template**.There might be a slight delay while

`azd`

initializes the current folder or workspace.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions with Cosmos DB Bindings (.NET)`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-dotnet`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions TypeScript CosmosDB trigger`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-ts`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

When prompted, choose

**Select a template**, then search for and select`Azure Functions Python with CosmosDB triggers and bindings...`

.When prompted, enter a unique environment name, such as

`cosmosdbchanges-py`

.This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-cosmosdb)and initializes the project in the current folder or workspace. In`azd`

, the environment is used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. It's also part of the name of the resource group you create in Azure.

Run this command, depending on your local operating system, to grant configuration scripts the required permissions:

Run this command with sufficient privileges:

`chmod +x ./infra/scripts/*.sh`


Before you can run your app locally, you must create the resources in Azure. This project doesn't use local emulation for Azure Cosmos DB.

## Create Azure resources

This project is configured to use the `azd provision`

command to create a function app in a Flex Consumption plan, along with other required Azure resources that follows current best practices.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Sign In with Azure Developer CLI`

, and then sign in using your Azure account.Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Provision Azure resources (provision)`

to create the required Azure resources:When prompted in the Terminal window, provide these required deployment parameters:

Prompt Description Select an Azure Subscription to use Choose the subscription in which you want your resources to be created. *location*deployment parameterAzure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. *vnetEnabled*deployment parameterWhile the template supports creating resources inside a virtual network, to simplify deployment and testing, choose `False`

.The

`azd provision`

command uses your response to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to create and configure these required Azure resources, following the latest best practices:- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Cosmos DB account
- Azure Storage (required) and Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Service-to-service connections using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)

Post-provision hooks also generate the

*local.settings.json*file required when running locally. This file also contains the settings required to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB database in Azure.Tip

Should any steps fail during provisioning, you can rerun the

`azd provision`

command again after resolving any issues.After the command completes successfully, you can run your project code locally and trigger on the Azure Cosmos DB database in Azure.


## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to your new function app in Azure.

Press

`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`Azurite: Start`

.To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel, and you can see the name of the function that's running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, press`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`NoSQL: Create Item...`

and select both the`document-db`

database and the`documents`

container.Replace the contents of the

*New Item.json*file with this JSON data and select**Save**:`{ "id": "doc1", "title": "Sample document", "content": "This is a sample document for testing my Azure Cosmos DB trigger in Azure Functions." }`

After you select

**Save**, you see the execution of the function in the terminal and the local document is updated to include metadata added by the service.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

## Review the code (optional)

The function is triggered based on the change feed in an Azure Cosmos DB NoSQL database. These environment variables configure how the trigger monitors the change feed:

`COSMOS_CONNECTION__accountEndpoint`

: The Cosmos DB account endpoint`COSMOS_DATABASE_NAME`

: The name of the database to monitor`COSMOS_CONTAINER_NAME`

: The name of the container to monitor

These environment variables are created for you both in Azure (function app settings) and locally (local.settings.json) during the `azd provision`

operation.

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [CosmosTrigger.cs project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/CosmosTrigger.cs).

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [cosmos_trigger.ts project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/src/functions/cosmos_trigger.ts).

You can review the code that defines the Azure Cosmos DB trigger in the [function_app.py project file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-cosmosdb/blob/main/function_app.py).

After you review and verify your function code locally, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

You can run the `azd deploy`

command from Visual Studio Code to deploy the project code to your already provisioned resources in Azure.

Press

`F1`to open the command palette, search for and run the command`Azure Developer CLI (azd): Deploy to Azure (deploy)`

.The

`azd deploy`

command packages and deploys your code to the deployment container. The app is then started and runs in the deployed package.After the command completes successfully, your app is running in Azure.


## Invoke the function on Azure

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`and in the command palette search for and run the command`Azure: Open in portal`

, select`Function app`

, and choose your new app. Sign in with your Azure account, if necessary.This command opens your new function app in the Azure portal.

In the

**Overview**tab on the main page, select your function app name and then the**Logs**tab.Use the

`NoSQL: Create Item`

command in Visual Studio Code to again add a document to the container as before.Verify again that the function gets triggered by an update in the monitored container.


## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd deploy`

command as many times as you need to deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that were used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

# SignalR Service input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Before a client can connect to Azure SignalR Service, it must retrieve the service endpoint URL and a valid access token. The *SignalRConnectionInfo* input binding produces the SignalR Service endpoint URL and a valid token that are used to connect to the service. The token is time-limited and can be used to authenticate a specific user to a connection. Therefore, you shouldn't cache the token or share it between clients. Usually you use *SignalRConnectionInfo* with HTTP trigger for clients to retrieve the connection information.

For more information on how to use this binding to create a "negotiate" function that is compatible with a SignalR client SDK, see [Azure Functions development and configuration with Azure SignalR Service](../azure-signalr/signalr-concept-serverless-development-config).

When not explicitly declared, assume that examples are using the default connection setting value of `AzureSignalRConnectionString`

. For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-signalr-service).

## Example

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that acquires SignalR connection information using the input binding and returns it over HTTP.

```
[Function(nameof(Negotiate))]
public static string Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)] HttpRequestData req,
[SignalRConnectionInfoInput(HubName = "serverless")] string connectionInfo)
{
// The serialization of the connection info object is done by the framework. It should be camel case. The SignalR client respects the camel case response only.
return connectionInfo;
}
```


The following example shows a SignalR connection info input binding in a *function.json* file and a function that uses the binding to return the connection information.

Here's binding data for the example in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
"name": "connectionInfo",
"hubName": "hubName1",
"connectionStringSetting": "<name of setting containing SignalR Service connection string>",
"direction": "in"
}
```


Here's the JavaScript code:

```
const { app, input } = require('@azure/functions');
const inputSignalR = input.generic({
type: 'signalRConnectionInfo',
name: 'connectionInfo',
hubName: 'hubName1',
connectionStringSetting: 'AzureSignalRConnectionString',
});
app.post('negotiate', {
authLevel: 'function',
handler: (request, context) => {
return { body: JSON.stringify(context.extraInputs.get(inputSignalR)) }
},
route: 'negotiate',
extraInputs: [inputSignalR],
});
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

The following example shows a SignalR connection info input binding in a *function.json* file and a [Python function](functions-reference-python) that uses the binding to return the connection information.

Here's the Python code:

```
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, connectionInfoJson: str) -> func.HttpResponse:
return func.HttpResponse(
connectionInfoJson,
status_code=200,
headers={
'Content-type': 'application/json'
}
)
```


The following example shows a [Java function](functions-reference-java) that acquires SignalR connection information using the input binding and returns it over HTTP.

```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(
name = "connectionInfo",
HubName = "hubName1") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file.

The following table explains the properties of the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

attribute:

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
HubName |
Required. The hub name. |
ConnectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting or settings collection that contains the SignalR Service connection string, which defaults to `AzureSignalRConnectionString` . |
UserId |
Optional. The user identifier of a SignalR connection. You can use a
|

**IdToken****ClaimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**ClaimTypeList****IdToken**.## Annotations

The following table explains the supported settings for the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

annotation.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|

userId |
Optional. The user identifier of a SignalR connection. You can use a
|

**idToken****claimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**claimTypeList****idToken**.## Annotations

The following table explains the supported settings for the `SignalRConnectionInfoInput`

annotation.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|

|

**idToken****claimTypeList**. You can use a[binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger)to bind the value to an HTTP request header or query.**claimTypeList****idToken**.Warning

For the simplicity, we omit the authentication and authorization parts in this sample. As a result, this endpoint is publicly accessible without any restrictions. To ensure the security of your negotiation endpoint, you should implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms based on your specific requirements. For guidance on protecting your HTTP endpoints, see the following articles:

## Usage

### Managed identity-based connections

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Azure SignalR service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure SignalR Service resources with Microsoft Entra managed identities](../azure-signalr/signalr-howto-authorize-managed-identity#azure-signalr-service-bindings-in-azure-functions).

### Authenticated tokens

When an authenticated client triggers the function, you can add a user ID claim to the generated token. You can easily add authentication to a function app using [App Service Authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization).

App Service authentication sets HTTP headers named `x-ms-client-principal-id`

and `x-ms-client-principal-name`

that contain the authenticated user's client principal ID and name, respectively.

You can set the `UserId`

property of the binding to the value from either header using a [binding expression](#binding-expressions-for-http-trigger): `{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}`

or `{headers.x-ms-client-principal-name}`

.

```
[Function("Negotiate")]
public static string Negotiate([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous)] HttpRequestData req,
[SignalRConnectionInfoInput(HubName = "hubName1", UserId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}")] string connectionInfo)
{
// The serialization of the connection info object is done by the framework. It should be camel case. The SignalR client respects the camel case response only.
return connectionInfo;
}
```


```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST, HttpMethod.GET },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(name = "connectionInfo", hubName = "hubName1", userId = "{headers.x-ms-signalr-userid}") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


Here's binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"type": "signalRConnectionInfo",
"name": "connectionInfo",
"hubName": "hubName1",
"userId": "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}",
"connectionStringSetting": "<name of setting containing SignalR Service connection string>",
"direction": "in"
}
```


Here's the JavaScript code:

```
const { app, input } = require('@azure/functions');
const inputSignalR = input.generic({
type: 'signalRConnectionInfo',
name: 'connectionInfo',
hubName: 'hubName1',
connectionStringSetting: 'AzureSignalRConnectionString',
userId: '{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}',
});
app.post('negotiate', {
authLevel: 'function',
handler: (request, context) => {
return { body: JSON.stringify(context.extraInputs.get(inputSignalR)) }
},
route: 'negotiate',
extraInputs: [inputSignalR],
});
```


Complete PowerShell examples are pending.

Here's the Python code:

```
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, connectionInfo: str) -> func.HttpResponse:
# connectionInfo contains an access key token with a name identifier
# claim set to the authenticated user
return func.HttpResponse(
connectionInfo,
status_code=200,
headers={
'Content-type': 'application/json'
}
)
```


```
@FunctionName("negotiate")
public SignalRConnectionInfo negotiate(
@HttpTrigger(
name = "req",
methods = { HttpMethod.POST },
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> req,
@SignalRConnectionInfoInput(
name = "connectionInfo",
HubName = "hubName1",
userId = "{headers.x-ms-client-principal-id}") SignalRConnectionInfo connectionInfo) {
return connectionInfo;
}
```


### Binding expressions for HTTP trigger

[
It's a common scenario that the values of some attributes of SignalR input binding come from HTTP requests. Therefore, we show how to bind values from HTTP requests to SignalR input binding attributes via ][binding expression](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns#trigger-metadata).

| HTTP metadata type | Binding expression format | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP request query | `{query.QUERY_PARAMETER_NAME}` |
Binds the value of corresponding query parameter to an attribute | `{query.userName}` |
| HTTP request header | `{headers.HEADER_NAME}` |
Binds the value of a header to an attribute | `{headers.token}` |

# Quickstart: Create your first C# function in Azure using Visual Studio

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions lets you use Visual Studio to create local C# function projects and then easily publish this project to run in a scalable serverless environment in Azure. If you prefer to develop your C# apps locally using Visual Studio Code, you should instead consider the [Visual Studio Code-based version](how-to-create-function-vs-code?pivot=programming-language-csharp) of this article.

By default, this article shows you how to create C# functions that run on .NET 8 in an [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). Function apps that run in an isolated worker process are supported on all versions of .NET that are supported by Functions. For more information, see [Supported versions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#supported-versions).

In this article, you learn how to:

- Use Visual Studio to create a C# class library project.
- Create a function that responds to HTTP requests.
- Run your code locally to verify function behavior.
- Deploy your code project to Azure Functions.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

This video shows you how to create a C# function in Azure.

The steps in the video are also described in the following sections.

## Prerequisites

[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). Make sure to select the**Azure development**workload during installation.[Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't already have an account,[create a free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

## Create a function app project

The Azure Functions project template in Visual Studio creates a C# class library project that you can publish to a function app in Azure. You can use a function app to group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, scaling, and sharing of resources.

From the Visual Studio menu, select

**File**>**New**>**Project**.In

**Create a new project**, enter*functions*in the search box, choose the**Azure Functions**template, and then select**Next**.In

**Configure your new project**, enter a**Project name**for your project, and then select**Next**. The function app name must be valid as a C# namespace, so don't use underscores, hyphens, or any other nonalphanumeric characters.For the remaining

**Additional information**settings,Setting Value Description **Functions worker****.NET 8.0 Isolated (Long Term Support)**Your functions run on .NET 8 in an isolated worker process. **Function****HTTP trigger**This value creates a function triggered by an HTTP request. **Use Azurite for runtime storage account (AzureWebJobsStorage)**Enable Because a function app in Azure requires a storage account, one is assigned or created when you publish your project to Azure. An HTTP trigger doesn't use an Azure Storage account connection string; all other trigger types require a valid Azure Storage account connection string. When you select this option, the [Azurite emulator](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio)is used.**Authorization level****Anonymous**The created function can be triggered by any client without providing a key. This authorization setting makes it easy to test your new function. For more information, see [Authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth).Make sure you set the

**Authorization level**to**Anonymous**. If you choose the default level of**Function**, you're required to present the[function key](function-keys-how-to)in requests to access your function endpoint in Azure.Select

**Create**to create the function project and HTTP trigger function.

Visual Studio creates a project and class that contains boilerplate code for the HTTP trigger function type. The boilerplate code sends an HTTP response that includes a value from the request body or query string. The `HttpTrigger`

attribute specifies that the function is triggered by an HTTP request.

## Rename the function

The `Function`

method attribute sets the name of the function, which by default is generated as `Function1`

. Since the tooling doesn't let you override the default function name when you create your project, take a minute to create a better name for the function class, file, and metadata.

In

**File Explorer**, right-click the Function1.cs file and rename it to`HttpExample.cs`

.In the code, rename the Function1 class to

`HttpExample`

.In the method named

`Run`

, rename the`Function`

method attribute to`HttpExample`

.

Your function definition should now look like the following code:

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public IActionResult Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req)
{
_logger. LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult("Hello, functions");
}
```


Now that you've renamed the function, you can test it on your local computer.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can test your functions locally using the full Azure Functions runtime.

To run your function, press

`F5`in Visual Studio. You might need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests. Authorization levels are never enforced when you run a function locally.Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.

Paste the URL for the HTTP request into your browser's address bar and run the request. The following image shows the response in the browser to the local GET request returned by the function:

To stop debugging, press

`Shift`+`F5`in Visual Studio.

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to publish the project to Azure.

## Publish the project to Azure

Visual Studio can publish your local project to Azure. Before you can publish your project, you must have a function app in your Azure subscription. If you don't already have a function app in Azure, Visual Studio can help you create one before you publish your project. In this article, you create a function app that runs on Linux in a Flex Consumption plan, which is the recommended plan for event-driven and secure serverless functions.

In

**Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and then select**Publish**.On the

**Publish**page, make the following selections:- On
**Target**, select**Azure**, and then select**Next**. - On
**Specific target**, select**Azure Function App**, and then select**Next**. - On
**Functions instance**, select**Create new**.

- On
Create a new instance by using the values specified in the following table:

Setting Value Description **Name**A globally unique name The name must uniquely identify your new function app. Accept the suggested name or enter a new name. The following characters are valid: `a-z`

,`0-9`

, and`-`

.**Subscription name**The name of your subscription The function app is created in an Azure subscription. Accept the default subscription or select a different one from the list. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)The name of your resource group The function app is created in a resource group. Select **New**to create a new resource group. You can also select an existing resource group from the list.[Plan Type](functions-scale)**Flex Consumption**When you publish your project to a function app that runs in a [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan), you might pay only for executions of your functions app. Other hosting plans can incur higher costs.**IMPORTANT:**

When creating a Flex Consumption plan, you must first select**App service plan**and then reselect**Flex Consumption**to clear an issue with the dialog.**Operating system****Linux**The Flex Consumption plan currently requires Linux. **Location**The location of the app service Select a location in an [Azure region supported by the Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-how-to#view-currently-supported-regions). When an unsupported region is selected, the**Create**button is grayed-out.**Instance memory size****2048**The [memory size of the virtual machine instances](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes)in which the app runs is unique to the Flex Consumption plan.[Azure Storage](storage-considerations)A general-purpose storage account The Functions runtime requires a Storage account. Select **New**to configure a general-purpose storage account. You can also use an existing account that meets the[storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).[Application Insights](functions-monitoring)An Application Insights instance You should turn on Application Insights integration for your function app. Select **New**to create a new instance, either in a new or in an existing Log Analytics workspace. You can also use an existing instance.Select

**Create**to create a function app and its related resources in Azure. The status of resource creation is shown in the lower-left corner of the window.Select

**Finish**. The**Publish profile creation progress**window appears. When the profile is created, select**Close**.On the publish profile page, select

**Publish**to deploy the package that contains your project files to your new function app in Azure.When deployment is complete, the root URL of the function app in Azure is shown on the publish profile page.

On the publish profile page, go to the

**Hosting**section. Select the ellipsis (**...**), and then select**Open in Azure portal**. The new function app Azure resource opens in the Azure portal.

## Verify your function in Azure

In the Azure portal, you should be in the

**Overview**page for your new functions app.Under

**Functions**, select your new function named**HttpExample**, then in the function page select**Get function URL**and then the**Copy to clipboard icon**.In the address bar in your browser, paste the URL you copied and run the request.

The URL that calls your HTTP trigger function is in the following format:

`https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

Go to this URL and you see a response in the browser to the remote GET request returned by the function, which looks like the following example:


## Clean up resources

*Resources* in Azure refer to function apps, functions, storage accounts, and so forth. They're grouped into *resource groups*, and you can delete everything in a group by deleting the group.

You created Azure resources to complete this quickstart. You could be billed for these resources, depending on your [account status](https://azure.microsoft.com/account/) and [service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/). Other quickstarts in this collection build upon this quickstart. If you plan to work with subsequent quickstarts, tutorials, or with any of the services you've created in this quickstart, don't clean up the resources.

Use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

In the Visual Studio Publish dialogue, in the Hosting section, select

**Open in Azure portal**.In the function app page, select the

**Overview**tab and then select the link under**Resource group**.In the

**Resource group**page, review the list of included resources, and verify that they're the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**, and follow the instructions.Deletion may take a couple of minutes. When it's done, a notification appears for a few seconds. You can also select the bell icon at the top of the page to view the notification.


## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used Visual Studio to create and publish a C# function app in Azure with a simple HTTP trigger function.

To learn more about working with C# functions that run in an isolated worker process, see the [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide). Check out [.NET supported versions](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions) to see other versions of supported .NET versions in an isolated worker process.

# Azure Cosmos DB bindings for Azure Functions 1.x

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

[Support will end for version 1.x of the Azure Functions runtime on September 14, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/hostv1). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to version 4.x](migrate-version-1-version-4) for full support.

This article explains how to work with [Azure Cosmos DB](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless-computing-database) bindings in Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger, input, and output bindings for Azure Cosmos DB.

Keep these important considerations in mind when using the Azure Cosmos DB binding for the Functions v1.x runtime:

This article is for Azure Functions 1.x. We recommend that you run your functions on the most recent version of the Functions runtime. For information about how to use these bindings in the latest Functions runtime, see

[Azure Cosmos DB bindings for Azure Functions 2.x](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2).This binding was originally named DocumentDB. In Azure Functions version 1.x, only the trigger was renamed Azure Cosmos DB; the input binding, output binding, and NuGet package retain the DocumentDB name.

Azure Cosmos DB bindings are only supported for use with the SQL API. For all other Azure Cosmos DB APIs, you should access the database from your function by using the static client for your API, including

[Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction),[Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/cassandra-introduction),[Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph-introduction), and[Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table-introduction).The Azure Cosmos DB bindings for the Functions v1.x runtime don't support Microsoft Entra authentication and managed identities. To improve security, you should upgrade to run on the latest version of the Functions runtime.


## Packages - Functions 1.x

The Azure Cosmos DB bindings for Functions version 1.x are provided in the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB) NuGet package, version 1.x. Source code for the bindings is in the [azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/tree/v2.x/src/WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB) GitHub repository.

The following table lists how to add support for output binding in each development environment.

| Development environment | To add support in Functions 1.x |
|---|---|
| Local development: C# class library |
|

## Trigger

The Azure Cosmos DB Trigger uses the [Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/change-feed) to listen for inserts and updates across partitions. The change feed publishes inserts and updates, not deletions.

## Trigger - example

The following example shows an [in-process C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that is invoked when there are inserts or updates in the specified database and collection.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class CosmosTrigger
{
[FunctionName("CosmosTrigger")]
public static void Run([CosmosDBTrigger(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
LeaseCollectionName = "leases",
CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists = true)]IReadOnlyList<Document> documents,
TraceWriter log)
{
if (documents != null && documents.Count > 0)
{
log.Info($"Documents modified: {documents.Count}");
log.Info($"First document Id: {documents[0].Id}");
}
}
}
}
```


## Trigger - attributes

For [in-process C# class libraries](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the [CosmosDBTrigger](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB/Trigger/CosmosDBTriggerAttribute.cs) attribute.

The attribute's constructor takes the database name and collection name. For information about those settings and other properties that you can configure, see [Trigger - configuration](#trigger---configuration). Here's a `CosmosDBTrigger`

attribute example in a method signature:

```
[FunctionName("DocumentUpdates")]
public static void Run(
[CosmosDBTrigger("database", "collection", ConnectionStringSetting = "myCosmosDB")]
IReadOnlyList<Document> documents,
TraceWriter log)
{
...
}
```


For a complete example, see [Trigger - C# example](#trigger).

## Trigger - configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `CosmosDBTrigger`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `cosmosDBTrigger` . |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `in` . This parameter is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
n/a | The variable name used in function code that represents the list of documents with changes. |
connectionStringSetting |
ConnectionStringSetting |
The name of an app setting that contains the connection string used to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account being monitored. |
databaseName |
DatabaseName |
The name of the Azure Cosmos DB database with the collection being monitored. |
collectionName |
CollectionName |
The name of the collection being monitored. |
leaseConnectionStringSetting |
LeaseConnectionStringSetting |
(Optional) The name of an app setting that contains the connection string to the service which holds the lease collection. When not set, the `connectionStringSetting` value is used. This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created in the portal. The connection string for the leases collection must have write permissions. |
leaseDatabaseName |
LeaseDatabaseName |
(Optional) The name of the database that holds the collection used to store leases. When not set, the value of the `databaseName` setting is used. This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created in the portal. |
leaseCollectionName |
LeaseCollectionName |
(Optional) The name of the collection used to store leases. When not set, the value `leases` is used. |
createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists |
CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists |
(Optional) When set to `true` , the leases collection is automatically created when it doesn't already exist. The default value is `false` . |
leasesCollectionThroughput |
LeasesCollectionThroughput |
(Optional) Defines the amount of Request Units to assign when the leases collection is created. This setting is only used When `createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists` is set to `true` . This parameter is automatically set when the binding is created using the portal. |
leaseCollectionPrefix |
LeaseCollectionPrefix |
(Optional) When set, it adds a prefix to the leases created in the Lease collection for this Function, effectively allowing two separate Azure Functions to share the same Lease collection by using different prefixes. |
feedPollDelay |
FeedPollDelay |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the delay in between polling a partition for new changes on the feed, after all current changes are drained. Default is 5000 (5 seconds). |
leaseAcquireInterval |
LeaseAcquireInterval |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval to kick off a task to compute if partitions are distributed evenly among known host instances. Default is 13000 (13 seconds). |
leaseExpirationInterval |
LeaseExpirationInterval |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval for which the lease is taken on a lease representing a partition. If the lease is not renewed within this interval, it will cause it to expire and ownership of the partition will move to another instance. Default is 60000 (60 seconds). |
leaseRenewInterval |
LeaseRenewInterval |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the renew interval for all leases for partitions currently held by an instance. Default is 17000 (17 seconds). |
checkpointFrequency |
CheckpointFrequency |
(Optional) When set, it defines, in milliseconds, the interval between lease checkpoints. Default is always after each Function call. |
maxItemsPerInvocation |
MaxItemsPerInvocation |
(Optional) When set, it customizes the maximum amount of items received per Function call. |
startFromBeginning |
StartFromBeginning |
(Optional) When set, it tells the Trigger to start reading changes from the beginning of the history of the collection instead of the current time. This only works the first time the Trigger starts, as in subsequent runs, the checkpoints are already stored. Setting this to `true` when there are leases already created has no effect. |

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Trigger - usage

The trigger requires a second collection that it uses to store *leases* over the partitions. Both the collection being monitored and the collection that contains the leases must be available for the trigger to work.

Important

If multiple functions are configured to use an Azure Cosmos DB trigger for the same collection, each of the functions should use a dedicated lease collection or specify a different `LeaseCollectionPrefix`

for each function. Otherwise, only one of the functions will be triggered. For information about the prefix, see the [Configuration section](#trigger---configuration).

The trigger doesn't indicate whether a document was updated or inserted, it just provides the document itself. If you need to handle updates and inserts differently, you could do that by implementing timestamp fields for insertion or update.

## Input

The Azure Cosmos DB input binding uses the SQL API to retrieve one or more Azure Cosmos DB documents and passes them to the input parameter of the function. The document ID or query parameters can be determined based on the trigger that invokes the function.

## Input - example

This section contains the following examples:

[Queue trigger, look up ID from JSON](#queue-trigger-look-up-id-from-json-c)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-query-string-c)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-route-data-c)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data, using SqlQuery](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-route-data-using-sqlquery-c)[HTTP trigger, get multiple docs, using SqlQuery](#http-trigger-get-multiple-docs-using-sqlquery-c)[HTTP trigger, get multiple docs, using DocumentClient](#http-trigger-get-multiple-docs-using-documentclient-c)

The examples refer to a simple `ToDoItem`

type:

```
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public class ToDoItem
{
public string Id { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
}
}
```


### Queue trigger, look up ID from JSON

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by a queue message that contains a JSON object. The queue trigger parses the JSON into an object named `ToDoItemLookup`

, which contains the ID to look up. That ID is used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public class ToDoItemLookup
{
public string ToDoItemId { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocByIdFromJSON
{
[FunctionName("DocByIdFromJSON")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("todoqueueforlookup")] ToDoItemLookup toDoItemLookup,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
Id = "{ToDoItemId}")]ToDoItem toDoItem,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed Id={toDoItemLookup?.ToDoItemId}");
if (toDoItem == null)
{
log.Info($"ToDo item not found");
}
else
{
log.Info($"Found ToDo item, Description={toDoItem.Description}");
}
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID to look up. That ID is used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocByIdFromQueryString
{
[FunctionName("DocByIdFromQueryString")]
public static HttpResponseMessage Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)]HttpRequestMessage req,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
Id = "{Query.id}")] ToDoItem toDoItem,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
if (toDoItem == null)
{
log.Info($"ToDo item not found");
}
else
{
log.Info($"Found ToDo item, Description={toDoItem.Description}");
}
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses route data to specify the ID to look up. That ID is used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocByIdFromRouteData
{
[FunctionName("DocByIdFromRouteData")]
public static HttpResponseMessage Run(
[HttpTrigger(
AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post",
Route = "todoitems/{id}")]HttpRequestMessage req,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
Id = "{id}")] ToDoItem toDoItem,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
if (toDoItem == null)
{
log.Info($"ToDo item not found");
}
else
{
log.Info($"Found ToDo item, Description={toDoItem.Description}");
}
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data, using SqlQuery

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses route data to specify the ID to look up. That ID is used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocByIdFromRouteDataUsingSqlQuery
{
[FunctionName("DocByIdFromRouteDataUsingSqlQuery")]
public static HttpResponseMessage Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post",
Route = "todoitems2/{id}")]HttpRequestMessage req,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
SqlQuery = "select * from ToDoItems r where r.id = {id}")] IEnumerable<ToDoItem> toDoItems,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
foreach (ToDoItem toDoItem in toDoItems)
{
log.Info(toDoItem.Description);
}
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, get multiple docs, using SqlQuery

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a list of documents. The function is triggered by an HTTP request. The query is specified in the `SqlQuery`

attribute property.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocsBySqlQuery
{
[FunctionName("DocsBySqlQuery")]
public static HttpResponseMessage Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)]
HttpRequestMessage req,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",
SqlQuery = "SELECT top 2 * FROM c order by c._ts desc")]
IEnumerable<ToDoItem> toDoItems,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
foreach (ToDoItem toDoItem in toDoItems)
{
log.Info(toDoItem.Description);
}
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, get multiple docs, using DocumentClient (C#)

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that retrieves a list of documents. The function is triggered by an HTTP request. The code uses a `DocumentClient`

instance provided by the Azure Cosmos DB binding to read a list of documents. The `DocumentClient`

instance could also be used for write operations.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client;
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Linq;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class DocsByUsingDocumentClient
{
[FunctionName("DocsByUsingDocumentClient")]
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)]HttpRequestMessage req,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection")] DocumentClient client,
TraceWriter log)
{
log.Info("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
Uri collectionUri = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("ToDoItems", "Items");
string searchterm = req.GetQueryNameValuePairs()
.FirstOrDefault(q => string.Compare(q.Key, "searchterm", true) == 0)
.Value;
if (searchterm == null)
{
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
}
log.Info($"Searching for word: {searchterm} using Uri: {collectionUri.ToString()}");
IDocumentQuery<ToDoItem> query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<ToDoItem>(collectionUri)
.Where(p => p.Description.Contains(searchterm))
.AsDocumentQuery();
while (query.HasMoreResults)
{
foreach (ToDoItem result in await query.ExecuteNextAsync())
{
log.Info(result.Description);
}
}
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
}
}
}
```


## Input - attributes

In [in-process C# class libraries](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the [DocumentDB](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/v2.x/src/WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB/DocumentDBAttribute.cs) attribute.

The attribute's constructor takes the database name and collection name. For information about those settings and other properties that you can configure, see [the following configuration section](#input---configuration).

## Input - configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `DocumentDB`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `documentdb` . |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `in` . |
name |
n/a | Name of the binding parameter that represents the document in the function. |
databaseName |
DatabaseName |
The database containing the document. |
collectionName |
CollectionName |
The name of the collection that contains the document. |
id |
Id |
The ID of the document to retrieve. This property supports
id and sqlQuery properties. If you don't set either one, the entire collection is retrieved. |

**sqlQuery****SqlQuery**`SELECT * FROM c where c.departmentId = {departmentId}`

. Don't set both the **id**and**sqlQuery**properties. If you don't set either one, the entire collection is retrieved.**connection****ConnectionStringSetting****partitionKey****PartitionKey**When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Input - usage

When the function exits successfully, any changes made to the input document via named input parameters are automatically persisted.

## Output

The Azure Cosmos DB output binding lets you write a new document to an Azure Cosmos DB database using the SQL API.

## Output - example

This section contains the following examples:

- Queue trigger, write one doc
- Queue trigger, write docs using
`IAsyncCollector`


The examples refer to a simple `ToDoItem`

type:

```
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public class ToDoItem
{
public string Id { get; set; }
public string Description { get; set; }
}
}
```


### Queue trigger, write one doc

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a document to a database, using data provided in message from Queue storage.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{
public static class WriteOneDoc
{
[FunctionName("WriteOneDoc")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("todoqueueforwrite")] string queueMessage,
[DocumentDB(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
collectionName: "Items",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection")]out dynamic document,
TraceWriter log)
{
document = new { Description = queueMessage, id = Guid.NewGuid() };
log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function inserted one row");
log.Info($"Description={queueMessage}");
}
}
}
```


### Queue trigger, write docs using IAsyncCollector

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a collection of documents to a database, using data provided in a queue message JSON.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace CosmosDBSamplesV1
{

## Output - attributes

In [in-process C# class libraries](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the [DocumentDB](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/v2.x/src/WebJobs.Extensions.DocumentDB/DocumentDBAttribute.cs) attribute.

The attribute's constructor takes the database name and collection name. For information about those settings and other properties that you can configure, see [Output - configuration](#output---configuration). Here's a `DocumentDB`

attribute example in a method signature:

```
[FunctionName("QueueToDocDB")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("myqueue-items", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")] string myQueueItem,
[DocumentDB("ToDoList", "Items", Id = "id", ConnectionStringSetting = "myCosmosDB")] out dynamic document)
{
...
}
```


For a complete example, see [Output](#output).

## Output - configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `DocumentDB`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `documentdb` . |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `out` . |
name |
n/a | Name of the binding parameter that represents the document in the function. |
databaseName |
DatabaseName |
The database containing the collection where the document is created. |
collectionName |
CollectionName |
The name of the collection where the document is created. |
createIfNotExists |
CreateIfNotExists |
A boolean value to indicate whether the collection is created when it doesn't exist. The default is false because new collections are created with reserved throughput, which has cost implications. For more information, see the
|
partitionKey |
PartitionKey |
When `CreateIfNotExists` is true, defines the partition key path for the created collection. |
collectionThroughput |
CollectionThroughput |
When `CreateIfNotExists` is true, defines the
|
connection |
ConnectionStringSetting |
The name of the app setting containing your Azure Cosmos DB connection string. |

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Output - usage

By default, when you write to the output parameter in your function, a document is created in your database. This document has an automatically generated GUID as the document ID. You can specify the document ID of the output document by specifying the `id`

property in the JSON object passed to the output parameter.

Note

When you specify the ID of an existing document, it gets overwritten by the new output document.

## Exceptions and return codes

# Quickstart: Create a function in Azure from the command line

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you use local command-line tools to create a function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying your code locally, you deploy it to a serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

[Java 17 Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)- If you use another
[supported version of Java](supported-languages?pivots=programming-language-java#languages-by-runtime-version), you must update the project's pom.xml file. - The
`JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

- If you use another
[Apache Maven 3.8.x](https://maven.apache.org)

The

, used to parse JSON output, and is also available in Azure Cloud Shell.`jq`

command line JSON processor

## Install the Azure Functions Core Tools

The recommended way to install Core Tools depends on the operating system of your local development computer.

The following steps use a Windows installer (MSI) to install Core Tools v4.x. For more information about other package-based installers, see the [Core Tools readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/blob/v4.x/README.md#windows).

Download and run the Core Tools installer, based on your version of Windows:

[v4.x - Windows 64-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174087)(Recommended.[Visual Studio Code debugging](functions-develop-vs-code#debugging-functions-locally)requires 64-bit.)[v4.x - Windows 32-bit](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174159)

If you previously used Windows installer (MSI) to install Core Tools on Windows, you should uninstall the old version from Add Remove Programs before installing the latest version.

Tip

To install Core Tools on [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](/en-us/windows/wsl/install), follow the instructions on the Linux tab.

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Make sure to use one of the [Python versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions) supported by Azure Functions.

```
python -m venv .venv
```


```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment.

## Create a local code project and function

In Azure Functions, your code project is an app that contains one or more individual functions that each respond to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same configurations and are deployed as a unit to Azure. In this section, you create a code project that contains a single function.

In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated`


In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript`


In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime powershell`


In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime python`


In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript`


In a terminal or command prompt, run this

command to create a function app project in the current folder:`func init`

`func init --worker-runtime custom`


In an empty folder, run this

`mvn`

command to generate the code project from an Azure Functions[Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html):`mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=17`

Important

- Use
`-DjavaVersion=11`

if you want your functions to run on Java 11. To learn more, see[Java versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions). - Set the
`JAVA_HOME`

environment variable to the install location of the correct version of the JDK to complete this article.

- Use
Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment.


Provide the following values when prompted:Prompt Value Description **groupId**`com.fabrikam`

A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the [package naming rules](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se6/html/packages.html#7.7)for Java.**artifactId**`fabrikam-functions`

A value that is the name of the jar, without a version number. **version**`1.0-SNAPSHOT`

Choose the default value. **package**`com.fabrikam`

A value that is the Java package for the generated function code. Use the default. Type

`Y`

or press Enter to confirm.Maven creates the project files in a new folder with a name of

*artifactId*, which in this example is`fabrikam-functions`

.Navigate into the project folder:

`cd fabrikam-functions`

You can review the template-generated code for your new HTTP trigger function in

*Function.java*in the*\src\main\java\com\fabrikam*project directory.

Use this

command to add a function to your project:`func new`

`func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "function"`

A new code file is added to your project. In this case, the

`--name`

argument is the unique name of your function (`HttpExample`

) and the`--template`

argument specifies an HTTP trigger.

The project root folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named [local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) and [host.json](functions-host-json). Because *local.settings.json* can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the *.gitignore* file.

## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Verify your new function by running the project locally and calling the function endpoint.

Use this command to start the local Azure Functions runtime host in the root of the project folder:

`func start`

`npm install npm start`

`mvn clean package mvn azure-functions:run`

Toward the end of the output, the following lines appear:

... Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7071 Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down. Http Functions: HttpExample: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample ...

Copy the URL of your

`HttpExample`

function from this output to a browser and browse to the function URL. You should receive a success response with a "hello world" message.Note

Because access key authorization isn't enforced when running locally, the function URL returned doesn't include the access key value and you don't need it to call your function.

When you're done, use

**Ctrl**+**C**and choose`y`

to stop the functions host.

## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your function code to Azure, you need to create these resources:

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A default
[Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your functions. - A
[user-assigned managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview), which the Functions host uses to connect to the default storage account. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app maps to your local function project and lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources.

Use the Azure CLI commands in these steps to create the required resources.

If you haven't done so already, sign in to Azure:

`az login`

The

command signs you into your Azure account. Skip this step when running in Azure Cloud Shell.`az login`

If you haven't already done so, use this

command to install the Application Insights extension:`az extension add`

`az extension add --name application-insights`

Use this

[az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)command to create a resource group named`AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg`

in your chosen region:`az group create --name "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --location "<REGION>"`

In this example, replace

`<REGION>`

with a region near you that supports the Flex Consumption plan. Use the[az functionapp list-flexconsumption-locations](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-list-flexconsumption-locations)command to view the list of currently supported regions.Use this

[az storage account create](/en-us/cli/azure/storage/account#az-storage-account-create)command to create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region:`az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location "<REGION>" --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" \ --sku "Standard_LRS" --allow-blob-public-access false --allow-shared-key-access false`

In this example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Names must contain three to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only.`Standard_LRS`

specifies a general-purpose account, which is[supported by Functions](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements). This new account can only be accessed by using Microsoft Entra-authenticated identities that have been granted permissions to specific resources.Use this script to create a user-assigned managed identity, parse the returned JSON properties of the object using

`jq`

, and grant`Storage Blob Data Owner`

permissions in the default storage account:`output=$(az identity create --name "func-host-storage-user" --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --location <REGION> \ --query "{userId:id, principalId: principalId, clientId: clientId}" -o json) userId=$(echo $output | jq -r '.userId') principalId=$(echo $output | jq -r '.principalId') clientId=$(echo $output | jq -r '.clientId') storageId=$(az storage account show --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <STORAGE_NAME> --query 'id' -o tsv) az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $principalId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \ --role "Storage Blob Data Owner" --scope $storageId`

If you don't have the

`jq`

utility in your local Bash shell, it's available in Azure Cloud Shell. In this example, replace`<STORAGE_NAME>`

and`<REGION>`

with your default storage account name and region, respectively.The

[az identity create](/en-us/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create)command creates an identity named`func-host-storage-user`

. The returned`principalId`

is used to assign permissions to this new identity in the default storage account by using thecommand. The`az role assignment create`

command is used to obtain the storage account ID.`az storage account show`

Use this

[az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create)command to create the function app in Azure:`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime dotnet-isolated --runtime-version <LANGUAGE_VERSION> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime java --runtime-version <LANGUAGE_VERSION> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime node --runtime-version <LANGUAGE_VERSION> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime python --runtime-version <LANGUAGE_VERSION> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime python --runtime-version <LANGUAGE_VERSION> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

`az functionapp create --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --name <APP_NAME> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> \ --runtime other --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> \ --deployment-storage-auth-type UserAssignedIdentity --deployment-storage-auth-value "func-host-storage-user"`

In this example, replace these placeholders with the appropriate values:

`<APP_NAME>`

: a globally unique name appropriate to you. The`<APP_NAME>`

is also the default DNS domain for the function app.`<STORAGE_NAME>`

: the name of the account you used in the previous step.`<REGION>`

: your current region.`<LANGUAGE_VERSION>`

: use the same[supported language stack version](supported-languages)you verified locally, when applicable.

This command creates a function app running in your specified language runtime on Linux in the

[Flex Consumption Plan](flex-consumption-plan), which is free for the amount of usage you incur here. The command also creates an associated Azure Application Insights instance in the same resource group, with which you can use to monitor your function app executions and view logs. For more information, see[Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring). The instance incurs no costs until you activate it.Use this script to add your user-assigned managed identity to the

[Monitoring Metrics Publisher](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/monitor#monitoring-metrics-publisher)role in your Application Insights instance:`appInsights=$(az monitor app-insights component show --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" \ --app <APP_NAME> --query "id" --output tsv) principalId=$(az identity show --name "func-host-storage-user" --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" \ --query principalId -o tsv) az role assignment create --role "Monitoring Metrics Publisher" --assignee $principalId --scope $appInsights`

In this example, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app. The[az role assignment create](/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create)command adds your user to the role. The resource ID of your Application Insights instance and the principal ID of your user are obtained by using the[az monitor app-insights component show](/en-us/cli/azure/monitor/app-insights/component#az-monitor-app-insights-component-show)andcommands, respectively.`az identity show`


## Update application settings

To enable the Functions host to connect to the default storage account by using shared secrets, replace the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection string setting with several settings that are prefixed with `AzureWebJobsStorage__`

. These settings define a complex setting that your app uses to connect to storage and Application Insights with a user-assigned managed identity.

Use this script to get the client ID of the user-assigned managed identity and uses it to define managed identity connections to both storage and Application Insights:

`clientId=$(az identity show --name func-host-storage-user \ --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg --query 'clientId' -o tsv) az functionapp config appsettings set --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" \ --settings AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName=<STORAGE_NAME> \ AzureWebJobsStorage__credential=managedidentity AzureWebJobsStorage__clientId=$clientId \ APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_AUTHENTICATION_STRING="ClientId=$clientId;Authorization=AAD"`

In this script, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

and`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the names of your function app and storage account, respectively.Run the

[az functionapp config appsettings delete](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-delete)command to remove the existing`AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection string setting, which contains a shared secret key:`az functionapp config appsettings delete --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group "AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg" --setting-names AzureWebJobsStorage`

In this example, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the names of your function app.

At this point, the Functions host can connect to the storage account securely by using managed identities instead of shared secrets. You can now deploy your project code to the Azure resources.

## Deploy the function project to Azure

After you've successfully created your function app in Azure, you're now ready to deploy your local functions project by using the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local#project-file-deployment) command.

In your root project folder, run this

command:`func azure functionapp publish`

`func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>`

In this example, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your app. A successful deployment shows results similar to the following output (truncated for simplicity):... Getting site publishing info... Creating archive for current directory... Performing remote build for functions project. ... Deployment successful. Remote build succeeded! Syncing triggers... Functions in msdocs-azurefunctions-qs: HttpExample - [httpTrigger] Invoke url: https://msdocs-azurefunctions-qs.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this command to get the URL endpoint value, including the access key:

`func azure functionapp list-functions <APP_NAME> --show-keys`

In this example, again replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your app.Copy the returned endpoint URL and key, which you use to invoke the function endpoint.


## Update the pom.xml file

After you successfully create your function app in Azure, update the pom.xml file so that Maven can deploy to your new app. Otherwise, Maven creates a new set of Azure resources during deployment.

In Azure Cloud Shell, use this

command to get the deployment container URL and ID of the new user-assigned managed identity:`az functionapp show`

`az functionapp show --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg \ --query "{userAssignedIdentityResourceId: properties.functionAppConfig.deployment.storage.authentication.userAssignedIdentityResourceId, \ containerUrl: properties.functionAppConfig.deployment.storage.value}"`

In this example, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the names of your function app.In the project root directory, open the pom.xml file in a text editor, locate the

`properties`

element, and update these specific property values:Property name Value `java.version`

Use the same [supported language stack version](supported-languages)you verified locally, such as`17`

.`azure.functions.maven.plugin.version`

`1.37.1`

`azure.functions.java.library.version`

`3.1.0`

`functionAppName`

The name of your function app in Azure. Find the

`configuration`

section of the`azure-functions-maven-plugin`

and replace it with this XML fragment:`<configuration> <appName>${functionAppName}</appName> <resourceGroup>AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg</resourceGroup> <pricingTier>Flex Consumption</pricingTier> <region>....</region> <runtime> <os>linux</os> <javaVersion>${java.version}</javaVersion> </runtime> <deploymentStorageAccount>...</deploymentStorageAccount> <deploymentStorageResourceGroup>AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg</deploymentStorageResourceGroup> <deploymentStorageContainer>...</deploymentStorageContainer> <storageAuthenticationMethod>UserAssignedIdentity</storageAuthenticationMethod> <userAssignedIdentityResourceId>...</userAssignedIdentityResourceId> <appSettings> <property> <name>FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION</name> <value>~4</value> </property> </appSettings> </configuration>`

In the new

`configuration`

element, make these specific replacements of the ellipses (`...`

) values:Configuration Value `region`

The region code of your existing function app, such as `eastus`

.`deploymentStorageAccount`

The name of your storage account. `deploymentStorageContainer`

The name of the deployment share, which comes after the `\`

in the`containerUrl`

value you obtained.`userAssignedIdentityResourceId`

The fully qualified resource ID of your managed identity, which you obtained. Save your changes to the

*pom.xml*file.

You can now use Maven to deploy your code project to your existing app.

## Deploy the function project to Azure

From the command prompt, run this command:

`mvn clean package azure-functions:deploy`

After your deployment succeeds, run this Core Tools command to get the URL endpoint value, including the access key:

`func azure functionapp list-functions <APP_NAME> --show-keys`

In this example, again replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your app.Copy the returned endpoint URL and key, which you use to invoke the function endpoint.


## Invoke the function on Azure

Because your function uses an HTTP trigger and supports GET requests, you invoke it by making an HTTP request to its URL using the function-level access key. It's easiest to execute a GET request in a browser.

Paste the URL and access key you copied into a browser address bar.

The endpoint URL should look something like this example:

`https://contoso-app.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample?code=aabbccdd...`


In this case, you must also provide an access key in the query string when making a GET request to the endpoint URL. Using an access key is recommended to limit access from random clients. When making a POST request using an HTTP client, you should instead provide the access key in the `x-functions-key`

header.

When you navigate to this URL, the browser should display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

## Clean up resources

If you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue output binding, keep all your resources in place as you'll build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```

# Web PubSub bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to authenticate, send real-time messages to clients connected to [Azure Web PubSub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/web-pubsub/) by using Azure Web PubSub bindings in Azure Functions.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Handle client events from Web PubSub |
|

[Input binding](functions-bindings-web-pubsub-input)[Output binding](functions-bindings-web-pubsub-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.WebPubSub/).

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

Note

The Web PubSub extensions for Java is not supported yet.

## Key concepts

(1)-(2) `WebPubSubConnection`

input binding with HttpTrigger to generate client connection.

(3)-(4) `WebPubSubTrigger`

trigger binding or `WebPubSubContext`

input binding with HttpTrigger to handle service request.

(5)-(6) `WebPubSub`

output binding to request service do something.

## Connection

You can use [connection string](#connection-string) or [Microsoft Entra identity](#identity-based-connections) to connect to Azure Web PubSub service.

### Connection String

By default, an application setting named `WebPubSubConnectionString`

is used to store your Web PubSub connection string. When you choose to use a different setting name for your connection, you must explicitly set that as the key name in your binding definitions. During local development, you must also add this setting to the `Values`

collection in the [ local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file).

Important

A connection string includes the authorization information required for your application to access Azure Web PubSub service. The access key inside the connection string is similar to a root password for your service. For optimal security, your function app should use [managed identities](#identity-based-connections) when connecting to the Web PubSub service instead of using a connection string.

For details on how to configure and use Web PubSub and Azure Functions together, refer to [Tutorial: Create a serverless notification app with Azure Functions and Azure Web PubSub service](../azure-web-pubsub/tutorial-serverless-notification).

### Identity-based connections

If you're using Azure Web PubSub Functions Extensions v1.10.0 or higher, instead of using a connection string with an access key, you can configure your function app to authenticate to Azure Web PubSub using a Microsoft Entra identity.

This approach removes the need to manage secrets and is recommended for production workloads.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure the Microsoft Entra identity used by your function app has been granted an appropriate Azure RBAC role on the target Web PubSub resource:

#### Configuration

Identity-based connections in Azure Functions use a set of settings that share a common prefix. By default, Azure Web PubSub Functions extensions look for settings with the prefix `WebPubSubConnectionString`

. You can customize this prefix by setting the `connection`

property in your trigger or binding.

For Azure Web PubSub, the service-specific setting you must provide is the service endpoint URI:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service URI | `WebPubSubConnectionString__serviceUri` |
The URI of your Web PubSub service endpoint. | Yes |

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified. For more information on how to customize the identity, [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Example configuration

The following example shows how to configure identity-based with default settings:

```
{
"WebPubSubConnectionString__serviceUri": "https://your-webpubsub.webpubsub.azure.com"
}
```


Note

When using `local.settings.json`

file at local, [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp), or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for identity-based connections, replace `__`

with `:`

in the setting name to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `WebPubSubConnectionString:serviceUri`

.

# Dapr Secret input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr secret input binding allows you to read secrets data as input during function execution.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("RetrieveSecret")]
public static void Run(
[DaprServiceInvocationTrigger] object args,
[DaprSecret("kubernetes", "my-secret", Metadata = "metadata.namespace=default")] IDictionary<string, string> secret,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.");
}
```


The following example creates a `"RetrieveSecret"`

function using the `DaprSecretInput`

binding with the [ DaprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke):

```
@FunctionName("RetrieveSecret")
public void run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "RetrieveSecret") Object args,
@DaprSecretInput(
secretStoreName = "kubernetes",
key = "my-secret",
metadata = "metadata.namespace=default")
Map<String, String> secret,
final ExecutionContext context)
```


In the following example, the Dapr secret input binding is paired with a Dapr invoke trigger, which is registered by the `app`

object:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('RetrieveSecret', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'daprServiceInvocationTrigger',
name: "payload"
}),
extraInputs: [daprSecretInput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.");
const daprSecretInputValue = context.extraInputs.get(daprSecretInput);
// print the fetched secret value
for (var key in daprSecretInputValue) {
context.log(`Stored secret: Key=${key}, Value=${daprSecretInputValue[key]}`);
}
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings":
{
"type": "daprSecret",
"direction": "in",
"name": "secret",
"key": "my-secret",
"secretStoreName": "localsecretstore",
"metadata": "metadata.namespace=default"
}
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload, $secret
)
# PowerShell function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a RetrieveSecretLocal request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $secret | ConvertTo-Json
Write-Host "$jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr Secret input binding, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprSecret`

binding alongside the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveSecret")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveSecret")
@app.dapr_secret_input(arg_name="secret", secret_store_name="localsecretstore", key="my-secret", metadata="metadata.namespace=default")
def main(payload, secret: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveSecret --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveSecret request from the Dapr Runtime.')
secret_dict = json.loads(secret)
for key in secret_dict:
logging.info("Stored secret: Key = " + key +
', Value = ' + secret_dict[key])
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprSecret`

to define a Dapr secret input binding, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
SecretStoreName |
The name of the secret store to get the secret. |
Key |
The key identifying the name of the secret to get. |
Metadata |
Optional. An array of metadata properties in the form `"key1=value1&key2=value2"` . |

## Annotations

# Monitor executions in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure Functions](functions-overview) offers built-in integration with Azure Application Insights to monitor functions executions. This article provides an overview of the monitoring capabilities provided by Azure for monitoring Azure Functions.

Application Insights collects log, performance, and error data. By automatically detecting performance anomalies and featuring powerful analytics tools, you can more easily diagnose issues and better understand how your functions are used. These tools are designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability of your functions. You can even use Application Insights during local function app project development. For more information, see [Introduction to Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

As Application Insights instrumentation is built into Azure Functions, you need a valid instrumentation key to connect your function app to an Application Insights resource. The instrumentation key is added to your application settings as you create your function app resource in Azure. If your function app doesn't already have this key, you can [set it manually](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration).

You can also monitor the function app itself by using Azure Monitor. To learn more, see [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions).

## Application Insights pricing and limits

You can try out Application Insights integration with Azure Functions for free featuring a daily limit to how much data is processed for free.

If you enable Applications Insights during development, you might hit this limit during testing. Azure provides portal and email notifications when you're approaching your daily limit. If you miss those alerts and hit the limit, new logs don't appear in Application Insights queries. Be aware of the limit to avoid unnecessary troubleshooting time. For more information, see [Application Insights billing](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs#application-insights-billing).

Important

Application Insights has a [sampling](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling) feature that can protect you from producing too much telemetry data on completed executions at times of peak load. Sampling is enabled by default. If you appear to be missing data, you might need to adjust the sampling settings to fit your particular monitoring scenario. To learn more, see [Configure sampling](configure-monitoring#configure-sampling).

## Application Insights integration

Typically, you create an Application Insights instance when you create your function app. In this case, the instrumentation key required for the integration is already set as an application setting named `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`

. If for some reason your function app doesn't have the instrumentation key set, you need to [enable Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration).

Important

Sovereign clouds, such as Azure Government, require the use of the Application Insights connection string (`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`

) instead of the instrumentation key. To learn more, see the [APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING reference](functions-app-settings#applicationinsights_connection_string).

The following table details the supported features of Application Insights available for monitoring your function apps:

| Azure Functions runtime version | 1.x | 4.x+ |
|---|---|---|
Automatic collection of |
||
| • Requests | ✓ | ✓ |
| • Exceptions | ✓ | ✓ |
| • Performance Counters | ✓ | ✓ |

| • Event Hubs | Yes | |
Configurable |
||
| •
|

* To enable the collection of SQL query string text, see [Enable SQL query collection](configure-monitoring#enable-sql-query-collection).

## Collecting telemetry data

With Application Insights integration enabled, telemetry data is sent to your connected Application Insights instance. This data includes logs generated by the Functions host, traces written from your functions code, and performance data.

Note

In addition to data from your functions and the Functions host, you can also collect data from the [Functions scale controller](#scale-controller-logs).

### Log levels and categories

When you write traces from your application code, you should assign a log level to the traces. Log levels provide a way for you to limit the amount of data that is collected from your traces.

A *log level* is assigned to every log. The value is an integer that indicates relative importance:

| LogLevel | Code | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Trace | 0 | Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages might contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment. |
| Debug | 1 | Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value. |
| Information | 2 | Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value. |
| Warning | 3 | Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but don't otherwise cause the application execution to stop. |
| Error | 4 | Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped because of a failure. These errors should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. |
| Critical | 5 | Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. |
| None | 6 | Disables logging for the specified category. |

The [ host.json file](functions-host-json) configuration determines how much logging a functions app sends to Application Insights.

To learn more about log levels, see [Configure log levels](configure-monitoring#configure-log-levels).

By assigning logged items to a category, you have more control over telemetry generated from specific sources in your function app. Categories make it easier to run analytics over collected data. Traces written from your function code are assigned to individual categories based on the function name. To learn more about categories, see [Configure categories](configure-monitoring#configure-categories).

### Custom telemetry data

In [C#](functions-dotnet-class-library#log-custom-telemetry-in-c-functions), [JavaScript](functions-reference-node#track-custom-data), and [Python](functions-reference-python#logging-and-monitoring), you can use an Application Insights SDK to write custom telemetry data.

### Dependencies

Starting with version 2.x of Functions, Application Insights automatically collects data on dependencies for bindings that use certain client SDKs. Application Insights collects data on the following dependencies:

- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Service Bus
- Azure Storage services (Blob, Queue, and Table)

HTTP requests and database calls using `SqlClient`

are also captured. For the complete list of dependencies supported by Application Insights, see [automatically tracked dependencies](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/asp-net-dependencies#automatically-tracked-dependencies).

Application Insights generates an *application map* of collected dependency data. The following is an example of an application map of an HTTP trigger function with a Queue storage output binding.


Dependencies are written at the `Information`

level. If you filter at `Warning`

or above, you don't see the dependency data. Also, automatic collection of dependencies happens at a non-user scope. To capture dependency data, make sure the level is set to at least `Information`

outside the user scope (`Function.<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>.User`

) in your host.

In addition to automatic dependency data collection, you can also use one of the language-specific Application Insights SDKs to write custom dependency information to the logs. For an example how to write custom dependencies, see one of the following language-specific examples:

[Log custom telemetry in C# functions](functions-dotnet-class-library#log-custom-telemetry-in-c-functions)[Log custom telemetry in JavaScript functions](functions-reference-node#track-custom-data)[Log custom telemetry in Python functions](functions-reference-python#logging-and-monitoring)

### Performance Counters

Automatic collection of Performance Counters isn't supported when running on Linux.

## Writing to logs

The way that you write to logs and the APIs you use depend on the language of your function app project. See the developer guide for your language to learn more about writing logs from your functions.

## Analyze data

By default, the data collected from your function app is stored in Application Insights. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Application Insights provides an extensive set of visualizations of your telemetry data. You can drill into error logs and query events and metrics. To learn more, including basic examples of how to view and query your collected data, see [Analyze Azure Functions telemetry in Application Insights](analyze-telemetry-data).

## Streaming Logs

While developing an application, you often want to see what's being written to the logs in near real time when running in Azure.

There are two ways to view a stream of the log data being generated by your function executions.

**Built-in log streaming**: the App Service platform lets you view a stream of your application log files. This stream is equivalent to the output seen when you debug your functions during[local development](functions-develop-local)and when you use the**Test**tab in the portal. All log-based information is displayed. For more information, see[Stream logs](../app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs#stream-logs). This streaming method supports only a single instance, and can't be used with an app running on Linux in a Consumption plan.**Live Metrics Stream**: when your function app is[connected to Application Insights](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration), you can view log data and other metrics in near real time in the Azure portal using[Live Metrics Stream](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream). Use this method when monitoring functions running on multiple-instances or on Linux in a Consumption plan. This method uses[sampled data](configure-monitoring#configure-sampling).

Log streams can be viewed both in the portal and in most local development environments. To learn how to enable log streams, see [Enable streaming execution logs in Azure Functions](streaming-logs).

## Diagnostic logs

Application Insights lets you export telemetry data to long-term storage or other analysis services.

Because Functions also integrates with Azure Monitor, you can also use diagnostic settings to send telemetry data to various destinations, including Azure Monitor logs. To learn more, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitor-log-analytics).

## Scale controller logs

The [Azure Functions scale controller](event-driven-scaling#runtime-scaling) monitors instances of the Azure Functions host on which your app runs. This controller makes decisions about when to add or remove instances based on current performance. You can have the scale controller emit logs to Application Insights to better understand the decisions the scale controller is making for your function app. You can also store the generated logs in Blob storage for analysis by another service.

To enable this feature, you add an application setting named `SCALE_CONTROLLER_LOGGING_ENABLED`

to your function app settings. To learn how, see [Configure scale controller logs](configure-monitoring#configure-scale-controller-logs).

## Azure Monitor metrics

In addition to log-based telemetry data collected by Application Insights, you can also get data about how the function app is running from [Azure Monitor Metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). To learn more, see [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions).

## Report issues

To report an issue with Application Insights integration in Functions, or to make a suggestion or request, [create an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues/new).

# Securing Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Service](../app-service/) provides the hosting infrastructure for your function apps. This article provides security strategies for running your function code, and how App Service can help you secure your functions.

Azure App Service actively secures and hardens its platform components, including Azure virtual machines (VMs), storage, network connections, web frameworks, and management and integration features. App Service undergoes continuous, rigorous compliance checks to ensure that:

[Each app is segregated from other Azure apps and resources](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Web-App-sandbox).[Regular updates of VMs and runtime software](/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-patch-os-runtime)address newly discovered vulnerabilities.- Communication of secrets and connection strings between apps and other Azure resources like
[Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)occurs only within Azure, without crossing any network boundaries. Stored secrets are always encrypted. - All communications over App Service connectivity features like
[Hybrid Connection](/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections)are encrypted. - All connections via remote management tools like Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure SDKs, and REST APIs are encrypted.
- Continuous threat management protects the infrastructure and platform against malware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and man-in-the-middle attacks, and other threats.

For more information on infrastructure and platform security in Azure, see the [Azure Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

For a set of security recommendations that follow the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/introduction), see [Azure Security Baseline for Azure Functions](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/functions-security-baseline).

While planning for secure development, deployment, and operation of serverless functions is much the same as for any web-based or cloud-hosted application, serverless applications are likely vulnerable to variations of traditional attacks. To learn more about potential attacks on serverless infrastructure, see the [OWASP Top 10: Serverless Interpretation](https://owasp.org/www-project-serverless-top-10/).

## Secure operation

This section guides you on configuring and running your function app as securely as possible.

### Defender for Cloud

Defender for Cloud integrates with your function app in the portal. It provides a quick assessment of potential configuration-related security vulnerabilities. Function apps running in a dedicated plan can also use Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features for an extra cost. For more information, see [Defender for App Service](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-app-service-introduction).

### Log and monitor

One way to detect attacks is through activity monitoring and logging analytics. Functions integrates with Application Insights to collect log, performance, and error data for your function app. Application Insights automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and understand how your functions are used. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

Functions also integrates with Azure Monitor Logs to enable you to consolidate function app logs with system events for easier analysis. You can use diagnostic settings to configure the streaming export of platform logs and metrics for your functions to the destination of your choice, such as a Logs Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Functions with Azure Monitor Logs](functions-monitor-log-analytics).

For enterprise-level threat detection and response automation, stream your logs and events to a Logs Analytics workspace. You can then connect Microsoft Sentinel to this workspace. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Sentinel](../sentinel/overview).

For more security recommendations for observability, see the [Azure security baseline for Azure Functions](security-baseline#logging-and-monitoring).

### Secure HTTP endpoints

HTTP endpoints that you expose publicly provide a vector of attack for malicious actors. When securing your HTTP endpoints, use a layered security approach. Use these techniques to reduce the vulnerability of publicly exposed HTTP endpoints, ordered from most basic to most secure and restrictive:

[Require HTTPS](#require-https)[Require access keys](#function-access-keys)[Enable App Service Authentication/Authorization](#enable-app-service-authenticationauthorization)[Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests](#use-azure-api-management-apim-to-authenticate-requests)[Deploy your function app to a virtual network](#deploy-your-function-app-to-a-virtual-network)[Deploy your function app in isolation](#deploy-your-function-app-in-isolation)

### Require HTTPS

By default, clients can connect to function endpoints by using either HTTP or HTTPS. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS because HTTPS uses the TLS protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated. To learn how, see [Enforce HTTPS](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-https).

When you require HTTPS, also require the latest TLS version. To learn how, see [Enforce TLS versions](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-tls-versions).

For more information, see [Secure connections (TLS)](../app-service/overview-security#https-and-certificates).

### Function access keys

Functions uses keys to make it harder to access your function endpoints. Unless you set the HTTP access level on an HTTP triggered function to `anonymous`

, requests must include an access key in the request. For more information, see [Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to).

While access keys can help prevent unwanted access, the only way to truly secure your function endpoints is by implementing positive authentication of clients accessing your functions. You can then make authorization decisions based on identity.

For the highest level of security, secure the entire application architecture inside a virtual network [using private endpoints](#deploy-your-function-app-to-a-virtual-network) or by [running in isolation](#deploy-your-function-app-in-isolation).

### Disable administrative endpoints

Function apps can serve administrative endpoints under the `/admin`

route. You can use these endpoints for operations such as obtaining host status information and performing test invocations. When exposed, requests against these endpoints must include the app's master key. You can also access administrative operations through the [Azure Resource Manager Microsoft.Web/sites API](/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps), which offers Azure RBAC. To disable the

`/admin`

endpoints, set the `functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled`

site property in your app to `true`

. For more information, see the [functionsRuntimeAdminIsolationEnabled](functions-app-settings#functionsruntimeadminisolationenabled)property reference.

### Enable App Service Authentication/Authorization

The App Service platform lets you use Microsoft Entra ID and several non-Microsoft identity providers to authenticate clients. Use this strategy to implement custom authorization rules for your functions. You can work with user information from your function code. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) and [Working with client identities](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#working-with-client-identities).

### Use Azure API Management (APIM) to authenticate requests

APIM provides various API security options for incoming requests. For more information, see [API Management authentication policies](../api-management/api-management-policies#authentication-and-authorization). By using APIM, you can configure your function app to accept requests only from the IP address of your APIM instance. For more information, see [IP address restrictions](ip-addresses#ip-address-restrictions).

### Permissions

As with any application or service, run your function app with the lowest possible permissions.

#### User management permissions

Functions supports built-in [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview). Azure roles supported by Functions are [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), and [Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader).

Permissions take effect at the function app level. The Contributor role is required to perform most function app-level tasks. You also need the Contributor role along with the [Monitoring Reader permission](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security#monitoring-reader) to view log data in Application Insights. Only the Owner role can delete a function app.

#### Organize functions by privilege

Connection strings and other credentials stored in application settings give all of the functions in the function app the same set of permissions in the associated resource. Consider minimizing the number of functions with access to specific credentials by moving functions that don't use those credentials to a separate function app. You can always use techniques such as [function chaining](/en-us/training/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/) to pass data between functions in different function apps.

#### Managed identities

A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows your app to easily access other Microsoft Entra-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. The Azure platform manages the identity, so you don't need to provision or rotate any secrets. For more information about managed identities in Microsoft Entra ID, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

You can grant two types of identities to your application:

- A
*system-assigned identity*is tied to the app and is deleted if the app is deleted. An app can have only one system-assigned identity. - A
*user-assigned identity*is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your app. An app can have multiple user-assigned identities. One user-assigned identity can be assigned to multiple Azure resources, such as two App Service apps.

Use managed identities instead of secrets for connections from some triggers and bindings. See [Identity-based connections](#identity-based-connections).

For more information, see [Use managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

#### Restrict CORS access

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is a way to allow web apps running in another domain to make requests to your HTTP trigger endpoints. App Service provides built-in support for handling the required CORS headers in HTTP requests. CORS rules are defined on a function app level.

It's tempting to use a wildcard that allows all sites to access your endpoint. This approach defeats the purpose of CORS, which is to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks. Instead, add a separate CORS entry for the domain of each web app that must access your endpoint.

### Managing secrets

To connect to the various services and resources needed to run your code, function apps need access to secrets, such as connection strings and service keys. This section describes how to store secrets required by your functions.

Never store secrets in your function code.

#### Application settings

By default, store connection strings and secrets used by your function app and bindings as application settings. This approach makes these credentials available to both your function code and the various bindings used by the function. Use the application setting (key) name to retrieve the actual value, which is the secret.

For example, every function app requires an associated storage account, which the runtime uses. By default, you store the connection to this storage account in an application setting named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

Azure encrypts app settings and connection strings. The app settings and connection strings are decrypted only before being injected into your app's process memory when the app starts. The encryption keys are rotated regularly. If you prefer to manage the secure storage of your secrets, make the app settings references to Azure Key Vault secrets.

When developing functions on your local computer, you can also encrypt settings by default in the `local.settings.json`

file. For more information, see [Encrypt the local settings file](functions-run-local#encrypt-the-local-settings-file).

#### Key Vault references

While application settings are sufficient for most functions, you might want to share the same secrets across multiple services. In this case, redundant storage of secrets results in more potential vulnerabilities. A more secure approach is to use a central secret storage service and use references to this service instead of the secrets themselves.

[Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history. You can use a Key Vault reference in the place of a connection string or key in your application settings. For more information, see [Use Key Vault references for App Service and Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

### Identity-based connections

Use identities in place of secrets for connecting to some resources. This approach has the advantage of not requiring the management of a secret, and it provides more fine-grained access control and auditing.

When you write code that creates the connection to [Azure services that support Microsoft Entra authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-support-managed-identities#services-supporting-managed-identities), you can use an identity instead of a secret or connection string. Details for both connection methods are covered in the documentation for each service.

You can configure some Azure Functions binding extensions to access services by using identity-based connections. For more information, see [Configure an identity-based connection](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

### Set usage quotas

Consider setting a usage quota for functions running in a Consumption plan. When you set a daily GB-sec limit on the total execution of functions in your function app, execution stops when the limit is reached. This approach could potentially help protect against malicious code executing your functions. To learn how to estimate consumption for your functions, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

### Data validation

The triggers and bindings used by your functions don't provide any extra data validation. Your code must validate any data received from a trigger or input binding. If an upstream service is compromised, you don't want unvalidated inputs flowing through your functions. For example, if your function stores data from an Azure Storage queue in a relational database, you must validate the data and parameterize your commands to avoid SQL injection attacks.

Don't assume that the data coming into your function is already validated or sanitized. It's also a good idea to verify that the data being written to output bindings is valid.

### Handle errors

While it seems basic, it's important to write good error handling in your functions. Unhandled errors bubble up to the host, and the runtime handles these errors. Different bindings handle the processing of errors differently. For more information, see [Azure Functions error handling](functions-bindings-error-pages).

### Disable remote debugging

Make sure that remote debugging is disabled, except when you're actively debugging your functions. You can disable remote debugging in the **General Settings** tab of your function app **Configuration** in the portal.

### Restrict CORS access

Azure Functions supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). CORS is configured [in the portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#cors) and through the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/cors). The CORS allowed origins list applies at the function app level. With CORS enabled, responses include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header. For more information, see [Cross-origin resource sharing](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#cors).

Don't use wildcards in your allowed origins list. Instead, list the specific domains from which you expect to get requests.

### Store data encrypted

Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. For more information, see [Azure Storage encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption).

By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For more control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys to use for encryption of blob and file data. These keys must be present in Azure Key Vault for Functions to be able to access the storage account. To learn more, see [Encrypt your application data at rest using customer-managed keys](configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk).

### Secure related resources

A function app frequently depends on other resources, so part of securing the app is securing these external resources. At a minimum, most function apps include a dependency on Application Insights and Azure Storage. For guidance on securing these resources, consult the [Azure security baseline for Azure Monitor](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/azure-monitor-security-baseline) and the [Azure security baseline for Storage](/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/storage-security-baseline).

Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

You should also consult the guidance for any resource types your application logic depends on, both as triggers and bindings and from your function code.

## Secure deployment

Azure Functions tooling integration makes it easy to publish local function project code to Azure. It's important to understand how deployment works when considering security for an Azure Functions topology.

### Deployment credentials

App Service deployments require a set of deployment credentials. You use these deployment credentials to secure your function app deployments. The App Service platform manages deployment credentials and encrypts them at rest.

There are two kinds of deployment credentials:

**User-scope**or user-level credentials provide one set of deployment credentials for a user's entire Azure account. A user who is granted app access via role-based access control (RBAC) or coadministrator permissions can use their user-level credentials as long as they have those permissions.You can use your user-scope credentials to deploy any app to App Service via local Git or FTP/S in any subscription that your Azure account has permission to access. You don't share these credentials with any other Azure users. You can reset your user-scope credentials anytime.

**App-scope**or application-level credentials are one set of credentials per app that can be used to deploy that app only. These credentials are generated automatically for each app at creation and can't be configured manually, but the password can be reset anytime.A user must have at least

**Contributor**level permissions on an app, including the built-in**Website Contributor**role, to be granted access to app-level credentials via RBAC.**Reader**role can't publish and can't access these credentials.

At this time, Key Vault isn't supported for deployment credentials. To learn more about managing deployment credentials, see [Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service](../app-service/deploy-configure-credentials).

### Disable FTP

By default, each function app has an FTP endpoint enabled. The FTP endpoint is accessed using deployment credentials.

FTP isn't recommended for deploying your function code. FTP deployments are manual, and they require you to synchronize triggers. For more information, see [FTP deployment](functions-deployment-technologies#ftps).

When you're not using FTP, keep it disabled. You can change this setting in the portal. If you do choose to use FTP, [enforce FTPS](../app-service/deploy-ftp#enforce-ftps).

### Secure the `scm`

endpoint

Each function app has a corresponding `scm`

service endpoint that the Advanced Tools (Kudu) service uses for deployments and other App Service [site extensions](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-Site-Extensions). The `scm`

endpoint for a function app is always a URL in the form `https://<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.scm.azurewebsites.net`

. When you use network isolation to secure your functions, you must also account for this endpoint.

By using a separate `scm`

endpoint, you can control deployments and other Advanced Tools functionalities for function apps that are isolated or running in a virtual network. The `scm`

endpoint supports both basic authentication (by using deployment credentials) and single sign-on with your Azure portal credentials. For more information, see [Accessing the Kudu service](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-the-kudu-service).

### Continuous security validation

Because you need to consider security at every step in the development process, it makes sense to also implement security validations in a continuous deployment environment. This approach is sometimes called *DevSecOps*. By using Azure DevOps for your deployment pipeline, you can integrate validation into the deployment process. For more information, see [Secure your Azure Pipelines](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/security/overview).

## Network security

By restricting network access to your function app, you can control who can access your functions endpoints. Functions uses App Service infrastructure to enable your functions to access resources without using internet-routable addresses or to restrict internet access to a function endpoint. To learn more about these networking options, see [Azure Functions networking options](functions-networking-options).

### Set access restrictions

Access restrictions allow you to define lists of allow and deny rules to control traffic to your app. Rules are evaluated in priority order. If you don't define any rules, your app accepts traffic from any address. For more information, see [Azure App Service access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

### Secure the storage account

When you create a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. You can replace this storage account with one that is secured by a virtual network with access enabled by service endpoints or private endpoints. For more information, see [Restrict your storage account to a virtual network](functions-networking-options#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Deploy your function app to a virtual network

[Azure Private Endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview) is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network.

You can use Private Endpoint for your functions hosted in the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans.

If you want to make calls to Private Endpoints, then you must make sure that your DNS lookups resolve to the private endpoint. You can enforce this behavior in one of the following ways:

- Integrate with Azure DNS private zones. When your virtual network doesn't have a custom DNS server, this is done automatically.
- Manage the private endpoint in the DNS server used by your app. To manage a private endpoint, you must know the endpoint address and use an A record to reference the endpoint you're trying to reach.
- Configure your own DNS server to forward to
[Azure DNS private zones](../dns/private-dns-privatednszone).

To learn more, see [using Private Endpoints for Web Apps](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

### Deploy your function app in isolation

Azure App Service Environment provides a dedicated hosting environment in which to run your functions. These environments let you configure a single front-end gateway that you can use to authenticate all incoming requests. For more information, see [Integrate your ILB App Service Environment with the Azure Application Gateway](../app-service/environment/integrate-with-application-gateway).

### Use a gateway service

By using gateway services such as [Azure Application Gateway](../application-gateway/overview) and [Azure Front Door](../frontdoor/front-door-overview), you can set up a Web Application Firewall (WAF). WAF rules monitor or block detected attacks, which provides an extra layer of protection for your functions. To set up a WAF, your function app needs to run in an ASE or use Private Endpoints (preview). For more information, see [Using private endpoints](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).
