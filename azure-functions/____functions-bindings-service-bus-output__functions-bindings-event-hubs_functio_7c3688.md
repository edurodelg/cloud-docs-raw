# Azure Service Bus output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Azure Service Bus output binding to send queue or topic messages.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-service-bus).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This code defines and initializes the `ILogger`

:

```
private readonly ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> _logger;
public ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions(ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
```


This example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that receives a message and writes it to a second queue:

```
[Function(nameof(ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction))]
[ServiceBusOutput("outputQueue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction(
[ServiceBusTrigger("queue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")] ServiceBusReceivedMessage message)
{
_logger.LogInformation("Message ID: {id}", message.MessageId);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Body: {body}", message.Body);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Content-Type: {contentType}", message.ContentType);
var outputMessage = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return outputMessage;
}
```


This example uses an HTTP trigger with an `OutputType`

object to both send an HTTP response and write the output message.

```
[Function("HttpSendMsg")]
public async Task<OutputType> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req, FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# HTTP trigger function processed a request for {context.InvocationId}.");
HttpResponseData response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
await response.WriteStringAsync("HTTP response: Message sent");
return new OutputType()
{
OutputEvent = "MyMessage",
HttpResponse = response
};
}
```


This code defines the multiple output type `OutputType`

, which includes the Service Bus output binding definition on `OutputEvent`

:

```
public class OutputType
{
[ServiceBusOutput("TopicOrQueueName", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string OutputEvent { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that sends a message to a Service Bus queue `myqueue`

when triggered by an HTTP request.

```
@FunctionName("httpToServiceBusQueue")
@ServiceBusQueueOutput(name = "message", queueName = "myqueue", connection = "AzureServiceBusConnection")
public String pushToQueue(
@HttpTrigger(name = "request", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
final String message,
@HttpOutput(name = "response") final OutputBinding<T> result ) {
result.setValue(message + " has been sent.");
return message;
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@QueueOutput`

annotation on function parameters whose value would be written to a Service Bus queue. The parameter type should be `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is any native Java type of a plan old Java object (POJO).

Java functions can also write to a Service Bus topic. The following example uses the `@ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotation to describe the configuration for the output binding.

```
@FunctionName("sbtopicsend")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@ServiceBusTopicOutput(name = "message", topicName = "mytopicname", subscriptionName = "mysubscription", connection = "ServiceBusConnection") OutputBinding<String> message,
final ExecutionContext context) {
String name = request.getBody().orElse("Azure Functions");
message.setValue(name);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
import { app, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const serviceBusOutput = output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: serviceBusOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a Service Bus output binding in a *function.json* file and a [PowerShell function](functions-reference-powershell) that uses the binding.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "serviceBus",
"direction": "out",
"connection": "AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
"name": "outputSbMsg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"topicName": "outtopic"
}
]
}
```


Here's the PowerShell that creates a message as the function's output.

```
param($QueueItem, $TriggerMetadata)
Push-OutputBinding -Name outputSbMsg -Value @{
name = $QueueItem.name
employeeId = $QueueItem.employeeId
address = $QueueItem.address
}
```


The following example demonstrates how to write out to a Service Bus topics and Service Bus queues in Python. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus topic.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_topic_output(arg_name="message",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
topic_name="outTopic")
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, message: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
input_msg = req.params.get('message')
message.set(input_msg)
return 'OK'
```


This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus queue.

```
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_queue_output(
arg_name="msg",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
queue_name="outqueue")
def put_message(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out[str]):
msg.set(req.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
return 'OK'
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the output binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#service-bus-output).

In [C# class libraries](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), use the [ServiceBusOutputAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/src/ServiceBusOutputAttribute.cs) to define the queue or topic written to by the output.

The following table explains the properties you can set using the attribute:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
EntityType |
Sets the entity type as either `Queue` for sending messages to a queue or `Topic` when sending messages to a topic. |
QueueOrTopicName |
Name of the topic or queue to send messages to. Use `EntityType` to set the destination type. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `service_bus_topic_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. |
`queue_name` |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
`topic_name` |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The `ServiceBusQueueOutput`

and `ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotations are available to write a message as a function output. The parameter decorated with these annotations must be declared as an `OutputBinding<T>`

where `T`

is the type corresponding to the message's type.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusQueue()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
queueName |
Name of the queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusTopic()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
topicName |
Name of the topic. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `ServiceBus`

attribute.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `serviceBus` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. Set to "$return" to reference the function return value. |
queueName |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
topicName |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

**accessRights**(v1 only)`manage`

and `listen`

. The default is `manage`

, which indicates that the `connection`

has the **Manage**permission. If you use a connection string that doesn't have the**Manage**permission, set`accessRights`

to "listen". Otherwise, the Functions runtime might fail trying to do operations that require manage rights. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, this property isn't available because the latest version of the Service Bus SDK doesn't support manage operations.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

All C# modalities and extension versions support the following output parameter types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|
Use when the message to write is simple text. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
byte[] |
Use for writing binary data messages. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
Object |
When a message contains JSON, Functions serializes the object into a JSON message payload. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions creates a message with a null object. |

Messaging-specific parameter types contain extra message metadata and aren't compatible with JSON serialization. As a result, it isn't possible to use `ServiceBusMessage`

with the output binding in the isolated model. The specific types supported by the output binding depend on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single message, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the message. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing multiple message. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [ServiceBusClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

In Azure Functions 1.x, the runtime creates the queue if it doesn't exist and you have set `accessRights`

to `manage`

. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, the queue or topic must already exist; if you specify a queue or topic that doesn't exist, the function fails.

Use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

Output to the Service Bus is available via the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet where you pass arguments that match the name designated by binding's name parameter in the *function.json* file.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[str]`

or `func.Out[bytes]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.
Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

For a complete example, see [the examples section](#example).

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Service Bus. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Get the management credentials](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues#get-the-connection-string). The connection string must be for a Service Bus namespace, not limited to a specific queue or topic.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyServiceBus", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyServiceBus". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Service Bus connection string in the app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsServiceBus".

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-service-bus?extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Service Bus namespace. | <service_bus_namespace>.servicebus.windows.net |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You'll need to create a role assignment that provides access to your topics and queues at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Service Bus extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
Trigger1 |
|

[Azure Service Bus Data Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-service-bus-data-sender)1 For triggering from Service Bus topics, the role assignment needs to have effective scope over the Service Bus subscription resource. If only the topic is included, an error will occur. Some clients, such as the Azure portal, don't expose the Service Bus subscription resource as a scope for role assignment. In such cases, the Azure CLI may be used instead. To learn more, see [Azure built-in roles for Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity#resource-scope).

# Azure Event Hubs trigger and bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) bindings for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and output bindings for Event Hubs.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Respond to events sent to an event hub event stream. |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs), version 6.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following options:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs] is in preview.

**Event Hubs trigger**

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Event Hubs output binding**

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure EventHub are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for EventHub Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python) to get started with SDK Types for Event Hubs in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| EventHub trigger |
|

`EventData`

## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control behavior for the Event Hubs trigger. The configuration is different depending on the extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"eventHubs": {
"maxEventBatchSize" : 100,
"minEventBatchSize" : 25,
"maxWaitTime" : "00:05:00",
"batchCheckpointFrequency" : 1,
"prefetchCount" : 300,
"transportType" : "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy" : "https://proxyserver:8080",
"customEndpointAddress" : "amqps://company.gateway.local",
"targetUnprocessedEventThreshold" : 75,
"initialOffsetOptions" : {
"type" : "fromStart",
"enqueuedTimeUtc" : ""
},
"clientRetryOptions":{
"mode" : "exponential",
"tryTimeout" : "00:01:00",
"delay" : "00:00:00.80",
"maximumDelay" : "00:01:00",
"maximumRetries" : 3
}
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
maxEventBatchSize2 |
100 | The maximum number of events included in a batch for a single invocation. Must be at least 1. |
minEventBatchSize1 |
1 | The minimum number of events desired in a batch. The minimum applies only when the function is receiving multiple events and must be less than `maxEventBatchSize` .The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the `maxWaitTime` has elapsed. Partial batches are also likely for the first invocation of the function after scaling takes place. |
maxWaitTime1 |
00:01:00 | The maximum interval that the trigger should wait to fill a batch before invoking the function. The wait time is only considered when `minEventBatchSize` is larger than 1 and is otherwise ignored. If less than `minEventBatchSize` events were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 10 minutes.NOTE: This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision. When scaling takes place, the first invocation with a partial batch may occur more quickly or may take up to twice the configured wait time. |
| batchCheckpointFrequency | 1 | The number of batches to process before creating a checkpoint for the event hub.NOTE: Setting this value above 1 for hosting plans supported by
|
| prefetchCount | 300 | The number of events that is eagerly requested from Event Hubs and held in a local cache to allow reads to avoid waiting on a network operation |
| transportType | amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Event Hubs. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
| webProxy | null | The proxy to use for communicating with Event Hubs over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
| customEndpointAddress | null | The address to use when establishing a connection to Event Hubs, allowing network requests to be routed through an application gateway or other path needed for the host environment. The fully qualified namespace for the event hub is still needed when a custom endpoint address is used, and it must be specified explicitly or via the connection string. |
targetUnprocessedEventThreshold1 |
null | The desired number of unprocessed events per function instance. The threshold is used in target-based scaling to override the default scaling threshold inferred from the `maxEventBatchSize` option. When set, the total unprocessed event count is divided by this value to determine the number of function instances needed. The instance count is rounded up to a number that creates a balanced partition distribution. |
| initialOffsetOptions/type | fromStart | The location in the event stream to start processing when a checkpoint does not exist in storage. Applies to all partitions. For more information, see the
`fromStart` , `fromEnd` , `fromEnqueuedTime` |

`initialOffsetOptions/type`

is configured as `fromEnqueuedTime`

, this setting is mandatory. Supports time in any format supported by [DateTime.Parse()](/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime), such as`2020-10-26T20:31Z`

. For clarity, you should also specify a timezone. When timezone isn't specified, Functions assumes the local timezone of the machine running the function app, which is UTC when running on Azure.`exponential`

, `fixed`

1 Using `minEventBatchSize`

and `maxWaitTime`

requires [v5.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/5.3.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package, or a later version.

2 The default `maxEventBatchSize`

changed in [v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/6.0.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package. In earlier versions, this was 10.

The `clientRetryOptions`

are used to retry operations between the Functions host and Event Hubs (such as fetching events and sending events). Refer to guidance on [Azure Functions error handling and retries](functions-bindings-error-pages#retries) for information on applying retry policies to individual functions.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to work with Azure Functions bindings for IoT Hub. The IoT Hub support is based on the [Azure Event Hubs Binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Important

While the following code samples use the Event Hub API, the given syntax is applicable for IoT Hub functions.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Respond to events sent to an IoT hub event stream. |
|

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs), version 6.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following options:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs] is in preview.

**Event Hubs trigger**

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Event Hubs output binding**

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure EventHub are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for EventHub Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python) to get started with SDK Types for Event Hubs in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| EventHub trigger |
|

`EventData`

## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control behavior for the Event Hubs trigger. The configuration is different depending on the extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"eventHubs": {
"maxEventBatchSize" : 100,
"minEventBatchSize" : 25,
"maxWaitTime" : "00:05:00",
"batchCheckpointFrequency" : 1,
"prefetchCount" : 300,
"transportType" : "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy" : "https://proxyserver:8080",
"customEndpointAddress" : "amqps://company.gateway.local",
"targetUnprocessedEventThreshold" : 75,
"initialOffsetOptions" : {
"type" : "fromStart",

"tryTimeout" : "00:01:00",
"delay" : "00:00:00.80",
"maximumDelay" : "00:01:00",
"maximumRetries" : 3
}
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
maxEventBatchSize2 |
100 | The maximum number of events included in a batch for a single invocation. Must be at least 1. |
minEventBatchSize1 |
1 | The minimum number of events desired in a batch. The minimum applies only when the function is receiving multiple events and must be less than `maxEventBatchSize` .The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the `maxWaitTime` has elapsed. Partial batches are also likely for the first invocation of the function after scaling takes place. |
maxWaitTime1 |
00:01:00 | The maximum interval that the trigger should wait to fill a batch before invoking the function. The wait time is only considered when `minEventBatchSize` is larger than 1 and is otherwise ignored. If less than `minEventBatchSize` events were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 10 minutes.NOTE: This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision. When scaling takes place, the first invocation with a partial batch may occur more quickly or may take up to twice the configured wait time. |
| batchCheckpointFrequency | 1 | The number of batches to process before creating a checkpoint for the event hub.NOTE: Setting this value above 1 for hosting plans supported by
|
| prefetchCount | 300 | The number of events that is eagerly requested from Event Hubs and held in a local cache to allow reads to avoid waiting on a network operation |
| transportType | amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Event Hubs. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
| webProxy | null | The proxy to use for communicating with Event Hubs over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
| customEndpointAddress | null | The address to use when establishing a connection to Event Hubs, allowing network requests to be routed through an application gateway or other path needed for the host environment. The fully qualified namespace for the event hub is still needed when a custom endpoint address is used, and it must be specified explicitly or via the connection string. |
targetUnprocessedEventThreshold1 |
null | The desired number of unprocessed events per function instance. The threshold is used in target-based scaling to override the default scaling threshold inferred from the `maxEventBatchSize` option. When set, the total unprocessed event count is divided by this value to determine the number of function instances needed. The instance count is rounded up to a number that creates a balanced partition distribution. |
| initialOffsetOptions/type | fromStart | The location in the event stream to start processing when a checkpoint does not exist in storage. Applies to all partitions. For more information, see the
`fromStart` , `fromEnd` , `fromEnqueuedTime` |

`initialOffsetOptions/type`

is configured as `fromEnqueuedTime`

. For clarity, you should also specify a timezone. When timezone isn't specified, Functions assumes the local timezone of the machine running the function app, which is UTC when running on Azure.`exponential`

, `fixed`

1 Using `minEventBatchSize`

and `maxWaitTime`

requires [v5.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/5.3.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package, or a later version.

# Azure Data Explorer output bindings for Azure Functions (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When a function runs, the Azure Data Explorer output binding ingests data to Azure Data Explorer.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer).

## Examples

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

More samples for the Azure Data Explorer output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-outofproc).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to `Product`

class and a corresponding database table:

```
public class Product
{
[JsonProperty(nameof(ProductID))]
public long ProductID { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Name))]
public string Name { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Cost))]
public double Cost { get; set; }
}
```


```
.create-merge table Products (ProductID:long, Name:string, Cost:double)
```


#### HTTP trigger, write one record

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a record to a database. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProduct
{
[Function("AddProduct")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products")]
public static async Task<Product> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductuni")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Product? prod = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Product>();
return prod ?? new Product { };
}
}
}
```


#### HTTP trigger, write records with mapping

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a collection of records to a database. The function uses mapping that transforms a `Product`

to `Item`

.

To transform data from `Product`

to `Item`

, the function uses a mapping reference:

```
.create-merge table Item (ItemID:long, ItemName:string, ItemCost:float)
-- Create a mapping that transforms an Item to a Product
.create-or-alter table Product ingestion json mapping "item_to_product_json" '[{"column":"ProductID","path":"$.ItemID"},{"column":"Name","path":"$.ItemName"},{"column":"Cost","path":"$.ItemCost"}]'
```


```
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common
{
public class Item
{
public long ItemID { get; set; }
public string? ItemName { get; set; }
public double ItemCost { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProductsWithMapping
{
[Function("AddProductsWithMapping")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products", MappingRef = "item_to_product_json")]
public static async Task<Item> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductswithmapping")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Item? item = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Item>();
return item ?? new Item { };
}
}
}
```


More samples for the Java Azure Data Explorer input binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-java).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a `Products`

class (in a separate file `Product.java`

) and a corresponding database table `Products`

(defined earlier):

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
public class Product {
@JsonProperty("ProductID")
public long ProductID;
@JsonProperty("Name")
public String Name;
@JsonProperty("Cost")
public double Cost;
public Product() {
}
public Product(long ProductID, String name, double Cost) {
this.ProductID = ProductID;
this.Name = name;
this.Cost = Cost;
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write a record to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds a product record to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
<version>2.13.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```


```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.outputbindings;

import com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common.Product;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Optional;
import static com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common.Constants.*;
public class AddProduct {
@FunctionName("AddProduct")
public HttpResponseMessage run(@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {
HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS, route = "addproductuni") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@KustoOutput(name = "product", database = "productsdb", tableName = "Products", connection = KUSTOCONNSTR) OutputBinding<Product> product)
throws IOException {
if (request.getBody().isPresent()) {
String json = request.getBody().get();
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Product p = mapper.readValue(json, Product.class);
product.setValue(p);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).header("Content-Type", "application/json").body(product)
.build();
} else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT).header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.build();
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Product`

and `ProductChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
<version>2.13.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```


The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


and Java class in `ProductsChangeLog.java`

:

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
public class ProductsChangeLog {
@JsonProperty("ProductID")
public long ProductID;
@JsonProperty("CreatedAt")
public String CreatedAt;
public ProductsChangeLog() {
}
public ProductsChangeLog(long ProductID, String CreatedAt) {
this.ProductID = ProductID;
this.CreatedAt = CreatedAt;
}
}
```

throws IOException {
if (request.getBody().isPresent()) {
String json = request.getBody().get();
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Product p = mapper.readValue(json, Product.class);
product.setValue(p);
productChangeLog.setValue(new ProductsChangeLog(p.ProductID, Instant.now(Clock.systemUTC()).toString()));
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).header("Content-Type", "application/json").body(product)
.build();
} else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT).header("Content-Type", "application/json")

### HTTP trigger, write records to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a JavaScript function that adds records to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

The following example is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"name": "req",
"direction": "in",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"methods": [
"post"
],

"type": "kusto",
"database": "productsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "Products",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample JavaScript code:

```
// Insert the product, which will insert it into the Products table.
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
// Note that this expects the body to be a JSON object or array of objects which have a property
// matching each of the columns in the table to insert to.
context.bindings.product = req.body;
return {
status: 201,
body: req.body
};
}
```

}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample Python code:

```
import azure.functions as func
from Common.product import Product
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, product: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
body = str(req.get_body(),'UTF-8')
product.set(body)
return func.HttpResponse(
body=body,
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a JavaScript function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Products`

and `ProductsChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


The following snippet is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"scriptFile": "__init__.py",
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "Anonymous",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "req",
"methods": [
"post"
],
"route": "addmultitable"
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "$return"
},
{
"name": "product",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "sdktestsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "Products",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
},
{
"name": "productchangelog",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "sdktestsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "ProductsChangeLog",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
}
]
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample Python code:

```
import json
from datetime import datetime
import azure.functions as func
from Common.product import Product
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, product: func.Out[str],productchangelog: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
body = str(req.get_body(),'UTF-8')
# parse x:
product.set(body)
id = json.loads(body)["ProductID"]
changelog = {
"ProductID": id,
"CreatedAt": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}
productchangelog.set(json.dumps(changelog))
return func.HttpResponse(
body=body,
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


## Attributes

The [C# library](functions-dotnet-class-library) uses the [KustoAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/src/KustoAttribute.cs) attribute to declare the Azure Data Explorer bindings on the function, which has the following properties.

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
| Database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| Connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| TableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| MappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Annotations

The [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime) uses the [ @KustoInput](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/java-library/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/kusto/annotation/KustoInput.java) annotation (

`com.microsoft.azure.functions.kusto.annotation.KustoOutput`

).| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
| type | Required. Must be set to `kusto` . |
| direction | Required. Must be set to `out` . |
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The attribute's constructor takes the database and the attributes `TableName`

, `MappingRef`

, and `DataFormat`

and the connection setting name. The KQL command can be a KQL statement or a KQL function. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json`

for local development) that contains the [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For example:`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId`

. Queries executed by the input binding are parameterized. The values provided in the KQL parameters are used at runtime.

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to Azure Data Explorer instead of using a connection string, which contains keys. For more information, see [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For mananaged identity-based connections, you must set the `managedServiceIdentity`

property in the binding definition.

# Create a function app in a local Linux container

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Azure Functions Core tools to create your first function in a Linux container on your local computer, verify the function locally, and then publish the containerized function to a container registry. From a container registry, you can easily deploy your containerized functions to Azure.

For a complete example of deploying containerized functions to Azure, which include the steps in this article, see one of the following articles:

[Create your first containerized Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-usage)[Create your first containerized Azure Functions](functions-deploy-container)

You can also create a function app in the Azure portal by using an existing containerized function app from a container registry. For more information, see [Azure portal create using containers](functions-how-to-custom-container#azure-portal-create-using-containers).

## Choose your development language

First, you use Azure Functions tools to create your project code as a function app in a Docker container using a language-specific Linux base image. Make sure to select your language of choice at the top of the article.

Core Tools automatically generates a Dockerfile for your project that uses the most up-to-date version of the correct base image for your functions language. You should regularly update your container from the latest base image and redeploy from the updated version of your container. For more information, see [Creating containerized function apps](functions-how-to-custom-container#creating-containerized-function-apps).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following requirements in place:

Install the

[.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).Install

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.0.5198, or a later version.

- Install
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.

- Install a version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-node#supported-versions).

- Install a version of Python that is
[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions).

- Install the
[.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Install a version of the

[Java Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-java#supported-versions).Install

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org)version 3.0 or above.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version 2.4 or a later version.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

To publish the containerized function app image you create to a container registry, you need a Docker ID and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) running on your local computer. If you don't have a Docker ID, you can [create a Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

You also need to complete the [Create a container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal#create-a-container-registry) section of the Container Registry quickstart to create a registry instance. Make a note of your fully qualified login server name.

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Make sure to use one of the [Python versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions) supported by Azure Functions.

```
python -m venv .venv
```


```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment.

## Create and test the local functions project

In a terminal or command prompt, run the following command for your chosen language to create a function app project in the current folder:

```
func init --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime powershell --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime python --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript --docker
```


In an empty folder, run the following command to generate the Functions project from a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=8 -Ddocker
```


The `-DjavaVersion`

parameter tells the Functions runtime which version of Java to use. Use `-DjavaVersion=11`

if you want your functions to run on Java 11. When you don't specify `-DjavaVersion`

, Maven defaults to Java 8. For more information, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions).

Important

The `JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the JDK to complete this article.

Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment. Follow the prompts and provide the following information:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
groupId |
`com.fabrikam` |
A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the
|

**artifactId**`fabrikam-functions`

**version**`1.0-SNAPSHOT`

**package**`com.fabrikam.functions`

Type `Y`

or press Enter to confirm.

Maven creates the project files in a new folder named *artifactId*, which in this example is `fabrikam-functions`

.

The `--docker`

option generates a *Dockerfile* for the project, which defines a suitable container for use with Azure Functions and the selected runtime.

Navigate into the project folder:

```
cd fabrikam-functions
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a C# code file in your project.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a configuration file named *function.json*.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


To test the function locally, start the local Azure Functions runtime host in the root of the project folder. To ensure the function can be called later when hosted in Docker, check that the authorization level is set to AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, or set it if not already configured.

```
func start
```


```
func start
```


```
npm install
npm start
```


```
mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```


After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to that endpoint. You should see a welcome message in the response output.

After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser must display a "hello" message that echoes back `Functions`

, the value supplied to the `name`

query parameter.

Press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop the host.

## Build the container image and verify locally

(Optional) Examine the *Dockerfile* in the root of the project folder. The *Dockerfile* describes the required environment to run the function app on Linux. The complete list of supported base images for Azure Functions can be found in the [Azure Functions base image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-base).

In the root project folder, run the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command, provide a name as `azurefunctionsimage`

, and tag as `v1.0.0`

. Replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker Hub account ID. This command builds the Docker image for the container.

```
docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .
```


When the command completes, you can run the new container locally.

To verify the build, run the image in a local container using the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command, replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

again with your Docker Hub account ID, and add the ports argument as `-p 8080:80`

:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -it <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```


After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample`

, which must display the same greeting message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

, which must display the same "hello" message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After verifying the function app in the container, press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop execution.

## Publish the container image to a registry

To make your container image available for deployment to a hosting environment, you must push it to a container registry. As a security best practice, you should use an Azure Container Registry instance and enforce managed identity-based connections. Docker Hub requires you to authenticate using shared secrets, which make your deployments more vulnerable.

Azure Container Registry is a private registry service for building, storing, and managing container images and related artifacts. You should use a private registry service for publishing your containers to Azure services.

Use this command to sign in to your registry instance using your current Azure credentials:

`az acr login --name <REGISTRY_NAME>`

In the previous command, replace

`<REGISTRY_NAME>`

with the name of your Container Registry instance.Use this command to tag your image with the fully qualified name of your registry login server:

`docker tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

Replace

`<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with the fully qualified name of your registry login server and`<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker ID.Use this command to push the container to your registry instance:

`docker push <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

# Azure Functions on Kubernetes with KEDA

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure Functions runtime provides flexibility in hosting where and how you want. [KEDA](https://keda.sh) (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling) pairs seamlessly with the Azure Functions runtime and tooling to provide event driven scale in Kubernetes.

Important

Running your containerized function apps on Kubernetes, either by using KEDA or by direct deployment, is an open-source effort that you can use free of cost. Best-effort support is provided by contributors and from the community by using [GitHub issues in the Azure Functions repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues). Please use these issues to report bugs and raise feature requests.

For fully-supported Kubernetes deployments, instead consider [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](../container-apps/functions-overview).

## How Kubernetes-based functions work

The Azure Functions service is made up of two key components: a runtime and a scale controller. The Functions runtime runs and executes your code. The runtime includes logic on how to trigger, log, and manage function executions. The Azure Functions runtime can run *anywhere*. The other component is a scale controller. The scale controller monitors the rate of events that are targeting your function, and proactively scales the number of instances running your app. To learn more, see [Azure Functions scale and hosting](functions-scale).

Kubernetes-based Functions provides the Functions runtime in a [Docker container](functions-create-container-registry) with event-driven scaling through KEDA. KEDA can scale in to zero instances (when no events are occurring) and out to *n* instances. It does this by exposing custom metrics for the Kubernetes autoscaler (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler). Using Functions containers with KEDA makes it possible to replicate serverless function capabilities in any Kubernetes cluster. These functions can also be deployed using [Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) virtual nodes](/en-us/azure/aks/virtual-nodes-cli) feature for serverless infrastructure.

## Managing KEDA and functions in Kubernetes

To run Functions on your Kubernetes cluster, you must install the KEDA component. You can install this component in one of the following ways:

Azure Functions Core Tools: using the

.`func kubernetes install`

commandHelm: there are various ways to install KEDA in any Kubernetes cluster, including Helm. Deployment options are documented on the

[KEDA site](https://keda.sh/docs/deploy/).

## Deploying a function app to Kubernetes

You can deploy any function app to a Kubernetes cluster running KEDA. Since your functions run in a Docker container, your project needs a Dockerfile. You can create a Dockerfile by using the [ --docker option](functions-core-tools-reference#func-init) when calling

`func init`

to create the project. If you forgot to create your Dockerfile, you can always call `func init`

again from the root of your code project.(Optional) If you need to create your Dockerfile, use the

command with the`func init`

`--docker-only`

option:`func init --docker-only`

To learn more about Dockerfile generation, see the

reference.`func init`

Use the

command to build your image and deploy your containerized function app to Kubernetes:`func kubernetes deploy`

`func kubernetes deploy --name <name-of-function-deployment> --registry <container-registry-username>`

In this example, replace

`<name-of-function-deployment>`

with the name of your function app. The deploy command performs these tasks:- The Dockerfile created earlier is used to build a local image for your containerized function app.
- The local image is tagged and pushed to the container registry where the user is logged in.
- A manifest is created and applied to the cluster that defines a Kubernetes
`Deployment`

resource, a`ScaledObject`

resource, and`Secrets`

, which includes environment variables imported from your`local.settings.json`

file.


### Deploying a function app from a private registry

The previous deployment steps work for private registries as well. If you're pulling your container image from a private registry, include the `--pull-secret`

flag that references the Kubernetes secret holding the private registry credentials when running `func kubernetes deploy`

.

## Removing a function app from Kubernetes

After deploying you can remove a function by removing the associated `Deployment`

, `ScaledObject`

, an `Secrets`

created.

```
kubectl delete deploy <name-of-function-deployment>
kubectl delete ScaledObject <name-of-function-deployment>
kubectl delete secret <name-of-function-deployment>
```


## Uninstalling KEDA from Kubernetes

You can remove KEDA from your cluster in one of the following ways:

Azure Functions Core Tools: using the

.`func kubernetes remove`

commandHelm: see the uninstall steps

[on the KEDA site](https://keda.sh/docs/deploy/).

## Supported triggers in KEDA

KEDA has support for the following Azure Function triggers:

### HTTP Trigger support

You can use Azure Functions that expose HTTP triggers, but KEDA doesn't directly manage them. You can use the KEDA prometheus trigger to [scale HTTP Azure Functions from one to n instances](https://dev.to/anirudhgarg_99/scale-up-and-down-a-http-triggered-function-app-in-kubernetes-using-keda-4m42).

# Dapr Service Invocation trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can be triggered on a Dapr service invocation using the following Dapr events.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("CreateNewOrder")]
public static void Run(
[DaprServiceInvocationTrigger] JObject payload,
[DaprState("%StateStoreName%", Key = "order")] out JToken order,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.");
// payload must be of the format { "data": { "value": "some value" } }
order = payload["data"];
}
```


Here's the Java code for the Dapr Service Invocation trigger:

```
@FunctionName("CreateNewOrder")
public String run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "CreateNewOrder")
)
```


Use the `app`

object to register the `daprInvokeOutput`

:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('InvokeOutputBinding', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'httpTrigger',
authLevel: 'anonymous',
methods: ['POST'],
route: "invoke/{appId}/{methodName}",
name: "req"
}),
return: daprInvokeOutput,
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
const payload = await request.text();
context.log(JSON.stringify(payload));
return { body: payload };
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "daprServiceInvocationTrigger",
"name": "payload",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload
)
# C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Payload must be of the format { "data": { "value": "some value" } }
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $payload| ConvertTo-Json
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name order -Value $payload["data"]
```


The following example shows a Dapr Service Invocation trigger, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_state_input(arg_name="data", state_store="statestore", key="order")
def main(payload, data: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveOrder --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.')
logging.info(data)
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Aspire](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) is an opinionated stack that simplifies development of distributed applications in the cloud. The integration of Aspire with Azure Functions enables you to develop, debug, and orchestrate an Azure Functions .NET project as part of the Aspire app host.

## Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for using Azure Functions with Aspire:

[Install the Aspire Prerequisites](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling#install-aspire-prerequisites).- Full support for the Azure Functions integration requires Aspire 13.1 or later. Aspire 13.0 also includes a preview version of
`Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions`

which acts as a release candidate with go-live support.

- Full support for the Azure Functions integration requires Aspire 13.1 or later. Aspire 13.0 also includes a preview version of
- Install the
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local).

If you use Visual Studio, update to version 17.12 or later. You must also have the latest version of the Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio. To check for updates:

- Go to
**Tools**>**Options**. - Under
**Projects and Solutions**, select**Azure Functions**. - Select
**Check for updates**and install updates as prompted.

## Solution structure

A solution that uses Azure Functions and Aspire has multiple projects, including an [app host project](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview) and one or more Functions projects.

The app host project is the entry point for your application. It orchestrates the setup of the components of your application, including the Functions project.

The solution typically also includes a *service defaults* project. This project provides a set of default services and configurations to be used across projects in your application.

### App host project

To successfully configure the integration, make sure that the app host project meets the following requirements:

- The app host project must reference
[Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions). This package defines the necessary logic for the integration. - The app host project needs to have a project reference for each Functions project that you want to include in the orchestration.
- In the app host's
`AppHost.cs`

file, you must include the project by calling`AddAzureFunctionsProject<TProject>()`

on your`IDistributedApplicationBuilder`

instance. You use this method instead of using the`AddProject<TProject>()`

method that you use for other project types in Aspire. If you use`AddProject<TProject>()`

, the Functions project can't start properly.

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project:

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject");
builder.Build().Run();
```


### Azure Functions project

To successfully configure the integration, make sure that the Azure Functions project meets the following requirements:

The Functions project must reference the

[2.x versions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#version-2x)of[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker/)and[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk/). You must also update any[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore/)references to the 2.x version.Your

`Program.cs`

file must use the`IHostApplicationBuilder`

version of the[host instance startup](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration). This requirement means that you must use`FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`

.If your solution includes a service defaults project, ensure that your Functions project is configured to use it:

- The Functions project should include a project reference to the service defaults project.
- Before you build
`IHostApplicationBuilder`

in`Program.cs`

, include a call to`builder.AddServiceDefaults()`

.


The following example shows a minimal `Program.cs`

file for a Functions project used in Aspire:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
var builder = FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
builder.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication();
builder.Build().Run();
```


This example doesn't include the default Application Insights configuration that appears in many other `Program.cs`

examples and in the Azure Functions templates. Instead, you configure OpenTelemetry integration in Aspire by calling the `builder.AddServiceDefaults`

method.

To get the most out of the integration, consider the following guidelines:

- Don't include any direct Application Insights integrations in the Functions project. Monitoring in Aspire is instead handled through its OpenTelemetry support. You can configure Aspire to export data to Azure Monitor through the service defaults project.
- Don't define custom app settings in the
`local.settings.json`

file for the Functions project. The only setting that should be in`local.settings.json`

is`"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"`

. Set all other app configurations through the app host project.

## Connection configuration with Aspire

The app host project defines resources and helps you create connections between them by using code. This section shows how to configure and customize connections that your Azure Functions project uses.

Aspire includes default connection permissions that can help you get started. However, these permissions might not be appropriate or sufficient for your application.

For scenarios that use Azure role-based access control (RBAC), you can customize permissions by calling the `WithRoleAssignments()`

method on the project resource. When you call `WithRoleAssignments()`

, all default role assignments are removed, and you must explicitly define the full set role assignments that you want. If you host your application on Azure Container Apps, using `WithRoleAssignments()`

also requires that you call `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment()`

on `DistributedApplicationBuilder`

.

### Azure Functions host storage

Azure Functions requires a [host storage connection ( AzureWebJobsStorage)](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity) for several of its core behaviors. When you call

`AddAzureFunctionsProject<TProject>()`

in your app host project, an `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection is created by default and provided to the Functions project. This default connection uses the Azure Storage emulator for local development runs and automatically provisions a storage account when it's deployed. For more control, you can replace this connection by calling `.WithHostStorage()`

on the Functions project resource.The default permissions that Aspire sets for the host storage connection depends on whether you call `WithHostStorage()`

or not. Adding `WithHostStorage()`

removes a [Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) assignment. The following table lists the default permissions that Aspire sets for the host storage connection:

| Host storage connection | Default roles |
|---|---|
No call to `WithHostStorage()` |
|

`WithHostStorage()`

[Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that replaces the host storage and specifies a role assignment:

```
using Azure.Provisioning.Storage;
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("myEnv");
var myHostStorage = builder.AddAzureStorage("myHostStorage");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithHostStorage(myHostStorage)
.WithRoleAssignments(myHostStorage, StorageBuiltInRole.StorageBlobDataOwner);
builder.Build().Run();
```


Note

[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) is the role that we recommend for the [basic needs of the host storage connection](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). Your app might encounter problems if the connection to the blob service has only the Aspire default of [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor).

For production scenarios, include calls to both `WithHostStorage()`

and `WithRoleAssignments()`

. You can then set this role explicitly, along with any others that you need.

### Trigger and binding connections

Your triggers and bindings reference connections by name. The following Aspire integrations provide these connections through a call to `WithReference()`

on the project resource:

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that configures a queue trigger. In this example, the corresponding queue trigger has its `Connection`

property set to `MyQueueTriggerConnection`

, so the call to `WithReference()`

specifies the name.

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var myAppStorage = builder.AddAzureStorage("myAppStorage").RunAsEmulator();
var queues = myAppStorage.AddQueues("queues");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithReference(queues, "MyQueueTriggerConnection");
builder.Build().Run();
```


For other integrations, calls to `WithReference`

set the configuration in a different way. They make the configuration available to [Aspire client integrations](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/integrations-overview#client-integrations), but not to triggers and bindings. For these integrations, call `WithEnvironment()`

to pass the connection information for the trigger or binding to resolve.

The following example shows how to set the environment variable `MyBindingConnection`

for a resource that exposes a connection string expression:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithEnvironment("MyBindingConnection", otherIntegration.Resource.ConnectionStringExpression);
```


If you want both Aspire client integrations and the system of triggers and bindings to use a connection, you can configure both `WithReference()`

and `WithEnvironment()`

.

For some resources, the structure of a connection might be different between when you run it locally and when you publish it to Azure. In the previous example, `otherIntegration`

could be a resource that runs as an emulator, so `ConnectionStringExpression`

would return an emulator connection string. However, when the resource is published, Aspire might set up an identity-based connection, and `ConnectionStringExpression`

would return the service's URI. In this case, to set up [identity-based connections for Azure Functions](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection), you might need to provide a different environment variable name.

The following example uses `builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode`

to conditionally add the necessary suffix:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithEnvironment("MyBindingConnection" + (builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode ? "__serviceUri" : ""), otherIntegration.Resource.ConnectionStringExpression);
```


For details on the connection formats that each binding supports, and the permissions that those formats require, consult the binding's [reference pages](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

## Hosting the application

Aspire supports two different ways to host your Functions project in Azure:

[Publish as a container app (default)](#publish-as-a-container-app)[Publish as a function app](#publish-as-a-function-app)using preview App Service integration

In both cases, your project is deployed as a container. Aspire takes care of building the container image for you and pushing it to Azure Container Registry.

### Publish as a container app

By default, when you publish an Aspire project to Azure, it's deployed to Azure Container Apps. The system sets up scaling rules for your Functions project using [KEDA](https://keda.sh/). When using Azure Container Apps, additional setup is needed for function keys. See [Access keys on Azure Container Apps](#access-keys-on-azure-container-apps) for more information.

#### Access keys on Azure Container Apps

Several Azure Functions scenarios use access keys to provide a basic mitigation against unwanted access. For example, HTTP trigger functions by default require an access key to be invoked, though this requirement can be disabled using the [ AuthLevel property](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#attributes). See

[Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to)for scenarios which may require a key.

When you deploy a Functions project using Aspire to Azure Container Apps, the system doesn't automatically create or manage Functions access keys. If you need to use access keys, you can manage them as part of your App Host setup. This section shows you how to create an extension method that you can call from your app host's `Program.cs`

file to create and manage access keys. This approach uses Azure Key Vault to store the keys and mounts them into the container app as secrets.

Note

The behavior here relies on the `ContainerApps`

secret provider, which is only available starting with Functions host version `4.1044.0`

. This version is not yet available in all regions, and until it is, when you publish your Aspire project, the base image used for the Functions project may not include the necessary changes.

These steps require Bicep version `0.38.3`

or later. You can check your Bicep version by running `bicep --version`

from a command prompt. If you have the Azure CLI installed, you can use `az bicep upgrade`

to quickly update Bicep to the latest version.

Add the following NuGet packages to your app host project:

Create a new class in your app host project and include the following code:

```
using Aspire.Hosting.Azure;
using Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers;
namespace Aspire.Hosting;
internal static class Extensions
{
private record SecretMapping(string OriginalName, IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference Reference);
public static IResourceBuilder<T> PublishWithContainerAppSecrets<T>(
this IResourceBuilder<T> builder,
IResourceBuilder<AzureKeyVaultResource>? keyVault = null,
string[]? hostKeyNames = null,
string[]? systemKeyExtensionNames = null)
where T : AzureFunctionsProjectResource
{
if (!builder.ApplicationBuilder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)
{
return builder;
}
keyVault ??= builder.ApplicationBuilder.AddAzureKeyVault("functions-keys");
var hostKeysToAdd = (hostKeyNames ?? []).Append("default").Select(k => $"host-function-{k}");
var systemKeysToAdd = systemKeyExtensionNames?.Select(k => $"host-systemKey-{k}_extension") ?? [];
var secrets = hostKeysToAdd.Union(systemKeysToAdd)
.Select(secretName => new SecretMapping(
secretName,
CreateSecretIfNotExists(builder.ApplicationBuilder, keyVault, secretName.Replace("_", "-"))
)).ToList();
return builder
.WithReference(keyVault)
.WithEnvironment("AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType", "ContainerApps")
.PublishAsAzureContainerApp((infra, app) => ConfigureFunctionsContainerApp(infra, app, builder.Resource, secrets));
}
private static void ConfigureFunctionsContainerApp(
AzureResourceInfrastructure infrastructure,
ContainerApp containerApp,
IResource resource,
List<SecretMapping> secrets)
{
const string volumeName = "functions-keys";
const string mountPath = "/run/secrets/functions-keys";
var appIdentityAnnotation = resource.Annotations.OfType<AppIdentityAnnotation>().Last();
var containerAppIdentityId = appIdentityAnnotation.IdentityResource.Id.AsProvisioningParameter(infrastructure);
var containerAppSecretsVolume = new ContainerAppVolume
{
Name = volumeName,
StorageType = ContainerAppStorageType.Secret
};
foreach (var mapping in secrets)
{
var secret = mapping.Reference.AsKeyVaultSecret(infrastructure);
containerApp.Configuration.Secrets.Add(new ContainerAppWritableSecret()
{
Name = mapping.Reference.SecretName.ToLowerInvariant(),
KeyVaultUri = secret.Properties.SecretUri,
Identity = containerAppIdentityId
});
containerAppSecretsVolume.Secrets.Add(new SecretVolumeItem
{
Path = mapping.OriginalName.Replace("-", "."),
SecretRef = mapping.Reference.SecretName.ToLowerInvariant()
});
}
containerApp.Template.Containers[0].Value!.VolumeMounts.Add(new ContainerAppVolumeMount
{
VolumeName = volumeName,
MountPath = mountPath
});
containerApp.Template.Volumes.Add(containerAppSecretsVolume);
}
public static IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference CreateSecretIfNotExists(
IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,
IResourceBuilder<AzureKeyVaultResource> keyVault,
string secretName)
{
var secretParameter = ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.CreateDefaultPasswordParameter(builder, $"param-{secretName}", special: false);
builder.AddBicepTemplateString($"key-vault-key-{secretName}", """
param location string = resourceGroup().location
param keyVaultName string
param secretName string
@secure()
param secretValue string
// Reference the existing Key Vault
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01' existing = {
name: keyVaultName
}
// Deploy the secret only if it does not already exist
@onlyIfNotExists()
resource newSecret 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2023-07-01' = {
parent: keyVault
name: secretName
properties: {
value: secretValue
}
}
""")
.WithParameter("keyVaultName", keyVault.GetOutput("name"))
.WithParameter("secretName", secretName)
.WithParameter("secretValue", secretParameter);
return keyVault.GetSecret(secretName);
}
}
```


You can then use this method in your app host's `Program.cs`

file:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithHostStorage(storage)
.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
.PublishWithContainerAppSecrets(systemKeyExtensionNames: ["mcp"]);
```


This example uses a default key vault created by the extension method. It results in a default key and a system key for use with the [Model Context Protocol extension](functions-bindings-mcp#connect-to-your-mcp-server).

To use these keys from clients, you need to retrieve them from the key vault.

### Publish as a function app

Note

Publishing as a function app requires the Aspire Azure App Service integration, which is currently in preview.

You can configure Aspire to deploy to a function app using the [Aspire Azure App Service integration](https://aspire.dev/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-functions). Because Aspire publishes the Functions project as a container, the hosting plan for your function app must support deploying containerized applications.

To publish your Aspire Functions project as a function app, follow these steps:

- Add a reference to the
[Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService)NuGet package in your app host project. - In the
`AppHost.cs`

file, call`AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment()`

on your`IDistributedApplicationBuilder`

instance to create an App Service plan. Note that despite the name, this does not provision an App Service Environment resource. - On the Functions project resource, call
`.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()`

. This is required for deploying with the Aspire Azure App Service integration. - On the Functions project resource, call
`.PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, app) => app.Kind = "functionapp,linux")`

to publish that project to the plan.

Important

Make sure that you set the `app.Kind`

property to `"functionapp,linux"`

. This setting ensures the resource is created as a function app, which affects experiences for working with your application.

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that publishes a Functions project as a function app:

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("functions-env");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
.PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, app) => app.Kind = "functionapp,linux");
```


This configuration creates a Premium V3 plan. When using a dedicated App Service plan SKU, scaling isn't event-based. Instead, scaling is managed through the App Service plan settings.

## Considerations and best practices

Consider the following points when you're evaluating the integration of Azure Functions with Aspire:

Trigger and binding configuration through Aspire is currently limited to specific integrations. For details, see

[Connection configuration with Aspire](#connection-configuration-with-aspire)in this article.Your function project's

`Program.cs`

file should use the`IHostApplicationBuilder`

version of[host instance startup](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration).`IHostApplicationBuilder`

allows you to call`builder.AddServiceDefaults()`

to add[Aspire service defaults](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/service-defaults)to your Functions project.Aspire uses OpenTelemetry for monitoring. You can configure Aspire to export data to Azure Monitor through the service defaults project.

In many other Azure Functions contexts, you might include direct integration with Application Insights by registering the worker service. We don't recommend this kind of integration in Aspire. It can lead to runtime errors with version 2.22.0 of

`Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService`

, though version 2.23.0 addresses this problem. When you're using Aspire, remove any direct Application Insights integrations from your Functions project.For Functions projects enlisted into a Aspire orchestration, most of the application configuration should come from the Aspire app host project. Avoid setting things in

`local.settings.json`

, other than the`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

setting. If you set the same environment variable in`local.settings.json`

and Aspire, the system uses the Aspire version.Don't configure the Azure Storage emulator for any connections in

`local.settings.json`

. Many Functions starter templates include the emulator as a default for`AzureWebJobsStorage`

. However, emulator configuration can prompt some developer tooling to start a version of the emulator that can conflict with the version that Aspire uses.

# Azure Event Hubs trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) trigger for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and [output bindings](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output) for Event Hubs.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Use the function trigger to respond to an event sent to an event hub event stream. You need read access to the underlying event hub to set up the trigger. When the function is triggered, the message passed to the function is typed as a string.

Event Hubs scaling decisions for the Consumption and Premium plans are done via Target Based Scaling. For more information, see [Target Based Scaling](functions-target-based-scaling).

For information about how Azure Functions responds to events sent to an event hub event stream using triggers, see [Integrate Event Hubs with serverless functions on Azure](/en-us/azure/architecture/serverless/event-hubs-functions/event-hubs-functions#consuming-events-with-azure-functions).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that is triggered based on an event hub, where the input message string is written to the logs:

```
{
private readonly ILogger<EventHubsFunction> _logger;
public EventHubsFunction(ILogger<EventHubsFunction> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
[Function(nameof(EventHubFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
[EventHubOutput("dest", Connection = "EventHubConnection")]
public string EventHubFunction(
[EventHubTrigger("src", Connection = "EventHubConnection")] string[] input,
FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation("First Event Hubs triggered message: {msg}", input[0]);
var message = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return message;
}
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript). The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message.

```
import { app, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function eventHubTrigger1(message: unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log('Event hub function processed message:', message);
context.log('EnqueuedTimeUtc =', context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtc);
context.log('SequenceNumber =', context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumber);
context.log('Offset =', context.triggerMetadata.offset);
}
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'one',
handler: eventHubTrigger1,
});
```


To receive events in a batch, set `cardinality`

to `many`

, as shown in the following example.

```
import { app, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function eventHubTrigger1(messages: unknown[], context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log(`Event hub function processed ${messages.length} messages`);
for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
context.log('Event hub message:', messages[i]);
context.log(`EnqueuedTimeUtc = ${context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtcArray[i]}`);
context.log(`SequenceNumber = ${context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumberArray[i]}`);
context.log(`Offset = ${context.triggerMetadata.offsetArray[i]}`);
}
}
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'many',
handler: eventHubTrigger1,
});
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node). The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'one',
handler: (message, context) => {
context.log('Event hub function processed message:', message);
context.log('EnqueuedTimeUtc =', context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtc);
context.log('SequenceNumber =', context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumber);
context.log('Offset =', context.triggerMetadata.offset);
},
});
```


To receive events in a batch, set `cardinality`

to `many`

, as shown in the following example.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'many',
handler: (messages, context) => {
context.log(`Event hub function processed ${messages.length} messages`);
for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
context.log('Event hub message:', messages[i]);
context.log(`EnqueuedTimeUtc = ${context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtcArray[i]}`);
context.log(`SequenceNumber = ${context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumberArray[i]}`);
context.log(`Offset = ${context.triggerMetadata.offsetArray[i]}`);
}
},
});
```


Here's the PowerShell code:

```
param($eventHubMessages, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "PowerShell eventhub trigger function called for message array: $eventHubMessages"
$eventHubMessages | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "Processed message: $_" }
```


This example uses SDK types to directly access the underlying [ EventData](/en-us/python/api/azure-eventhub/azure.eventhub.eventdata) object provided by the Event Hubs trigger:

The function reads the event body and logs it.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import azurefunctions.extensions.bindings.eventhub as eh
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
@app.event_hub_message_trigger(
arg_name="event", event_hub_name="EVENTHUB_NAME", connection="EventHubConnection"
)
def eventhub_trigger(event: eh.EventData):
logging.info(
"Python EventHub trigger processed an event %s",
event.body_as_str()
)
```


For examples of using the EventData type, see the [ EventData](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-eventhub/samples/eventhub_samples_eventdata/function_app.py) samples. For a step-by-step tutorial on how to include SDK-type bindings in your function app, follow the

[Python SDK Bindings for Event Hubs Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python).

Note

Known limitations include:

- The
`enqueued_time`

property is not supported. - Batch message support is supported with runtime version 4.1039 or greater.

To learn more, including what other SDK type bindings are supported, see [SDK type bindings](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="EventHubTrigger1")
@app.event_hub_message_trigger(arg_name="myhub",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def test_function(myhub: func.EventHubEvent):
logging.info('Python EventHub trigger processed an event: %s',
myhub.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger binding which logs the message body of the Event Hubs trigger.

```
@FunctionName("ehprocessor")
public void eventHubProcessor(
@EventHubTrigger(name = "msg",
eventHubName = "myeventhubname",
connection = "myconnvarname") String message,
final ExecutionContext context )
{
context.getLogger().info(message);
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `EventHubTrigger`

annotation on parameters whose value comes from the event hub. Parameters with these annotations cause the function to run when an event arrives. This annotation can be used with native Java types, POJOs, or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

.

The following example illustrates extensive use of `SystemProperties`

and other Binding options for further introspection of the Event along with providing a well-formed `BlobOutput`

path that is Date hierarchical.

```
package com.example;

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to configure the trigger. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#event-hubs-trigger).

Use the `EventHubTriggerAttribute`

to define a trigger on an event hub, which supports the following properties.

| Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
EventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. Can be referenced in
`%eventHubName%` |

**ConsumerGroup**[consumer group](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)used to subscribe to events in the hub. When omitted, the`$Default`

consumer group is used.**Connection**[Connections](#connections).## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `event_hub_message_trigger`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the event item in function code. |
`event_hub_name` |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [EventHubTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhubtrigger) annotation, which supports the following settings:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `app.eventHub()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
eventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. Can be referenced via
`%eventHubName%` |

**consumerGroup**[consumer group](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)used to subscribe to events in the hub. If omitted, the`$Default`

consumer group is used.**cardinality**`many`

in order to enable batching. If omitted or set to `one`

, a single message is passed to the function.**connection**[Connections](#connections).The following table explains the trigger configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, which differs by runtime version.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `eventHubTrigger` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `in` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |

## Usage

To learn more about how Event Hubs trigger and IoT Hub trigger scales, see [Consuming Events with Azure Functions](/en-us/azure/architecture/serverless/event-hubs-functions/event-hubs-functions#consuming-events-with-azure-functions).

Functions also supports Python SDK type bindings for Azure Event Hubs, which lets you work with data using these underlying SDK types:

Important

Support for Event Hubs SDK types in Python is in Preview and is only supported for the Python v2 programming model. For more information, see [SDK types in Python](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

The parameter type supported by the Event Hubs output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

The parameter type can be one of the following:

- Any native Java types such as int, String, byte[].
- Nullable values using Optional.
- Any POJO type.

To learn more, see the [EventHubTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhubtrigger) reference.

## Event metadata

The Event Hubs trigger provides several [metadata properties](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns). Metadata properties can be used as part of binding expressions in other bindings or as parameters in your code. The properties come from the [EventData](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.eventdata) class.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
`PartitionContext` |
|

`PartitionContext`

instance.`EnqueuedTimeUtc`

`DateTime`

`Offset`

`string`

`PartitionKey`

`string`

`Properties`

`IDictionary<String,Object>`

`SequenceNumber`

`Int64`

`SystemProperties`

`IDictionary<String,Object>`

See [code examples](#example) that use these properties earlier in this article.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Event Hubs. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

Obtain this connection string by clicking the **Connection Information** button for the [namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace), not the event hub itself. The connection string must be for an Event Hubs namespace, not the event hub itself.

When used for triggers, the connection string must have at least "read" permissions to activate the function. When used for output bindings, the connection string must have "send" permissions to send messages to the event stream.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-event-hubs?tabs=extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Event Hubs namespace. | `myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net` |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your event hub at runtime. The scope of the role assignment can be for an Event Hubs namespace, or the event hub itself. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Event Hubs extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
|

[Azure Event Hubs Data Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-event-hubs-data-sender)## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control Event Hubs trigger behavior. See the [host.json settings](functions-bindings-event-hubs#hostjson-settings) section for details regarding available settings.

# Azure Functions deployment slots

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions deployment slots allow your function app to run different instances called *slots*. Slots are different environments exposed by using a publicly available endpoint. One app instance is always mapped to the production slot, and you can swap instances assigned to a slot on demand.

The number of available slots depends on your specific hosting option:

| Hosting option | Slots (including production) |
|---|---|
|

[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan)[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)[1-20](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-app-service-limits)[Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview)[Revisions](../container-apps/revisions)The following descriptions reflect how functions are affected by swapping slots:

- Traffic redirection is seamless; no requests are dropped because of a swap. This seamless behavior occurs because the next function trigger is routed to the swapped slot.
- Currently executing function are terminated during the swap. To learn how to write stateless and defensive functions, see
[Improve the performance and reliability of Azure Functions](performance-reliability#write-functions-to-be-stateless).

## Why use slots?

There are many advantages to using deployment slots, including:

**Different environments for different purposes**: Using different slots gives you the opportunity to differentiate app instances before swapping to production or a staging slot.**Prewarming**: Deploying to a slot instead of directly to production allows the app to warm up before going live. Additionally, using slots reduces latency for HTTP-triggered workloads. Instances are warmed up before deployment, which reduces the cold start for newly deployed functions.**Easy fallbacks**: After a swap with production, the slot with a previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can immediately reverse the swap to get your "last known good instance" back.**Minimize restarts**: Changing app settings in a production slot requires a restart of the running app. You can instead change settings in a staging slot and swap the settings change into production with a prewarmed instance. Slots are the recommended way to migrate between Functions runtime versions while maintaining the highest availability. To learn more, see[Minimum downtime update](migrate-version-3-version-4#minimum-downtime-update).

## Swap operations

During a swap, one slot is considered the source and the other is the target. The source slot has the instance of the application that is applied to the target slot. The following steps ensure the target slot doesn't experience downtime during a swap:

**Apply settings:**Settings from the target slot are applied to all instances of the source slot. For example, the production settings are applied to the staging instance. The applied settings include the following categories:[Slot-specific](#manage-settings)app settings and connection strings (if applicable)[Continuous deployment](../app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment)settings (if enabled)[App Service authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)settings (if enabled)

**Wait for restarts and availability:**The swap waits for every instance in the source slot to complete its restart and to be available for requests. If any instance fails to restart, the swap operation reverts all changes to the source slot and stops the operation.**Update routing:**If all instances on the source slot are warmed up successfully, the two slots complete the swap by switching routing rules. After this step, the target slot (for example, the production slot) has the app that was previously warmed up in the source slot.**Repeat operation:**Now that the source slot has the preswap app previously in the target slot, complete the same operation by applying all settings and restarting the instances for the source slot.

Keep in mind the following points:

At any point of the swap operation, initialization of the swapped apps happens on the source slot. The target slot remains online while the source slot is prepared, whether the swap succeeds or fails.

To swap a staging slot with the production slot, make sure that the production slot is

*always*the target slot. This way, the swap operation doesn't affect your production app.Settings related to event sources and bindings must be configured as

[deployment slot settings](#manage-settings)*before you start a swap*. Marking them as "sticky" ahead of time ensures events and outputs are directed to the proper instance.When you create a new staging slot, all existing settings from the production slot are created in the new slot, regardless of the

*stickiness*of the setting.

## Manage settings

Some configuration settings are slot-specific. The following lists detail which settings change when you swap slots, and which remain the same.

**Slot-specific settings**:

- Publishing endpoints
- Custom domain names
- Nonpublic certificates and TLS/SSL settings
- Scale settings
- IP restrictions
- Always On
- Diagnostic settings
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
- Private endpoints

**Non slot-specific settings**:

- General settings, such as framework version, 32/64-bit, web sockets
- App settings (can be configured to stick to a slot)
- Connection strings (can be configured to stick to a slot)
- Handler mappings
- Public certificates
- Hybrid connections *
- Virtual network integration *
- Service endpoints *
- Azure Content Delivery Network *

Features marked with an asterisk (*) don't get swapped, by design.

Note

Certain app settings that apply to unswapped settings are also not swapped. For example, since diagnostic settings aren't swapped, related app settings like `WEBSITE_HTTPLOGGING_RETENTION_DAYS`

and `DIAGNOSTICS_AZUREBLOBRETENTIONDAYS`

are also not swapped, even if they don't show up as slot settings.

### Create a deployment setting

You can mark settings as a deployment setting, which makes it *sticky*. A sticky setting doesn't swap with the app instance.

If you create a deployment setting in one slot, make sure to create the same setting with a unique value in any other slot that is involved in a swap. This way, while a setting's value doesn't change, the setting names remain consistent among slots. This name consistency ensures your code doesn't try to access a setting that is defined in one slot but not another.

Use the following steps to create a deployment setting:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Select

**Configuration**, and then select the setting name you want to stick with the current slot.Select

**Deployment slot setting**, and then select**OK**.Once setting section disappears, select

**Save**to keep the changes

## Deployment

Slots are empty when you create a slot. You can use any of the [supported deployment technologies](functions-deployment-technologies) to deploy your application to a slot.

## Scaling

All slots scale to the same number of workers as the production slot.

- For Consumption plans, the slot scales as the function app scales.
- For App Service plans, the app scales to a fixed number of workers. Slots run on the same number of workers as the app plan.

## View slots

You can view information about existing slots using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to create a new slot in the portal:

Navigate to your function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**and the existing slots are shown.

## Add a slot

You can add a slot using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to create a slot in the portal:

Navigate to your function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**, and then select**+ Add Slot**.Type the name of the slot and select

**Add**.

You can also create a slot by using ARM templates or Bicep files. For an example of how to create a function app in a Consumption plan with a deployment slot, see this [Azure Resource Manager quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-create-dynamic-slot).

## Access slot resources

You access resources (HTTP triggers and administrator endpoints) in a staging slot in the same way as the production slot. However, instead of the function app host name you use the slot-specific host name in the request URL, along with any slot-specific keys. Because staging slots are live apps, you must [secure your functions](security-concepts) in a staging slot as you would in the production slot.

## Swap slots

You can swap slots in an out of production using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to swap a staging slot into production:

Navigate to the function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**, and then select**Swap**.Verify the configuration settings for your swap and select

**Swap**.

The swap operation can take a few seconds.

## Roll back a swap

If a swap results in an error or you simply want to "undo" a swap, you can roll back to the initial state. To return to the preswapped state, do another swap to reverse the swap.

## Remove a slot

You can remove a slot using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to remove a slot from your app in the portal:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Select

**Delete**.Type the name of the deployment slot you want to delete, and then select

**Delete**.Close the confirmation pane.


## Change App Service plan

With a function app that is running under an App Service plan, you can change the underlying App Service plan for a slot.

Note

You can't change a slot's App Service plan under the Consumption plan.

Use the following steps to change a slot's App Service plan:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Under

**App Service plan**, select**Change App Service plan**.Select the plan you want to upgrade to, or create a new plan.

Select

**OK**.

## Considerations

Azure Functions deployment slots have the following considerations:

- The number of slots available to an app depends on the plan. The Consumption plan is only allowed one deployment slot. More slots are available for apps running under other plans. For details, see
[Service limits](functions-scale#service-limits). - Swapping a slot resets keys for apps that have an
`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType`

app setting equal to`files`

. - When slots are enabled, your function app is set to read-only mode in the portal.
- Slot swaps might fail when your function app is using a
[secured storage account](configure-networking-how-to)as its default storage account (set in`AzureWebJobsStorage`

). For more information, see thereference.`WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_DIAGNOSTICS_SETTINGS`

- Use function app names shorter than 32 characters. Names longer than 32 characters are at risk of causing
[host ID collisions](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations).

# Improve throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When developing for Azure Functions using Python, you need to understand how your functions perform and how that performance affects the way your function app gets scaled. The need is more important when designing highly performant apps. The main factors to consider when designing, writing, and configuring your functions apps are horizontal scaling and throughput performance configurations.

## Horizontal scaling

By default, Azure Functions automatically monitors the load on your application and creates more host instances for Python as needed. Azure Functions uses built-in thresholds for different trigger types to decide when to add instances, such as the age of messages and queue size for QueueTrigger. These thresholds aren't user configurable. For more information, see [Event-driven scaling in Azure Functions](event-driven-scaling).

## Improving throughput performance

The default configurations are suitable for most of Azure Functions applications. However, you can improve the performance of your applications' throughput by employing configurations based on your workload profile. The first step is to understand the type of workload that you're running.

| Workload type | Function app characteristics | Examples |
|---|---|---|
I/O-bound |
• App needs to handle many concurrent invocations. • App processes a large number of I/O events, such as network calls and disk read/writes. |
• Web APIs |
CPU-bound |
• App does long-running computations, such as image resizing. • App does data transformation. |
• Data processing • Machine learning inference |

As real world function workloads are usually a mix of I/O and CPU bound, you should profile the app under realistic production loads.

### Performance-specific configurations

After you understand the workload profile of your function app, the following are configurations that you can use to improve the throughput performance of your functions.

[Async](#async)[Multiple language worker](#use-multiple-language-worker-processes)[Max workers within a language worker process](#set-up-max-workers-within-a-language-worker-process)[Event loop](#managing-event-loop)[Vertical Scaling](#vertical-scaling)

#### Async

Because [Python is a single-threaded runtime](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), a host instance for Python can process only one function invocation at a time by default. For applications that process a large number of I/O events and/or is I/O bound, you can improve performance significantly by running functions asynchronously.

To run a function asynchronously, use the `async def`

statement, which runs the function with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) directly:

```
async def main():
await some_nonblocking_socket_io_op()
```


Here's an example of a function with HTTP trigger that uses [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) http client:

```
import aiohttp
import azure.functions as func
async def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as client:
async with client.get("PUT_YOUR_URL_HERE") as response:
return func.HttpResponse(await response.text())
return func.HttpResponse(body='NotFound', status_code=404)
```


A function without the `async`

keyword is run automatically in a ThreadPoolExecutor thread pool:

```
# Runs in a ThreadPoolExecutor threadpool. Number of threads is defined by PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT.
# The example is intended to show how default synchronous functions are handled.
def main():
some_blocking_socket_io()
```


In order to achieve the full benefit of running functions asynchronously, the I/O operation/library that is used in your code needs to have async implemented as well. Using synchronous I/O operations in functions that are defined as asynchronous **may hurt** the overall performance. If the libraries you're using don't have async version implemented, you may still benefit from running your code asynchronously by [managing event loop](#managing-event-loop) in your app.

Here are a few examples of client libraries that have implemented async patterns:

[aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)- Http client/server for asyncio[Streams API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html)- High-level async/await-ready primitives to work with network connection[Janus Queue](https://pypi.org/project/janus/)- Thread-safe asyncio-aware queue for Python[pyzmq](https://pypi.org/project/pyzmq/)- Python bindings for ZeroMQ

##### Understanding async in Python worker

When you define `async`

in front of a function signature, Python marks the function as a coroutine. When you call the coroutine, it can be scheduled as a task into an event loop. When you call `await`

in an async function, it registers a continuation into the event loop, which allows the event loop to process the next task during the wait time.

In our Python Worker, the worker shares the event loop with the customer's `async`

function and it's capable for handling multiple requests concurrently. We strongly encourage our customers to make use of asyncio compatible libraries, such as [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) and [pyzmq](https://pypi.org/project/pyzmq/). Following these recommendations increases your function's throughput compared to those libraries when implemented synchronously.

Note

If your function is declared as `async`

without any `await`

inside its implementation, the performance of your function will be severely impacted since the event loop will be blocked which prohibits the Python worker from handling concurrent requests.

#### Use multiple language worker processes

By default, every Functions host instance has a single language worker process. You can increase the number of worker processes per host (up to 10) by using the [ FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT](functions-app-settings#functions_worker_process_count) application setting. Azure Functions then tries to evenly distribute simultaneous function invocations across these workers.

For CPU bound apps, you should set the number of language workers to be the same as or higher than the number of cores that are available per function app. To learn more, see [Available instance SKUs](functions-premium-plan#available-instance-skus).

I/O-bound apps may also benefit from increasing the number of worker processes beyond the number of cores available. Keep in mind that setting the number of workers too high can affect overall performance due to the increased number of required context switches.

The `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT`

applies to each host that Azure Functions creates when scaling out your application to meet demand.

#### Set up max workers within a language worker process

As mentioned in the async [section](#understanding-async-in-python-worker), the Python language worker treats functions and [coroutines](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines) differently. A coroutine is run within the same event loop that the language worker runs on. On the other hand, a function invocation is run within a [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor), which is maintained by the language worker as a thread.

You can set the value of maximum workers allowed for running sync functions using the [PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT](functions-app-settings#python_threadpool_thread_count) application setting. This value sets the `max_worker`

argument of the ThreadPoolExecutor object, which lets Python use a pool of at most `max_worker`

threads to execute calls asynchronously. The `PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT`

applies to each worker that Functions host creates, and Python decides when to create a new thread or reuse the existing idle thread. For older Python versions(that is, `3.8`

, `3.7`

, and `3.6`

), `max_worker`

value is set to 1. For Python version `3.9`

, `max_worker`

is set to `None`

.

For CPU-bound apps, you should keep the setting to a low number, starting from 1 and increasing as you experiment with your workload. This suggestion is to reduce the time spent on context switches and allowing CPU-bound tasks to finish.

For I/O-bound apps, you should see substantial gains by increasing the number of threads working on each invocation. The recommendation is to start with the Python default (the number of cores) + 4 and then tweak based on the throughput values you're seeing.

For mixed workloads apps, you should balance both `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT`

and `PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT`

configurations to maximize the throughput. To understand what your function apps spend the most time on, we recommend profiling them and setting the values according to their behaviors. To learn about these application settings, see [Use multiple worker processes](#use-multiple-language-worker-processes).

Note

Although these recommendations apply to both HTTP and non-HTTP triggered functions, you might need to adjust other trigger specific configurations for non-HTTP triggered functions to get the expected performance from your function apps. For more information about this, please refer to this [Best practices for reliable Azure Functions](functions-best-practices).

#### Managing event loop

You should use asyncio compatible third-party libraries. If none of the third-party libraries meet your needs, you can also manage the event loops in Azure Functions. Managing event loops give you more flexibility in compute resource management, and it also makes it possible to wrap synchronous I/O libraries into coroutines.

There are many useful Python official documents discussing the [Coroutines and Tasks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) and [Event Loop](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/asyncio-eventloop.html) by using the built-in **asyncio** library.

Take the following [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) library as an example, this code snippet uses the **asyncio** library to wrap the `requests.get()`

method into a coroutine, running multiple web requests to SAMPLE_URL concurrently.

```
import asyncio
import json
import logging
import azure.functions as func
from time import time
from requests import get, Response
async def invoke_get_request(eventloop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop) -> Response:
# Wrap requests.get function into a coroutine
single_result = await eventloop.run_in_executor(
None, # using the default executor
get, # each task call invoke_get_request
'SAMPLE_URL' # the url to be passed into the requests.get function
)
return single_result
async def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
eventloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
# Create 10 tasks for requests.get synchronous call
tasks = [
asyncio.create_task(
invoke_get_request(eventloop)
) for _ in range(10)
]
done_tasks, _ = await asyncio.wait(tasks)
status_codes = [d.result().status_code for d in done_tasks]
return func.HttpResponse(body=json.dumps(status_codes),
mimetype='application/json')
```


#### Vertical scaling

You might be able to get more processing units, especially in CPU-bound operation, by upgrading to premium plan with higher specifications. With higher processing units, you can adjust the number of worker processes count according to the number of cores available and achieve higher degree of parallelism.

# Analyze Azure Functions telemetry in Application Insights

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with Application Insights to better enable you to monitor your function apps. Application Insights collects telemetry data generated by your function app, including information your app writes to logs. Application Insights integration is typically enabled when your function app is created. If your function app doesn't have the instrumentation key set, you must first [enable Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration).

By default, the data collected from your function app is stored in Application Insights. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Application Insights provides an extensive set of visualizations of your telemetry data. You can drill into error logs and query events and metrics. This article provides basic examples of how to view and query your collected data. To learn more about exploring your function app data in Application Insights, see [What is Application Insights?](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

To be able to view Application Insights data from a function app, you must have at least Contributor role permissions on the function app. You also need to have the [Monitoring Reader permission](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/roles-permissions-security#monitoring-reader) on the Application Insights instance. You have these permissions by default for any function app and Application Insights instance that you create.

To learn more about data retention and potential storage costs, see [Data collection, retention, and storage in Application Insights](/en-us/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy).

## Viewing telemetry in Monitor tab

With [Application Insights integration enabled](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration), you can view telemetry data in the **Monitor** tab.

In the function app page, select a function that has run at least once after Application Insights was configured. Then, select

**Monitor**from the left pane. Select**Refresh**periodically, until the list of function invocations appears.Note

It can take up to five minutes for the list to appear while the telemetry client batches data for transmission to the server. The delay doesn't apply to the

[Live Metrics Stream](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream). That service connects to the Functions host when you load the page, so logs are streamed directly to the page.To see the logs for a particular function invocation, select the

**Date (UTC)**column link for that invocation. The logging output for that invocation appears in a new page.Choose

**Run in Application Insights**to view the source of the query that retrieves the Azure Monitor log data in Azure Log. If this is your first time using Azure Log Analytics in your subscription, you're asked to enable it.After you enable Log Analytics, the following query is displayed. You can see that the query results are limited to the last 30 days (

`where timestamp > ago(30d)`

), and the results show no more than 20 rows (`take 20`

). In contrast, the invocation details list for your function is for the last 30 days with no limit.

For more information, see [Query telemetry data](#query-telemetry-data) later in this article.

## View telemetry in Application Insights

To open Application Insights from a function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

Browse to your function app in the portal.

Select

**Application Insights**under**Settings**in the left page.If this is your first time using Application Insights with your subscription, you'll be prompted to enable it. To do this, select

**Turn on Application Insights**, and then select**Apply**on the next page.

For information about how to use Application Insights, see the [Application Insights documentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview). This section shows some examples of how to view data in Application Insights. If you're already familiar with Application Insights, you can go directly to [the sections about how to configure and customize the telemetry data](configure-monitoring#configure-log-levels).

The following areas of Application Insights can be helpful when evaluating the behavior, performance, and errors in your functions:

| Investigate | Description |
|---|---|
|
Create charts and alerts based on function failures and server exceptions. The Operation Name is the function name. Failures in dependencies aren't shown unless you implement custom telemetry for dependencies. |
|
Analyze performance issues by viewing resource utilization and throughput per Cloud role instances. This performance data can be useful for debugging scenarios where functions are bogging down your underlying resources. |
|
Create charts and alerts that are based on metrics. Metrics include the number of function invocations, execution time, and success rates. |
|
View metrics data as it's created in near real time. |

## Query telemetry data

[Application Insights Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) gives you access to all telemetry data in the form of tables in a database. Analytics provides a query language for extracting, manipulating, and visualizing the data.

Choose **Logs** to explore or query for logged events.

Here's a query example that shows the distribution of requests per worker over the last 30 minutes.

```
requests
| where timestamp > ago(30m)
| summarize count() by cloud_RoleInstance, bin(timestamp, 1m)
| render timechart
```


The tables that are available are shown in the **Schema** tab on the left. You can find data generated by function invocations in the following tables:

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
traces |
Logs created by the runtime, scale controller, and traces from your function code. For Flex Consumption plan hosting, `traces` also includes logs created during code deployment. |
requests |
One request for each function invocation. |
exceptions |
Any exceptions thrown by the runtime. |
customMetrics |
The count of successful and failing invocations, success rate, and duration. |
customEvents |
Events tracked by the runtime, for example: HTTP requests that trigger a function. |
performanceCounters |
Information about the performance of the servers that the functions are running on. |

The other tables are for availability tests, and client and browser telemetry. You can implement custom telemetry to add data to them.

Within each table, some of the Functions-specific data is in a `customDimensions`

field. For example, the following query retrieves all traces that have log level `Error`

.

```
traces
| where customDimensions.LogLevel == "Error"
```


The runtime provides the `customDimensions.LogLevel`

and `customDimensions.Category`

fields. You can provide additional fields in logs that you write in your function code. For an example in C#, see [Structured logging](functions-dotnet-class-library#structured-logging) in the .NET class library developer guide.

## Query function invocations

Every function invocation is assigned a unique ID. `InvocationId`

is included in the custom dimension and can be used to correlate all the logs from a particular function execution.

```
traces
| project customDimensions["InvocationId"], message
```


## Telemetry correlation

Logs from different functions can be correlated using `operation_Id`

. Use the following query to return all the logs for a specific logical operation.

```
traces
| where operation_Id == '45fa5c4f8097239efe14a2388f8b4e29'
| project timestamp, customDimensions["InvocationId"], message
| order by timestamp
```


## Sampling percentage

Sampling configuration can be used to reduce the volume of telemetry. Use the following query to determine if sampling is operational or not. If you see that `RetainedPercentage`

for any type is less than 100, then that type of telemetry is being sampled.

```
union requests,dependencies,pageViews,browserTimings,exceptions,traces
| where timestamp > ago(1d)
| summarize RetainedPercentage = 100/avg(itemCount) by bin(timestamp, 1h), itemType
```


## Query scale controller logs

*This feature is in preview.*

After enabling both [scale controller logging](configure-monitoring#configure-scale-controller-logs) and [Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration), you can use the Application Insights log search to query for the emitted scale controller logs. Scale controller logs are saved in the `traces`

collection under the **ScaleControllerLogs** category.

The following query can be used to search for all scale controller logs for the current function app within the specified time period:

```
traces
| extend CustomDimensions = todynamic(tostring(customDimensions))
| where CustomDimensions.Category == "ScaleControllerLogs"
```


The following query expands on the previous query to show how to get only logs indicating a change in scale:

```
traces
| extend CustomDimensions = todynamic(tostring(customDimensions))
| where CustomDimensions.Category == "ScaleControllerLogs"
| where message == "Instance count changed"
| extend Reason = CustomDimensions.Reason
| extend PreviousInstanceCount = CustomDimensions.PreviousInstanceCount
| extend NewInstanceCount = CustomDimensions.CurrentInstanceCount
```


## Query Flex Consumption code deployment logs

The following query can be used to search for all code deployment logs for the current function app within the specified time period:

```
traces
| extend deploymentId = customDimensions.deploymentId
| where deploymentId != ''
| project timestamp, deploymentId, message, severityLevel, customDimensions, appName
```


## Consumption plan-specific metrics

When running in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan), the execution *cost* of a single function execution is measured in *GB-seconds*. Execution cost is calculated by combining its memory usage with its execution time. To learn more, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

The following telemetry queries are specific to metrics that impact the cost of running functions in the Consumption plan.

#### Determine memory usage

Under **Monitoring**, select **Logs (Analytics)**, then copy the following telemetry query and paste it into the query window and select **Run**. This query returns the total memory usage at each sampled time.

```
performanceCounters
| where name == "Private Bytes"
| project timestamp, name, value
```


The results look like the following example:

| timestamp [UTC] | name | value |
|---|---|---|
| 9/12/2019, 1:05:14.947 AM | Private Bytes | 209,932,288 |
| 9/12/2019, 1:06:14.994 AM | Private Bytes | 212,189,184 |
| 9/12/2019, 1:06:30.010 AM | Private Bytes | 231,714,816 |
| 9/12/2019, 1:07:15.040 AM | Private Bytes | 210,591,744 |
| 9/12/2019, 1:12:16.285 AM | Private Bytes | 216,285,184 |
| 9/12/2019, 1:12:31.376 AM | Private Bytes | 235,806,720 |

#### Determine duration

Azure Monitor tracks metrics at the resource level, which for Functions is the function app. Application Insights integration emits metrics on a per-function basis. Here's an example analytics query to get the average duration of a function:

```
customMetrics
| where name contains "Duration"
| extend averageDuration = valueSum / valueCount
| summarize averageDurationMilliseconds=avg(averageDuration) by name
```


| name | averageDurationMilliseconds |
|---|---|
| QueueTrigger AvgDurationMs | 16.087 |
| QueueTrigger MaxDurationMs | 90.249 |
| QueueTrigger MinDurationMs | 8.522 |

# Event-driven scaling in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In the Consumption, Flex Consumption, and Premium plans, Azure Functions scales resources by adding more instances based on the number of events that trigger a function.

The way in which your function app scales depends on the hosting plan:

**Consumption plan:**Each instance of the Functions host in the Consumption plan is limited, typically to 1.5 GB of memory and one CPU. An instance of the host supports the entire function app. As such, all functions within a function app that share resources in an instance are scaled at the same time. When function apps share the same Consumption plan, they're still scaled independently.**Flex Consumption plan:**The plan uses a deterministic per-function scaling strategy. Each function is scaled independently, except for HTTP, Blob, and Durable Functions triggered functions which scale in their own groups. For more information, see[Per-function scaling](#per-function-scaling). These instances are then scaled based on the concurrency of your requests.**Premium plan:**The specific size of the Premium plan determines the available memory and CPU for all apps in that plan on that instance. The plan scales out its instances based on the scaling needs of the apps in the plan, and the apps scale within the plan as needed.

Function code files are stored on Azure Files shares on the function's main storage account. When you delete the main storage account of the function app, the function code files are deleted and can't be recovered.

## Runtime scaling

Azure Functions uses a component called the *scale controller* to monitor the rate of events and determine whether to scale out or scale in. The scale controller uses heuristics for each trigger type. For example, when you're using an Azure Queue storage trigger, it uses [target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling).

The unit of scale for Azure Functions is the function app. When the function app is scaled out, more resources are allocated to run multiple instances of the Azure Functions host. Conversely, as compute demand is reduced, the scale controller removes function host instances. The number of instances is eventually "scaled in" when no functions are running within a function app.


## Cold Start

Should your function app become idle for a few minutes, the platform might decide to scale the number of instances on which your app runs down to zero. The next request has the added latency of scaling from zero to one. This latency is referred to as a *cold start*. The number of dependencies required by your function app can affect the cold start time. Cold start is more of an issue for synchronous operations, such as HTTP triggers that must return a response. If cold starts are impacting your functions, consider using a plan other than the Consumption. The other plans offer these strategies to mitigate or eliminate cold starts:

[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan#eliminate-cold-starts): supports both prewarmed instances and always ready instances, with a minimum of one instance.[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan#always-ready-instances): supports an optional number of always ready instances, which can be defined on a per instance scaling basis.[Dedicated plan](dedicated-plan#always-on): the plan itself doesn't scale dynamically, but you can run your app continuously when the**Always on**setting is enabled.

## Understanding scaling behaviors

Scaling can vary based on several factors, and apps scale differently based on the triggers and language selected. There are a few intricacies of scaling behaviors to be aware of:

**Maximum instances:**A single function app only scales out to a[maximum allowed by the plan](functions-scale#scale). However, a single instance[can process more than one message or request at a time](functions-concurrency#concurrency-in-azure-functions). You can[specify a lower maximum](#limit-scale-out)to throttle scale as required.**New instance rate:**For HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once per second. For non-HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once every 30 seconds. Scaling is faster when running in a[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan).**Target-based scaling:**Target-based scaling provides a fast and intuitive scaling model for customers. Currently, this scaling method is supported for Service Bus queues and topics, Storage queues, Event Hubs, Apache Kafka, and Azure Cosmos DB extensions. Make sure to review[target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling)to understand their scaling behavior.**Per-function scaling:**With some notable exceptions, functions running in the Flex Consumption plan scale on independent instances. The exceptions include HTTP triggers and Blob storage (Event Grid) triggers. Each of these trigger types scale together as a group on the same instances. Likewise, the triggers of all Durable Functions also share instances and scale together. For more information, see[per-function scaling](#per-function-scaling).**Maximum monitored triggers:**Currently, the scale controller can only monitor up to 100 triggers to making scaling decisions. When your app has more than 100 event-based triggers, scale decisions are made based on only the first 100 triggers that execute. For more information, see[Best practices and patterns for scalable apps](#best-practices-and-patterns-for-scalable-apps).

## Limit scale-out

You might decide to restrict the maximum number of instances an app can use for scale-out. This limitation is most common for cases where a downstream component like a database has limited throughput. For the maximum scale limits when running the various hosting plans, see [Scale limits](functions-scale#scale).

### Flex Consumption plan

By default, apps running in a Flex Consumption plan have limit of `100`

overall instances. Currently the lowest maximum instance count value is `40`

, and the highest supported maximum instance count value is `1000`

. When you use the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan, use the

`--maximum-instance-count`

parameter to set this maximum instance count for of your app.While you can change the maximum instance count of Flex Consumption apps up to 1000, the quota limit for your apps is reached before reaching that number. Review [Regional subscription memory quotas](flex-consumption-plan#regional-subscription-memory-quotas) for more details.

This example creates an app with a maximum instance count of `200`

:

```
az functionapp create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --storage <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> --runtime <LANGUAGE_RUNTIME> --runtime-version <RUNTIME_VERSION> --flexconsumption-location <REGION> --maximum-instance-count 200
```


This example uses the [ az functionapp scale config set](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/scale/config#az-functionapp-scale-config-set) command to change the maximum instance count for an existing app to

`150`

:```
az functionapp scale config set --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <APP_NAME> --maximum-instance-count 150
```


### Consumption/Premium plans

In a Consumption or Elastic Premium plan, you can specify a lower maximum limit for your app by modifying the value of the `functionAppScaleLimit`

site configuration setting. The `functionAppScaleLimit`

can be set to `0`

or `null`

for unrestricted, or a valid value between `1`

and the app maximum.

```
az resource update --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> -n <FUNCTION_APP-NAME>/config/web --set properties.functionAppScaleLimit=<SCALE_LIMIT>
```


## Scale-in behaviors

Event-driven scaling automatically reduces capacity when demand for your functions is reduced. It makes this reduction by draining instances of their current function executions and then removes those instances. This behavior is logged as drain mode. The grace period for functions that are currently executing can extend up to 10 minutes for Consumption plan apps and up to 60 minutes for Flex Consumption and Premium plan apps. Event-driven scaling and this behavior don't apply to Dedicated plan apps.

The following considerations apply for scale-in behaviors:

- For apps running on Windows in a Consumption plan, only apps created after May 2021 have drain mode behaviors enabled by default.
- To enable graceful shutdown for functions using the Service Bus trigger, use version 4.2.0 or a later version of the
[Service Bus Extension](functions-bindings-service-bus).

## Per-function scaling

*Applies only to the Flex Consumption plan*.

The [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) is unique in that it implements a *per-function scaling* behavior. In per-function scaling, except for HTTP triggers, Blob (Event Grid) triggers, and Durable Functions, all other function trigger types in your app scale on independent instances. HTTP triggers in your app all scale together as a group on the same instances, as do all Blob (Event Grid), and all Durable Functions triggers, which have their own shared instances.

Consider a function app hosted by a Flex Consumption plan that has the following functions:

| function1 | function2 | function3 | function4 | function5 | function6 | function7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP trigger | HTTP trigger | Orchestration trigger (Durable) | Activity trigger (Durable) | Service Bus trigger | Service Bus trigger | Event Hubs trigger |

In this example:

- The two HTTP triggered functions (
`function1`

and`function2`

) both run together on their own instances and scale together according to[HTTP concurrency settings](flex-consumption-how-to#set-http-concurrency-limits). - The two Durable functions (
`function3`

and`function4`

) both run together on their own instances and scale together based on[configured concurrency throttles](durable/durable-functions-perf-and-scale#concurrency-throttles). - The Service bus triggered function
`function5`

runs in its own and is scaled independently according to the[target-based scaling rules for Service Bus queues and topics](functions-target-based-scaling#service-bus-queues-and-topics). - The Service bus triggered function
`function6`

runs in its own and is scaled independently according to the[target-based scaling rules for Service Bus queues and topics](functions-target-based-scaling#service-bus-queues-and-topics). - The Event Hubs trigger (
`function7`

) runs in its own instances and is scaled independently according to the[target-based scaling rules for Event Hubs](functions-target-based-scaling#event-hubs).

## Best practices and patterns for scalable apps

There are many aspects of a function app that impacts how it scales, including host configuration, runtime footprint, and resource efficiency. For more information, see the [scalability section of the performance considerations article](performance-reliability#scalability-best-practices). You should also be aware of how connections behave as your function app scales. For more information, see [How to manage connections in Azure Functions](manage-connections).

If your app has more than 100 functions that use event-based triggers, consider breaking the app into one or more apps, where each app has less than 100 event-based functions.

For more information on scaling in Python and Node.js, see the **Scaling and performance** section of the [Azure Functions Python developer guide](functions-reference-python) and the **Scaling and concurrency** section of the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node).

# Dapr State input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr state input binding allows you to read Dapr state during a function execution.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("StateInputBinding")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = "state/{key}")] HttpRequest req,
[DaprState("statestore", Key = "{key}")] string state,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult(state);
}
```


The following example creates a `"RetrieveOrder"`

function using the `DaprStateInput`

binding with the [ DaprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke):

```
@FunctionName("RetrieveOrder")
public String run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "RetrieveOrder")
String payload,
@DaprStateInput(
stateStore = "%StateStoreName%",
key = "order")
String product,
final ExecutionContext context)
```


In the following example, the Dapr invoke input binding is added as an `extraInput`

and paired with an HTTP trigger, which is registered by the `app`

object:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('StateInputBinding', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'httpTrigger',
authLevel: 'anonymous',
methods: ['GET'],
route: "state/{key}",
name: "req"
}),
extraInputs: [daprStateInput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
const daprStateInputValue = context.extraInputs.get(daprStateInput);
// print the fetched state value
context.log(daprStateInputValue);
return daprStateInputValue;
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprState`

:

```
{
"bindings":
{
"type": "daprState",
"direction": "in",
"key": "order",
"stateStore": "%StateStoreName%",
"name": "order"
}
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload, $order
)
# C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $order | ConvertTo-Json
Write-Host "$jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr State input binding, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprState`

binding alongside the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_state_input(arg_name="data", state_store="statestore", key="order")
def main(payload, data: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveOrder --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.')
logging.info(data)
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprState`

to read Dapr state into your function, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
StateStore |
The name of the state store to retrieve state. |
Key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |

## Annotations

The `DaprStateInput`

annotation allows you to read Dapr state into your function.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
stateStore |
The name of the Dapr state store. |
key |
The state store key value. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
stateStore |
The name of the state store. |
key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |
stateStore |
The name of the state store. |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

To use the Dapr state input binding, start by setting up a Dapr state store component. You can learn more about which component to use and how to set it up in the official Dapr documentation.

To use the `daprState`

in Python v2, set up your project with the correct dependencies.

In your

`requirements.text`

file, add the following line:`azure-functions==1.18.0b3`

In the terminal, install the Python library.

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Modify your

`local.setting.json`

file with the following configuration:`"PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES":1`

# Azure Functions proxies (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions is an essential compute service that you use to build serverless REST-based APIs. HTTP triggers expose REST endpoints that can be called by your clients, like browsers, mobile apps, and other backend services. With [native support for routes](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#customize-the-http-endpoint), a single HTTP triggered function can expose a highly functional REST API. Functions also provides its own basic key-based authorization scheme to help limit access only to specific clients. For more information, see [Azure Functions HTTP trigger](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger)

In some scenarios, you may need your API to support a more complex set of REST behaviors. For example, you may need to combine multiple HTTP function endpoints into a single API. You might also want to pass requests through to one or more backend REST-based services. Finally, your APIs might require a higher-degree of security that lets you monetize its use.

To build more complex and robust APIs based on your functions, you should instead use the comprehensive API services provided by [Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-key-concepts).
API Management uses a policy-based model to let you control routing, security, and OpenAPI integration. It also supports advanced policies like rate limiting monetization.

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

## Moving from Functions Proxies to API Management

When moving from Functions Proxies to using API Management, you must integrate your function app with an API Management instance, and then configure the API Management instance to behave like the previous proxy. The following section provides links to the relevant articles that help you succeed in using API Management with Azure Functions.

If you have challenges moving from proxies or if Azure API Management doesn't address your specific scenarios, post a request in the [API Management feedback forum](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/e808a70c-ff24-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0858).

## API Management integration

API Management lets you import an existing function app. After import, each HTTP triggered function endpoint becomes an API that you can modify and manage. After import, you can also use API Management to generate an OpenAPI definition file for your APIs. During import, any endpoints with an `admin`

[authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth) are ignored. For more information about using API Management with Functions, see the following articles:

| Article | Description |

[Create serverless APIs in Visual Studio using Azure Functions and API Management integration](openapi-apim-integrate-visual-studio)[OpenAPI extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-openapi-extension). The OpenAPI extension lets you define your .NET APIs by applying attributes directly to your C# code.[Quickstart: Create a new Azure API Management service instance by using the Azure portal](../api-management/get-started-create-service-instance)[Import an Azure function app as an API in Azure API Management](../api-management/import-function-app-as-api)After you have your function app endpoints exposed by using API Management, the following articles provide general information about how to manage your Functions-based APIs in the API Management instance.

The legacy [Functions Proxies feature](legacy-proxies) also provides a set of basic API functionality for version 3.x and older version of the Functions runtime.

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

Some basic hints for how to perform equivalent tasks using API Management have been added to the [Functions Proxies article](legacy-proxies). We don't currently have documentation or tools to help you migrate an existing Functions Proxies implementation to API Management.

# Create your first containerized functions on Azure Container Apps

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you create a function app running in a Linux container and deploy it to an Azure Container Apps environment from a container registry. By deploying to Container Apps, you're able to integrate your function apps into cloud-native microservices. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

Important

A new hosting method for running Azure Functions directly in Azure Container Apps is now available. See [Native Azure Functions Support in Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039). This integration allows you to use the full features and capabilities of Azure Container Apps. You also benefit from the functions programming model and simplicity of autoscaling provided by Azure Functions.

We recommend this approach for most new workloads. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview).

This article shows you how to create functions running in a Linux container and deploy the container to a Container Apps environment.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account, which you can minimize by [cleaning-up resources](#clean-up-resources) when you're done.

## Choose your development language

First, you use Azure Functions tools to create your project code as a function app in a Docker container using a language-specific Linux base image. Make sure to select your language of choice at the top of the article.

Core Tools automatically generates a Dockerfile for your project that uses the most up-to-date version of the correct base image for your functions language. You should regularly update your container from the latest base image and redeploy from the updated version of your container. For more information, see [Creating containerized function apps](functions-how-to-custom-container#creating-containerized-function-apps).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following requirements in place:

Install the

[.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).Install

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.0.5198, or a later version.

- Install
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.

- Install a version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-node#supported-versions).

- Install a version of Python that is
[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions).

- Install the
[.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Install a version of the

[Java Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-java#supported-versions).Install

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org)version 3.0 or above.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version 2.4 or a later version.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

To publish the containerized function app image you create to a container registry, you need a Docker ID and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) running on your local computer. If you don't have a Docker ID, you can [create a Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

You also need to complete the [Create a container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal#create-a-container-registry) section of the Container Registry quickstart to create a registry instance. Make a note of your fully qualified login server name.

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Make sure to use one of the [Python versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions) supported by Azure Functions.

```
python -m venv .venv
```


```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment.

## Create and test the local functions project

In a terminal or command prompt, run the following command for your chosen language to create a function app project in the current folder:

```
func init --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime powershell --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime python --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript --docker
```


In an empty folder, run the following command to generate the Functions project from a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=8 -Ddocker
```


The `-DjavaVersion`

parameter tells the Functions runtime which version of Java to use. Use `-DjavaVersion=11`

if you want your functions to run on Java 11. When you don't specify `-DjavaVersion`

, Maven defaults to Java 8. For more information, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions).

Important

The `JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the JDK to complete this article.

Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment. Follow the prompts and provide the following information:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
groupId |
`com.fabrikam` |
A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the
|

**artifactId**`fabrikam-functions`

**version**`1.0-SNAPSHOT`

**package**`com.fabrikam.functions`

Type `Y`

or press Enter to confirm.

Maven creates the project files in a new folder named *artifactId*, which in this example is `fabrikam-functions`

.

The `--docker`

option generates a *Dockerfile* for the project, which defines a suitable container for use with Azure Functions and the selected runtime.

Navigate into the project folder:

```
cd fabrikam-functions
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a C# code file in your project.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a configuration file named *function.json*.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


To test the function locally, start the local Azure Functions runtime host in the root of the project folder. To ensure the function can be called later when hosted in Docker, check that the authorization level is set to AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, or set it if not already configured.

```
func start
```


```
func start
```


```
npm install
npm start
```


```
mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```


After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to that endpoint. You should see a welcome message in the response output.

After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser must display a "hello" message that echoes back `Functions`

, the value supplied to the `name`

query parameter.

Press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop the host.

## Build the container image and verify locally

(Optional) Examine the *Dockerfile* in the root of the project folder. The *Dockerfile* describes the required environment to run the function app on Linux. The complete list of supported base images for Azure Functions can be found in the [Azure Functions base image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-base).

In the root project folder, run the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command, provide a name as `azurefunctionsimage`

, and tag as `v1.0.0`

. Replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker Hub account ID. This command builds the Docker image for the container.

```
docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .
```


When the command completes, you can run the new container locally.

To verify the build, run the image in a local container using the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command, replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

again with your Docker Hub account ID, and add the ports argument as `-p 8080:80`

:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -it <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```


After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample`

, which must display the same greeting message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

, which must display the same "hello" message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After verifying the function app in the container, press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop execution.

## Publish the container image to a registry

To make your container image available for deployment to a hosting environment, you must push it to a container registry. As a security best practice, you should use an Azure Container Registry instance and enforce managed identity-based connections. Docker Hub requires you to authenticate using shared secrets, which make your deployments more vulnerable.

Azure Container Registry is a private registry service for building, storing, and managing container images and related artifacts. You should use a private registry service for publishing your containers to Azure services.

Use this command to sign in to your registry instance using your current Azure credentials:

`az acr login --name <REGISTRY_NAME>`

In the previous command, replace

`<REGISTRY_NAME>`

with the name of your Container Registry instance.Use this command to tag your image with the fully qualified name of your registry login server:

`docker tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

Replace

`<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with the fully qualified name of your registry login server and`<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker ID.Use this command to push the container to your registry instance:

`docker push <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`


## Create supporting Azure resources for your function

Before you can deploy your container to Azure, you need to create three resources:

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A
[Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used to maintain state and other information about your functions. - An Azure Container Apps environment with a Log Analytics workspace.
- A user-assigned managed identity, which enables your function app to securely connect to Azure resources without using shared secrets. Connections to both the Azure Storage account and to the Azure Container Registry instance are instead made using Microsoft Entra authentication with the identity, which is recommended for this scenario.

Note

Docker Hub doesn't support managed identities.

Use these commands to create your required Azure resources:

If necessary, sign in to Azure:

The

command signs you into your Azure account. Use`az login`

`az account set`

when you have more than one subscription associated with your account.Run the following command to update the Azure CLI to the latest version:

`az upgrade`

If your version of Azure CLI isn't the latest version, an installation begins. The manner of upgrade depends on your operating system. You can proceed after the upgrade is complete.

Run the following commands that upgrade the Azure Container Apps extension and register namespaces required by Container Apps:

`az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade -y az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Web az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights`

Create a resource group named

`AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`

.`az group create --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus`

This

command creates a resource group in the East US region. If you instead want to use a region near you, using an available region code returned from the`az group create`

[az account list-locations](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-list-locations)command. You must modify subsequent commands to use your custom region instead of`eastus`

.Create Azure Container App environment with workload profiles enabled.

`az containerapp env create --name MyContainerappEnvironment --enable-workload-profiles --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus`

This command can take a few minutes to complete.

Create a general-purpose storage account in your resource group and region, without shared key access.

`az storage account create --name <STORAGE_NAME> --location eastus --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access false --allow-shared-key-access false`

The

command creates the storage account that can only be accessed by using Microsoft Entra-authenticated identities that have been granted permissions to specific resources.`az storage account create`

In the previous example, replace

`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with a name that is appropriate to you and unique in Azure Storage. Storage names must contain 3 to 24 characters numbers and lowercase letters only.`Standard_LRS`

specifies a general-purpose account[supported by Functions](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).Create a managed identity and use the returned

`principalId`

to grant it both access to your storage account and pull permissions in your registry instance.`principalId=$(az identity create --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --location eastus --query principalId -o tsv) acrId=$(az acr show --name <REGISTRY_NAME> --query id --output tsv) az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $principalId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --role acrpull --scope $acrId storageId=$(az storage account show --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <STORAGE_NAME> --query 'id' -o tsv) az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $principalId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --role "Storage Blob Data Owner" --scope $storageId`

The

command creates a user-assigned managed identity and the`az identity create`

commands adds your identity to the required roles. Replace`az role assignment create`

`<REGISTRY_NAME>`

,`<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`

, and`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with the name your existing container registry, the name for your managed identity, and the storage account name, respectively. The managed identity can now be used by an app to access both the storage account and Azure Container Registry without using shared secrets.

## Create and configure a function app on Azure with the image

A function app on Azure manages the execution of your functions in your Azure Container Apps environment. In this section, you use the Azure resources from the previous section to create a function app from an image in a container registry in a Container Apps environment. You also configure the new environment with a connection string to the required Azure Storage account.

Use the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app in the new managed environment backed by Azure Container Apps. In

[, the](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create)

`az functionapp create`

`--environment`

parameter specifies the Container Apps environment.Tip

To make sure that your function app uses a managed identity-based connection to your registry instance, don't set the `--image`

parameter in `az functionapp create`

. When you set `--image`

to the fully qualified name of your image in the repository, shared secret credentials are obtained from your registry and stored in app settings.

First you must get the fully qualified ID value of your user-assigned managed identity with pull access to the registry, and then use the [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) command to create a function app using the default image and with this identity assigned to it.

```
UAMI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $uami_name --resource-group $group --query id -o tsv)
az functionapp create --name <APP_NAME> --storage-account <STORAGE_NAME> --environment MyContainerappEnvironment --workload-profile-name "Consumption" --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --functions-version 4 --assign-identity $UAMI_RESOURCE_ID
```


In [ az functionapp create](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create), the

`--assign-identity`

assigns your managed identity to the new app. Because you didn't set the `--image`

parameter in `az functionapp create`

, the application is created using a placeholder image.In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`

, `<STORAGE_NAME>`

, and `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`

with a name for your new function app as well as the name of your storage account and the identity.

Finally, you must update the [ linuxFxVersion](functions-app-settings#linuxfxversion) site setting to the fully qualified name of your image in the repository. You must also update the

[and](functions-app-settings#acrusemanagedidentitycreds)

`acrUseManagedIdentityCreds`

[site settings so that managed identities are used when obtaining the image from the registry.](functions-app-settings#acrusermanagedidentityid)

`acrUserManagedIdentityID`

```
UAMI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --query id -o tsv)
az resource patch --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <APP_NAME> --resource-type "Microsoft.Web/sites" --properties "{ \"siteConfig\": { \"linuxFxVersion\": \"DOCKER|<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0\", \"acrUseManagedIdentityCreds\": true, \"acrUserManagedIdentityID\":\"$UAMI_RESOURCE_ID\", \"appSettings\": [{\"name\": \"DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL\", \"value\": \"<REGISTRY_NAME>.azurecr.io\"}]}}"
```


In addition to the required site settings, the [ az resource patch](/en-us/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-patch) command also updates the

[app setting to the URL of your registry server.](functions-app-settings#docker_registry_server_url)

`DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL`

In this example, replace `<APP_NAME>`

, `<REGISTRY_NAME>`

, and `<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`

with the names of your function app, container registry, and identity, respectively.

Specifying `--workload-profile-name "Consumption"`

creates your app in an environment using the default `Consumption`

workload profile, which costs the same as running in a Container Apps Consumption plan. When you first create the function app, it pulls the initial image from your registry.

## Update application settings

To enable the Functions host to connect to the default storage account using shared secrets, you must replace the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection string setting with an equivalent setting that uses the user-assigned managed identity to connect to the storage account.

Remove the existing

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection string setting:`az functionapp config appsettings delete --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --setting-names AzureWebJobsStorage`

The

[az functionapp config appsettings delete](/en-us/cli/azure/functionapp/config/appsettings#az-functionapp-config-appsettings-delete)command removes this setting from your app. Replace`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app.Add equivalent settings, with an

`AzureWebJobsStorage__`

prefix, that define a user-assigned managed identity connection to the default storage account:`clientId=$(az identity show --name <USER_IDENTITY_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --query 'clientId' -o tsv) az functionapp config appsettings set --name <APP_NAME> --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --settings AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName=<STORAGE_NAME> AzureWebJobsStorage__credential=managedidentity AzureWebJobsStorage__clientId=$clientId`

In this example, replace

`<APP_NAME>`

,`<USER_IDENTITY_NAME>`

,`<STORAGE_NAME>`

with your function app name, the name of your identity, and the storage account name, respectively.

At this point, your functions are running in a Container Apps environment, with the required application settings already added. When needed, you can add other settings in your functions app in the standard way for Functions. For more information, see [Use application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings).

Tip

When you make subsequent changes to your function code, you need to rebuild the container, republish the image to the registry, and update the function app with the new image version. For more information, see [Update an image in the registry](functions-how-to-custom-container#update-an-image-in-the-registry)

## Verify your functions on Azure

With the image deployed to your function app in Azure, you can now invoke the function through HTTP requests.

Run the following

command to get the URL of your new function:`az functionapp function show`

`az functionapp function show --resource-group AzureFunctionsContainers-rg --name <APP_NAME> --function-name HttpExample --query invokeUrlTemplate`

Replace

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app.

- Use the URL you just obtained to call the
`HttpExample`

function endpoint, appending the query string`?name=Functions`

.

- Use the URL you just obtained to call the
`HttpExample`

function endpoint.

When you navigate to this URL, the browser must display similar output as when you ran the function locally.

The request URL should look something like this:

`https://myacafunctionapp.kindtree-796af82b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/httpexample?name=functions`


`https://myacafunctionapp.kindtree-796af82b.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/httpexample`


## Clean up resources

If you want to continue working with Azure Function using the resources you created in this article, you can leave all those resources in place.

When you're done working with this function app deployment, delete the `AzureFunctionsContainers-rg`

resource group to clean up all the resources in that group:

```
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsContainers-rg
```

## Sample script

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

To open the Cloud Shell, just select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

When Cloud Shell opens, verify that **Bash** is selected for your environment. Subsequent sessions will use Azure CLI in a Bash environment, Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press **Enter** to run it.

### Sign in to Azure

Cloud Shell is automatically authenticated under the initial account signed-in with. Use the following script to sign in using a different subscription, replacing *subscriptionId* with your Azure subscription ID.

If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

```
subscription="subscriptionId" # Set Azure subscription ID here
az account set -s $subscription # ...or use 'az login'
```


For more information, see [set active subscription](/en-us/cli/azure/account#az-account-set) or [log in interactively](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login).

### Run the script

```
# Function app and storage account names must be unique.
# Variable block
let "randomIdentifier=$RANDOM*$RANDOM"
location="eastus"
resourceGroup="msdocs-azure-functions-rg-$randomIdentifier"
tag="create-function-app-connect-to-storage-account"

functionApp="msdocs-serverless-function-$randomIdentifier"
skuStorage="Standard_LRS"
functionsVersion="4"
# Create a resource group
echo "Creating $resourceGroup in "$location"..."
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location "$location" --tags $tag
# Create an Azure storage account in the resource group.
echo "Creating $storage"
az storage account create --name $storage --location "$location" --resource-group $resourceGroup --sku $skuStorage
# Create a serverless function app in the resource group.

az functionapp create --name $functionApp --resource-group $resourceGroup --storage-account $storage --consumption-plan-location "$location" --functions-version $functionsVersion
# Get the storage account connection string.
connstr=$(az storage account show-connection-string --name $storage --resource-group $resourceGroup --query connectionString --output tsv)
# Update function app settings to connect to the storage account.
az functionapp config appsettings set --name $functionApp --resource-group $resourceGroup --settings StorageConStr=$connstr
```


## Clean up resources

Use the following command to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it using the [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command - unless you have an ongoing need for these resources. Some of these resources may take a while to create, as well as to delete.

# Azure Functions proxies (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions is an essential compute service that you use to build serverless REST-based APIs. HTTP triggers expose REST endpoints that can be called by your clients, like browsers, mobile apps, and other backend services. With [native support for routes](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#customize-the-http-endpoint), a single HTTP triggered function can expose a highly functional REST API. Functions also provides its own basic key-based authorization scheme to help limit access only to specific clients. For more information, see [Azure Functions HTTP trigger](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger)

In some scenarios, you may need your API to support a more complex set of REST behaviors. For example, you may need to combine multiple HTTP function endpoints into a single API. You might also want to pass requests through to one or more backend REST-based services. Finally, your APIs might require a higher-degree of security that lets you monetize its use.

To build more complex and robust APIs based on your functions, you should instead use the comprehensive API services provided by [Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-key-concepts).
API Management uses a policy-based model to let you control routing, security, and OpenAPI integration. It also supports advanced policies like rate limiting monetization.

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

## Moving from Functions Proxies to API Management

When moving from Functions Proxies to using API Management, you must integrate your function app with an API Management instance, and then configure the API Management instance to behave like the previous proxy. The following section provides links to the relevant articles that help you succeed in using API Management with Azure Functions.

If you have challenges moving from proxies or if Azure API Management doesn't address your specific scenarios, post a request in the [API Management feedback forum](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/e808a70c-ff24-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0858).

## API Management integration

API Management lets you import an existing function app. After import, each HTTP triggered function endpoint becomes an API that you can modify and manage. After import, you can also use API Management to generate an OpenAPI definition file for your APIs. During import, any endpoints with an `admin`

[authorization level](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#http-auth) are ignored. For more information about using API Management with Functions, see the following articles:

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Create serverless APIs in Visual Studio using Azure Functions and API Management integration](openapi-apim-integrate-visual-studio)[OpenAPI extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-openapi-extension). The OpenAPI extension lets you define your .NET APIs by applying attributes directly to your C# code.[Quickstart: Create a new Azure API Management service instance by using the Azure portal](../api-management/get-started-create-service-instance)[Import an Azure function app as an API in Azure API Management](../api-management/import-function-app-as-api)After you have your function app endpoints exposed by using API Management, the following articles provide general information about how to manage your Functions-based APIs in the API Management instance.

|

[Policies in Azure API Management](../api-management/api-management-howto-policies)[API Management policy reference](../api-management/api-management-policies)[API Management policy samples](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets)## Legacy Functions Proxies

The legacy [Functions Proxies feature](legacy-proxies) also provides a set of basic API functionality for version 3.x and older version of the Functions runtime.

Important

Azure Functions proxies is a legacy feature for [versions 1.x through 3.x](functions-versions) of the Azure Functions runtime. Proxies can be re-enabled temporarily in version 4.x for you to successfully upgrade your function apps to the latest runtime version. As soon as possible, you should switch to integrating your function apps with Azure API Management. API Management lets you take advantage of a more complete set of features for defining, securing, managing, and monetizing your Functions-based APIs. For more information, see [API Management integration](functions-proxies#api-management-integration).

To learn how to temporarily re-enable proxies support in Functions version 4.x, see [Re-enable proxies in Functions v4.x](legacy-proxies#re-enable-proxies-in-functions-v4x).

Some basic hints for how to perform equivalent tasks using API Management have been added to the [Functions Proxies article](legacy-proxies). We don't currently have documentation or tools to help you migrate an existing Functions Proxies implementation to API Management.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

These end-to-end Azure CLI scripts are provided to help you learn how to provision and managing the Azure resources required by Azure Functions. You must use the [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local) to create actual Azure Functions code projects from the command line on your local computer and deploy code to these Azure resources. For a complete end-to-end example of developing and deploying from the command line using both Core Tools and the Azure CLI, see one of these language-specific command line quickstarts:

# Azure Functions Consumption plan hosting

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you're using the Consumption plan, instances of the Azure Functions host are dynamically added and removed based on the number of incoming events.

Important

After 30 September 2028, the option to host your function app on Linux in a Consumption plan is retired. To avoid disruptions, migrate your existing Consumption plan apps that run on Linux to the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) before that date. Apps running on Windows in a Consumption plan aren't affected by this change.
For more information, see the [Linux Consumption plan retirement notice](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2335809).

The Consumption plan scales automatically, even during periods of high load. When running functions in a Consumption plan, you're charged for compute resources only when your functions are running. On a Consumption plan, a function execution times out after a configurable period of time.

Tip

The Flex Consumption plan is now the recommended serverless hosting plan for Azure Functions. It offers faster scaling, reduced cold starts, private networking, and more control over performance and cost. For more information, see [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan).

## Billing

Billing is based on number of executions, execution time, and memory used. Usage is aggregated across all functions within a function app. For more information, see [Azure Functions pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/functions/).

To learn more about how to estimate costs when running in a Consumption plan, see [Understanding Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Create a Consumption plan function app

When you create a function app in the Azure portal, the Consumption plan is the default. When using APIs to create your function app, you don't have to first create an App Service plan as you do with Premium and Dedicated plans.

In Consumption plan hosting, each function app typically runs in its own plan. In the Azure portal or in code, you might also see the Consumption plan referred to as `Dynamic`

or `Y1`

.

Use the following links to learn how to create a serverless function app in a Consumption plan, either programmatically or in the Azure portal:

You can also create function apps in a Consumption plan when you publish a Functions project from [Visual Studio Code](how-to-create-function-vs-code#create-the-function-app-in-azure) or [Visual Studio](functions-create-your-first-function-visual-studio#publish-the-project-to-azure).

## Multiple apps in the same plan

The general recommendation is for each function app to have its own Consumption plan. However, if needed, function apps in the same region can be assigned to the same Consumption plan. Keep in mind that there's a [limit to the number of function apps that can run in a Consumption plan](functions-scale#service-limits). Function apps in the same plan still scale independently of each other.

# Dapr Topic trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can be triggered on a Dapr topic subscription using the following Dapr events.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("TransferEventBetweenTopics")]
public static void Run(
[DaprTopicTrigger("%PubSubName%", Topic = "A")] CloudEvent subEvent,
[DaprPublish(PubSubName = "%PubSubName%", Topic = "B")] out DaprPubSubEvent pubEvent,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
pubEvent = new DaprPubSubEvent("Transfer from Topic A: " + subEvent.Data);
}
```


Here's the Java code for subscribing to a topic using the Dapr Topic trigger:

```
@FunctionName("PrintTopicMessage")
public String run(
@DaprTopicTrigger(
pubSubName = "%PubSubName%",
topic = "B")
String payload,
final ExecutionContext context) throws JsonProcessingException {
Logger logger = context.getLogger();
logger.info("Java function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.");
```


Use the `app`

object to register the `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('TransferEventBetweenTopics', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'daprTopicTrigger',
name: "subEvent",
pubsubname: "%PubSubName%",
topic: "A"
}),
return: daprPublishOutput,
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node function processed a TransferEventBetweenTopics request from the Dapr Runtime.");
context.log(context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data);
return { payload: context.triggerMetadata.subEvent.data };
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprTopicTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "daprTopicTrigger",
"pubsubname": "%PubSubName%",
"topic": "B",
"name": "subEvent",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$subEvent
)
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $subEvent["data"] | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
Write-Host "Topic B received a message: $jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr Topic trigger, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="PrintTopicMessage")
@app.dapr_topic_trigger(arg_name="subEvent", pub_sub_name="%PubSubName%", topic="B", route="B")
def main(subEvent) -> None:
logging.info('Python function processed a PrintTopicMessage request from the Dapr Runtime.')
subEvent_json = json.loads(subEvent)
logging.info("Topic B received a message: " + subEvent_json["data"])
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprTopicTrigger`

to trigger a Dapr pub/sub binding, which supports the following properties.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
PubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
Topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Annotations

The `DaprTopicTrigger`

annotation allows you to create a function that runs when a topic is received.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
pubSubName |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub. |
topic |
The name of the Dapr topic. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
pubsubname |
The name of the Dapr pub/sub component type. |
topic |
Name of the topic. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties for `@dapp.dapr_topic_trigger`

that you set in your Python code.

| Property | Description | Can be sent via Attribute | Can be sent via RequestBody |
|---|---|---|---|
pub_sub_name |
The name of the Dapr subscription component type. | ✔️ | ❌ |
topic |
The subscription topic. | ✔️ | ❌ |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

To use a Dapr Topic trigger, start by setting up a Dapr pub/sub component. You can learn more about which component to use and how to set it up in the official Dapr documentation.

To use the `daprTopicTrigger`

in Python v2, set up your project with the correct dependencies.

In your

`requirements.text`

file, add the following line:`azure-functions==1.18.0b3`

In the terminal, install the Python library.

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Modify your

`local.setting.json`

file with the following configuration:`"PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES":1`

# Azure Web PubSub output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the *Web PubSub* output binding to invoke Azure Web PubSub service to do something. You can send a message to:

- All connected clients
- Connected clients authenticated to a specific user
- Connected clients joined in a specific group
- A specific client connection

The output binding also allows you to manage clients and groups, and grant/revoke permissions targeting specific connectionId with group.

- Add connection to group
- Add user to group
- Remove connection from a group
- Remove user from a group
- Remove user from all groups
- Close all client connections
- Close a specific client connection
- Close connections in a group
- Grant permission of a connection
- Revoke permission of a connection

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-web-pubsub).

## Example

```
[Function("WebPubSubOutputBinding")]
[WebPubSubOutput(Hub = "<hub>", Connection = "<web_pubsub_connection_name>")]
public static WebPubSubAction Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req)
{
return new SendToAllAction
{
Data = BinaryData.FromString("Hello Web PubSub!"),
DataType = WebPubSubDataType.Text
};
}
```


```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const wpsMsg = output.generic({
type: 'webPubSub',
name: 'actions',
hub: '<hub>',
});
app.http('message', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [wpsMsg],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.extraOutputs.set(wpsMsg, [{
"actionName": "sendToAll",
"data": `Hello world`,
"dataType": `text`
}]);
}
});
```


Note

Complete samples for this language are pending

Note

The Web PubSub extensions for Java is not supported yet.

### WebPubSubAction

`WebPubSubAction`

is the base abstract type of output bindings. The derived types represent the action server want service to invoke.

In C# language, we provide a few static methods under `WebPubSubAction`

to help discover available actions. For example, user can create the `SendToAllAction`

by call `WebPubSubAction.CreateSendToAllAction()`

.

| Derived Class | Properties |
|---|---|
`SendToAllAction` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToGroupAction` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`SendToUserAction` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`SendToConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`AddUserToGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromGroupAction` |
UserId, Group |
`RemoveUserFromAllGroupsAction` |
UserId |
`AddConnectionToGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`RemoveConnectionFromGroupAction` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`CloseAllConnectionsAction` |
Excluded, Reason |
`CloseClientConnectionAction` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`CloseGroupConnectionsAction` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`GrantPermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`RevokePermissionAction` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

** actionName** is the key parameter to resolve the type. Available actions are listed as follows.

| ActionName | Properties |
|---|---|
`sendToAll` |
Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToGroup` |
Group, Data, DataType, Excluded |
`sendToUser` |
UserId, Data, DataType |
`sendToConnection` |
ConnectionId, Data, DataType |
`addUserToGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromGroup` |
UserId, Group |
`removeUserFromAllGroups` |
UserId |
`addConnectionToGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`removeConnectionFromGroup` |
ConnectionId, Group |
`closeAllConnections` |
Excluded, Reason |
`closeClientConnection` |
ConnectionId, Reason |
`closeGroupConnections` |
Group, Excluded, Reason |
`grantPermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |
`revokePermission` |
ConnectionId, Permission, TargetName |

Important

The message data property in the sent message related actions must be `string`

if data type is set to `json`

or `text`

to avoid data conversion ambiguity. Please use `JSON.stringify()`

to convert the json object in need. This is applied to any place using message property, for example, `UserEventResponse.Data`

working with `WebPubSubTrigger`

.

When data type is set to `binary`

, it's allowed to leverage binding naturally supported `dataType`

as `binary`

configured in the `function.json`

, see [Trigger and binding definitions](functions-triggers-bindings?tabs=csharp#trigger-and-binding-definitions) for details.

### Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file and the `WebPubSub`

attribute.

| function.json property | Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|---|
type |
n/a | Must be set to `webPubSub` |
direction |
n/a | Must be set to `out` |
name |
n/a | Variable name used in function code for output binding object. |
hub |
Hub | The value must be set to the name of the Web PubSub hub for the function to be triggered. We support set the value in attribute as higher priority, or it can be set in app settings as a global value. |
connection |
Connection | The name of the app setting that contains the Web PubSub Service connection string (defaults to "WebPubSubConnectionString"). |

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to the Web PubSub service instead of using a connection string, which contains a shared secret key. For more information, see [Authorize a managed identity request by using Microsoft Entra ID](../azure-web-pubsub/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity).

## Troubleshooting

### Setting up console logging

You can also easily [enable console logging](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/core/Azure.Core/samples/Diagnostics.md#logging) if you want to dig deeper into the requests you're making against the service.

# Connect Azure Functions to Azure Storage using command line tools

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you integrate an Azure Storage queue with the function and storage account you created in the previous quickstart article. You achieve this integration by using an *output binding* that writes data from an HTTP request to a message in the queue. Completing this article incurs no extra costs beyond the few USD cents of the previous quickstart. To learn more about bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings).

If you already cleaned up resources at the end of that article, go through the steps again to recreate the function app and related resources in Azure.

### Retrieve the Azure Storage connection string

Important

This article currently shows how to connect to your Azure Storage account by using the connection string, which contains a shared secret key. Using a connection string makes it easier for you to verify data updates in the storage account. For the best security, you should instead use managed identities when connecting to your storage account. For more information, see [Connections](functions-reference#connections) in the Developer Guide.

Earlier, you created an Azure Storage account for function app's use. The connection string for this account is stored securely in app settings in Azure. By downloading the setting into the *local.settings.json* file, you can use the connection to write to a Storage queue in the same account when running the function locally.

From the root of the project, run the following command, replacing

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app from the previous step. This command overwrites any existing values in the file.`func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings <APP_NAME>`

Open

*local.settings.json*file and locate the value named`AzureWebJobsStorage`

, which is the Storage account connection string. You use the name`AzureWebJobsStorage`

and the connection string in other sections of this article.

Important

Because the *local.settings.json* file contains secrets downloaded from Azure, always exclude this file from source control. The *.gitignore* file created with a local functions project excludes the file by default.

## Register binding extensions

Except for HTTP and timer triggers, bindings are implemented as extension packages. Run the following [dotnet add package](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command in the Terminal window to add the Storage extension package to your project.

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues --prerelease
```


Now, you can add the storage output binding to your project.

## Add an output binding definition to the function

Although a function can have only one trigger, it can have multiple input and output bindings, which lets you connect to other Azure services and resources without writing custom integration code.

When using the [Node.js v4 programming model](functions-reference-node), binding attributes are defined directly in the *./src/functions/HttpExample.js* file. From the previous quickstart, your file already contains an HTTP binding defined by the `app.http`

method.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (!name) {
return { status: 404, body: 'Not Found' };
}
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


When using the [Node.js v4 programming model](functions-reference-node), binding attributes are defined directly in the *./src/functions/HttpExample.js* file. From the previous quickstart, your file already contains an HTTP binding defined by the `app.http`

method.

```
import {
app,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
} from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


You declare these bindings in the *function.json* file in your function folder. From the previous quickstart, your *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder contains two bindings in the `bindings`

collection:

When using the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators), binding attributes are defined directly in the *function_app.py* file as decorators. From the previous quickstart, your *function_app.py* file already contains one decorator-based binding:

```
import azure.functions as func
import logging
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="HttpTrigger1")
@app.route(route="hello", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
```


The `route`

decorator adds HttpTrigger and HttpOutput binding to the function, which enables your function be triggered when http requests hit the specified route.

To write to an Azure Storage queue from this function, add the `queue_output`

decorator to your function code:

```
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
```


In the decorator, `arg_name`

identifies the binding parameter referenced in your code, `queue_name`

is name of the queue that the binding writes to, and `connection`

is the name of an application setting that contains the connection string for the Storage account. In quickstarts you use the same storage account as the function app, which is in the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting (from *local.settings.json* file). When the `queue_name`

doesn't exist, the binding creates it on first use.

```
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
}
]
```


To write to an Azure Storage queue:

Add an

`extraOutputs`

property to the binding configuration`{ methods: ['GET', 'POST'], extraOutputs: [sendToQueue], // add output binding to HTTP trigger authLevel: 'anonymous', handler: () => {} }`

Add a

`output.storageQueue`

function above the`app.http`

call`const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({ queueName: 'outqueue', connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage', });`


The second binding in the collection is named `res`

. This `http`

binding is an output binding (`out`

) that is used to write the HTTP response.

To write to an Azure Storage queue from this function, add an `out`

binding of type `queue`

with the name `msg`

, as shown in the code below:

```
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
},
{
"type": "queue",
"direction": "out",
"name": "msg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
}
]
}
```


For a `queue`

type, you must specify the name of the queue in `queueName`

and provide the *name* of the Azure Storage connection (from *local.settings.json* file) in `connection`

.

In a C# project, the bindings are defined as binding attributes on the function method. Specific definitions depend on whether your app runs in-process (C# class library) or in an isolated worker process.

Open the *HttpExample.cs* project file and add the following `MultiResponse`

class:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


The `MultiResponse`

class allows you to write to a storage queue named `outqueue`

and an HTTP success message. Multiple messages could be sent to the queue because the `QueueOutput`

attribute is applied to a string array.

The `Connection`

property sets the connection string for the storage account. In this case, you could omit `Connection`

because you're already using the default storage account.

In a Java project, the bindings are defined as binding annotations on the function method. The *function.json* file is then autogenerated based on these annotations.

Browse to the location of your function code under *src/main/java*, open the *Function.java* project file, and add the following parameter to the `run`

method definition:

```
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg
```


The `msg`

parameter is an [ OutputBinding<T>](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding) type, which represents a collection of strings. These strings are written as messages to an output binding when the function completes. In this case, the output is a storage queue named

`outqueue`

. The connection string for the Storage account is set by the `connection`

method. You pass the application setting that contains the Storage account connection string, rather than passing the connection string itself.The `run`

method definition must now look like the following example:

```
@FunctionName("HttpTrigger-Java")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")
OutputBinding<String> msg, final ExecutionContext context) {
...
}
```


For more information on the details of bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings) and [queue output configuration](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output#configuration).

## Add code to use the output binding

With the queue binding defined, you can now update your function to receive the `msg`

output parameter and write messages to the queue.

Update *HttpExample\function_app.py* to match the following code, add the `msg`

parameter to the function definition and `msg.set(name)`

under the `if name:`

statement:

```
import azure.functions as func
import logging
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
@app.route(route="HttpExample")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
def HttpExample(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out [func.QueueMessage]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
name = req.params.get('name')
if not name:
try:
req_body = req.get_json()
except ValueError:
pass
else:
name = req_body.get('name')
if name:
msg.set(name)
return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.")
else:
return func.HttpResponse(
"This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.",
status_code=200
)
```


The `msg`

parameter is an instance of the [ azure.functions.Out class](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out). The

`set`

method writes a string message to the queue. In this case, it's the `name`

passed to the function in the URL query string.Add code that uses the output binding object on `context.extraOutputs`

to create a queue message. Add this code before the return statement.

```
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
```


At this point, your function could look as follows:

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


Add code that uses the output binding object on `context.extraOutputs`

to create a queue message. Add this code before the return statement.

```
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
```


At this point, your function could look as follows:

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


Add code that uses the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet to write text to the queue using the `msg`

output binding. Add this code before you set the OK status in the `if`

statement.

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
```


At this point, your function must look as follows:

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$name = $Request.Query.Name
if (-not $name) {
$name = $Request.Body.Name
}
if ($name) {
# Write the $name value to the queue,
# which is the name passed to the function.
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
$status = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
$body = "Hello $name"
}
else {
$status = [HttpStatusCode]::BadRequest
$body = "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body."
}
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = $status
Body = $body
})
```


Replace the existing `HttpExample`

class with the following code:

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
var logger = executionContext.GetLogger("HttpExample");
logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
var message = "Welcome to Azure Functions!";
var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8");
response.WriteString(message);
// Return a response to both HTTP trigger and storage output binding.
return new MultiResponse()
{
// Write a single message.
Messages = new string[] { message },
HttpResponse = response
};
}
}
```


Now, you can use the new `msg`

parameter to write to the output binding from your function code. Add the following line of code before the success response to add the value of `name`

to the `msg`

output binding.

```
msg.setValue(name);
```


When you use an output binding, you don't have to use the Azure Storage SDK code for authentication, getting a queue reference, or writing data. The Functions runtime and queue output binding do those tasks for you.

Your `run`

method must now look like the following example:

```
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
// Parse query parameter
String query = request.getQueryParameters().get("name");
String name = request.getBody().orElse(query);
if (name == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body").build();
} else {
// Write the name to the message queue.
msg.setValue(name);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
}
```


## Update the tests

Because the archetype also creates a set of tests, you need to update these tests to handle the new `msg`

parameter in the `run`

method signature.

Browse to the location of your test code under *src/test/java*, open the *Function.java* project file, and replace the line of code under `//Invoke`

with the following code:

```
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
final OutputBinding<String> msg = (OutputBinding<String>)mock(OutputBinding.class);
final HttpResponseMessage ret = new Function().run(req, msg, context);
```


Observe that you *don't* need to write any code for authentication, getting a queue reference, or writing data. All these integration tasks are conveniently handled in the Azure Functions runtime and queue output binding.

## Run the function locally

Run your function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host from the

*LocalFunctionProj*folder.`func start`

Toward the end of the output, the following lines must appear:

Note

If HttpExample doesn't appear as shown above, you likely started the host from outside the root folder of the project. In that case, use

**Ctrl**+**C**to stop the host, go to the project's root folder, and run the previous command again.Copy the URL of your HTTP function from this output to a browser and append the query string

`?name=<YOUR_NAME>`

, making the full URL like`http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser should display a response message that echoes back your query string value. The terminal in which you started your project also shows log output as you make requests.When you're done, press

`Ctrl + C`and type`y`

to stop the functions host.

## View the message in the Azure Storage queue

You can view the queue in the [Azure portal](../storage/queues/storage-quickstart-queues-portal) or in the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/). You can also view the queue in the Azure CLI, as described in the following steps:

Open the function project's

*local.setting.json*file and copy the connection string value. In a terminal or command window, run the following command to create an environment variable named`AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`

, and paste your specific connection string in place of`<MY_CONNECTION_STRING>`

. (This environment variable means you don't need to supply the connection string to each subsequent command using the`--connection-string`

argument.)`export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="<MY_CONNECTION_STRING>"`

(Optional) Use the

command to view the Storage queues in your account. The output from this command must include a queue named`az storage queue list`

`outqueue`

, which was created when the function wrote its first message to that queue.`az storage queue list --output tsv`

Use the

command to read the message from this queue, which should be the value you supplied when testing the function earlier. The command reads and removes the first message from the queue.`az storage message get`

`echo `echo $(az storage message get --queue-name outqueue -o tsv --query '[].{Message:content}') | base64 --decode``

Because the message body is stored

[base64 encoded](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#encoding), the message must be decoded before it's displayed. After you execute`az storage message get`

, the message is removed from the queue. If there was only one message in`outqueue`

, you won't retrieve a message when you run this command a second time and instead get an error.

## Redeploy the project to Azure

After you verify locally that the function wrote a message to the Azure Storage queue, you can redeploy your project to update the endpoint running on Azure.

In the *LocalFunctionsProj* folder, use the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local#project-file-deployment) command to redeploy the project, replacing

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your app.```
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```


In the local project folder, use the following Maven command to republish your project:

```
mvn azure-functions:deploy
```


## Verify in Azure

As in the previous quickstart, use a browser or CURL to test the redeployed function.

Examine the Storage queue again, as described in the previous section, to verify that it contains the new message written to the queue.


## Clean up resources

After you finish, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```


## Next steps

You've updated your HTTP triggered function to write data to a Storage queue. Now you can learn more about developing Functions from the command line using Core Tools and Azure CLI:

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you integrate an Azure Storage queue with the function and storage account you created in the previous quickstart article. You achieve this integration by using an *output binding* that writes data from an HTTP request to a message in the queue. Completing this article incurs no extra costs beyond the few USD cents of the previous quickstart.

### Retrieve the Azure Storage connection string

Important

This article currently shows how to connect to your Azure Storage account by using the connection string, which contains a shared secret key. Using a connection string makes it easier for you to verify data updates in the storage account. For the best security, you should instead use managed identities when connecting to your storage account. For more information, see [Connections](functions-reference#connections) in the Developer Guide.

Earlier, you created an Azure Storage account for function app's use. The connection string for this account is stored securely in app settings in Azure. By downloading the setting into the *local.settings.json* file, you can use the connection to write to a Storage queue in the same account when running the function locally.

From the root of the project, run the following command, replacing

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your function app from the previous step. This command overwrites any existing values in the file.`func azure functionapp fetch-app-settings <APP_NAME>`

Open

*local.settings.json*file and locate the value named`AzureWebJobsStorage`

, which is the Storage account connection string. You use the name`AzureWebJobsStorage`

and the connection string in other sections of this article.

Important

Because the *local.settings.json* file contains secrets downloaded from Azure, always exclude this file from source control. The *.gitignore* file created with a local functions project excludes the file by default.

## Register binding extensions

Except for HTTP and timer triggers, bindings are implemented as extension packages. Run the following [dotnet add package](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command in the Terminal window to add the Storage extension package to your project.

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Storage.Queues --prerelease
```


Now, you can add the storage output binding to your project.

## Add an output binding definition to the function

Although a function can have only one trigger, it can have multiple input and output bindings, which lets you connect to other Azure services and resources without writing custom integration code.

When using the [Node.js v4 programming model](functions-reference-node), binding attributes are defined directly in the *./src/functions/HttpExample.js* file. From the previous quickstart, your file already contains an HTTP binding defined by the `app.http`

method.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (!name) {
return { status: 404, body: 'Not Found' };
}
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


When using the [Node.js v4 programming model](functions-reference-node), binding attributes are defined directly in the *./src/functions/HttpExample.js* file. From the previous quickstart, your file already contains an HTTP binding defined by the `app.http`

method.

```
import {
app,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
} from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


You declare these bindings in the *function.json* file in your function folder. From the previous quickstart, your *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder contains two bindings in the `bindings`

collection:

When using the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators), binding attributes are defined directly in the *function_app.py* file as decorators. From the previous quickstart, your *function_app.py* file already contains one decorator-based binding:

```
import azure.functions as func
import logging
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="HttpTrigger1")
@app.route(route="hello", auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
```


The `route`

decorator adds HttpTrigger and HttpOutput binding to the function, which enables your function be triggered when http requests hit the specified route.

To write to an Azure Storage queue from this function, add the `queue_output`

decorator to your function code:

```
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
```


In the decorator, `arg_name`

identifies the binding parameter referenced in your code, `queue_name`

is name of the queue that the binding writes to, and `connection`

is the name of an application setting that contains the connection string for the Storage account. In quickstarts you use the same storage account as the function app, which is in the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting (from *local.settings.json* file). When the `queue_name`

doesn't exist, the binding creates it on first use.

```
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
}
]
```


To write to an Azure Storage queue:

Add an

`extraOutputs`

property to the binding configuration`{ methods: ['GET', 'POST'], extraOutputs: [sendToQueue], // add output binding to HTTP trigger authLevel: 'anonymous', handler: () => {} }`

Add a

`output.storageQueue`

function above the`app.http`

call`const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({ queueName: 'outqueue', connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage', });`


The second binding in the collection is named `res`

. This `http`

binding is an output binding (`out`

) that is used to write the HTTP response.

To write to an Azure Storage queue from this function, add an `out`

binding of type `queue`

with the name `msg`

, as shown in the code below:

```
{
"authLevel": "function",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
},
{
"type": "queue",
"direction": "out",
"name": "msg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
}
]
}
```


For a `queue`

type, you must specify the name of the queue in `queueName`

and provide the *name* of the Azure Storage connection (from *local.settings.json* file) in `connection`

.

In a C# project, the bindings are defined as binding attributes on the function method. Specific definitions depend on whether your app runs in-process (C# class library) or in an isolated worker process.

Open the *HttpExample.cs* project file and add the following `MultiResponse`

class:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


The `MultiResponse`

class allows you to write to a storage queue named `outqueue`

and an HTTP success message. Multiple messages could be sent to the queue because the `QueueOutput`

attribute is applied to a string array.

The `Connection`

property sets the connection string for the storage account. In this case, you could omit `Connection`

because you're already using the default storage account.

In a Java project, the bindings are defined as binding annotations on the function method. The *function.json* file is then autogenerated based on these annotations.

Browse to the location of your function code under *src/main/java*, open the *Function.java* project file, and add the following parameter to the `run`

method definition:

```
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg
```


The `msg`

parameter is an [ OutputBinding<T>](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding) type, which represents a collection of strings. These strings are written as messages to an output binding when the function completes. In this case, the output is a storage queue named

`outqueue`

. The connection string for the Storage account is set by the `connection`

method. You pass the application setting that contains the Storage account connection string, rather than passing the connection string itself.The `run`

method definition must now look like the following example:

```
@FunctionName("HttpTrigger-Java")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")
OutputBinding<String> msg, final ExecutionContext context) {
...
}
```


For more information on the details of bindings, see [Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts](functions-triggers-bindings) and [queue output configuration](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output#configuration).

## Add code to use the output binding

With the queue binding defined, you can now update your function to receive the `msg`

output parameter and write messages to the queue.

Update *HttpExample\function_app.py* to match the following code, add the `msg`

parameter to the function definition and `msg.set(name)`

under the `if name:`

statement:

```
import azure.functions as func
import logging
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.ANONYMOUS)
@app.route(route="HttpExample")
@app.queue_output(arg_name="msg", queue_name="outqueue", connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
def HttpExample(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out [func.QueueMessage]) -> func.HttpResponse:
logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')
name = req.params.get('name')
if not name:
try:
req_body = req.get_json()
except ValueError:
pass
else:
name = req_body.get('name')
if name:
msg.set(name)
return func.HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.")
else:
return func.HttpResponse(
"This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.",
status_code=200
)
```


The `msg`

parameter is an instance of the [ azure.functions.Out class](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out). The

`set`

method writes a string message to the queue. In this case, it's the `name`

passed to the function in the URL query string.Add code that uses the output binding object on `context.extraOutputs`

to create a queue message. Add this code before the return statement.

```
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
```


At this point, your function could look as follows:

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],
handler: async (request, context) => {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


Add code that uses the output binding object on `context.extraOutputs`

to create a queue message. Add this code before the return statement.

```
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
```


At this point, your function could look as follows:

```
import {
app,
output,
HttpRequest,
HttpResponseInit,
InvocationContext,
StorageQueueOutput,
} from '@azure/functions';
const sendToQueue: StorageQueueOutput = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
export async function HttpExample(
request: HttpRequest,
context: InvocationContext,
): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());
context.log(`Name: ${name}`);
if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
}
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: HttpExample,
});
```


Add code that uses the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet to write text to the queue using the `msg`

output binding. Add this code before you set the OK status in the `if`

statement.

```
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
```


At this point, your function must look as follows:

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$name = $Request.Query.Name
if (-not $name) {
$name = $Request.Body.Name
}
if ($name) {
# Write the $name value to the queue,
# which is the name passed to the function.
$outputMsg = $name
Push-OutputBinding -name msg -Value $outputMsg
$status = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
$body = "Hello $name"
}
else {
$status = [HttpStatusCode]::BadRequest
$body = "Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body."
}
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = $status
Body = $body
})
```


Replace the existing `HttpExample`

class with the following code:

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
var logger = executionContext.GetLogger("HttpExample");
logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
var message = "Welcome to Azure Functions!";
var response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8");
response.WriteString(message);
// Return a response to both HTTP trigger and storage output binding.
return new MultiResponse()
{
// Write a single message.
Messages = new string[] { message },
HttpResponse = response
};
}
}
```


Now, you can use the new `msg`

parameter to write to the output binding from your function code. Add the following line of code before the success response to add the value of `name`

to the `msg`

output binding.

```
msg.setValue(name);
```


When you use an output binding, you don't have to use the Azure Storage SDK code for authentication, getting a queue reference, or writing data. The Functions runtime and queue output binding do those tasks for you.

Your `run`

method must now look like the following example:

```
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java HTTP trigger processed a request.");
// Parse query parameter
String query = request.getQueryParameters().get("name");
String name = request.getBody().orElse(query);
if (name == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body").build();
} else {
// Write the name to the message queue.
msg.setValue(name);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
}
```


## Update the tests

Because the archetype also creates a set of tests, you need to update these tests to handle the new `msg`

parameter in the `run`

method signature.

Browse to the location of your test code under *src/test/java*, open the *Function.java* project file, and replace the line of code under `//Invoke`

with the following code:

```
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
final OutputBinding<String> msg = (OutputBinding<String>)mock(OutputBinding.class);
final HttpResponseMessage ret = new Function().run(req, msg, context);
```


Observe that you *don't* need to write any code for authentication, getting a queue reference, or writing data. All these integration tasks are conveniently handled in the Azure Functions runtime and queue output binding.

## Run the function locally

Run your function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host from the

*LocalFunctionProj*folder.`func start`

Toward the end of the output, the following lines must appear:

Note

If HttpExample doesn't appear as shown above, you likely started the host from outside the root folder of the project. In that case, use

**Ctrl**+**C**to stop the host, go to the project's root folder, and run the previous command again.Copy the URL of your HTTP function from this output to a browser and append the query string

`?name=<YOUR_NAME>`

, making the full URL like`http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser should display a response message that echoes back your query string value. The terminal in which you started your project also shows log output as you make requests.When you're done, press

`Ctrl + C`and type`y`

to stop the functions host.

## View the message in the Azure Storage queue

You can view the queue in the [Azure portal](../storage/queues/storage-quickstart-queues-portal) or in the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/). You can also view the queue in the Azure CLI, as described in the following steps:

Open the function project's

*local.setting.json*file and copy the connection string value. In a terminal or command window, run the following command to create an environment variable named`AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`

, and paste your specific connection string in place of`<MY_CONNECTION_STRING>`

. (This environment variable means you don't need to supply the connection string to each subsequent command using the`--connection-string`

argument.)`export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="<MY_CONNECTION_STRING>"`

(Optional) Use the

command to view the Storage queues in your account. The output from this command must include a queue named`az storage queue list`

`outqueue`

, which was created when the function wrote its first message to that queue.`az storage queue list --output tsv`

Use the

command to read the message from this queue, which should be the value you supplied when testing the function earlier. The command reads and removes the first message from the queue.`az storage message get`

`echo `echo $(az storage message get --queue-name outqueue -o tsv --query '[].{Message:content}') | base64 --decode``

Because the message body is stored

[base64 encoded](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#encoding), the message must be decoded before it's displayed. After you execute`az storage message get`

, the message is removed from the queue. If there was only one message in`outqueue`

, you won't retrieve a message when you run this command a second time and instead get an error.

## Redeploy the project to Azure

After you verify locally that the function wrote a message to the Azure Storage queue, you can redeploy your project to update the endpoint running on Azure.

In the *LocalFunctionsProj* folder, use the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-run-local#project-file-deployment) command to redeploy the project, replacing

`<APP_NAME>`

with the name of your app.```
func azure functionapp publish <APP_NAME>
```


In the local project folder, use the following Maven command to republish your project:

```
mvn azure-functions:deploy
```


## Verify in Azure

As in the previous quickstart, use a browser or CURL to test the redeployed function.

Examine the Storage queue again, as described in the previous section, to verify that it contains the new message written to the queue.


## Clean up resources

After you finish, use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```
az group delete --name AzureFunctionsQuickstart-rg
```


## Next steps

You've updated your HTTP triggered function to write data to a Storage queue. Now you can learn more about developing Functions from the command line using Core Tools and Azure CLI:

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The output binding allows you to modify and delete blob storage data in an Azure Function.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-storage-blob).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

The following example is a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that runs in an isolated worker process and uses a blob trigger with both blob input and blob output blob bindings. The function is triggered by the creation of a blob in the *test-samples-trigger* container. It reads a text file from the *test-samples-input* container and creates a new text file in an output container based on the name of the triggered file.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace SampleApp
{
public static class BlobFunction
{
[Function(nameof(BlobFunction))]
[BlobOutput("test-samples-output/{name}-output.txt")]
public static string Run(
[BlobTrigger("test-samples-trigger/{name}")] string myTriggerItem,
[BlobInput("test-samples-input/sample1.txt")] string myBlob,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger("BlobFunction");
logger.LogInformation("Triggered Item = {myTriggerItem}", myTriggerItem);
logger.LogInformation("Input Item = {myBlob}", myBlob);
// Blob Output
return "blob-output content";
}
}
}
```


This section contains the following examples:

#### HTTP trigger, using OutputBinding (Java)

The following example shows a Java function that uses the `HttpTrigger`

annotation to receive a parameter containing the name of a file in a blob storage container. The `BlobInput`

annotation then reads the file and passes its contents to the function as a `byte[]`

. The `BlobOutput`

annotation binds to `OutputBinding outputItem`

, which is then used by the function to write the contents of the input blob to the configured storage container.

```
@FunctionName("copyBlobHttp")
@StorageAccount("Storage_Account_Connection_String")
public HttpResponseMessage copyBlobHttp(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@BlobInput(
name = "file",
dataType = "binary",
path = "samples-workitems/{Query.file}")
byte[] content,
@BlobOutput(
name = "target",
path = "myblob/{Query.file}-CopyViaHttp")
OutputBinding<String> outputItem,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Save blob to outputItem
outputItem.setValue(new String(content, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
// build HTTP response with size of requested blob
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.body("The size of \"" + request.getQueryParameters().get("file") + "\" is: " + content.length + " bytes")
.build();
}
```


#### Queue trigger, using function return value (Java)

The following example shows a Java function that uses the `QueueTrigger`

annotation to receive a message containing the name of a file in a blob storage container. The `BlobInput`

annotation then reads the file and passes its contents to the function as a `byte[]`

. The `BlobOutput`

annotation binds to the function return value, which is then used by the runtime to write the contents of the input blob to the configured storage container.

```
@FunctionName("copyBlobQueueTrigger")
@StorageAccount("Storage_Account_Connection_String")
@BlobOutput(
name = "target",
path = "myblob/{queueTrigger}-Copy")
public String copyBlobQueue(
@QueueTrigger(
name = "filename",
dataType = "string",
queueName = "myqueue-items")
String filename,
@BlobInput(
name = "file",
path = "samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}")
String content,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("The content of \"" + filename + "\" is: " + content);
return content;
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@BlobOutput`

annotation on function parameters whose value would be written to an object in blob storage. The parameter type should be `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is any native Java type or a POJO.

The following example shows a queue triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that makes a copy of a blob. The function is triggered by a queue message that contains the name of the blob to copy. The new blob is named *{originalblobname}-Copy*.

```
import { app, input, InvocationContext, output } from '@azure/functions';
const blobInput = input.storageBlob({
path: 'samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
const blobOutput = output.storageBlob({
path: 'samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}-Copy',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
export async function storageQueueTrigger1(queueItem: unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<unknown> {
return context.extraInputs.get(blobInput);
}
app.storageQueue('storageQueueTrigger1', {
queueName: 'myqueue-items',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
extraInputs: [blobInput],
return: blobOutput,
handler: storageQueueTrigger1,
});
```


The following example shows a queue triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that makes a copy of a blob. The function is triggered by a queue message that contains the name of the blob to copy. The new blob is named *{originalblobname}-Copy*.

```
const { app, input, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const blobInput = input.storageBlob({
path: 'samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
const blobOutput = output.storageBlob({
path: 'samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}-Copy',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
app.storageQueue('storageQueueTrigger1', {
queueName: 'myqueue-items',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
extraInputs: [blobInput],
return: blobOutput,
handler: (queueItem, context) => {
return context.extraInputs.get(blobInput);
},
});
```


The following example demonstrates how to create a copy of an incoming blob as the output from a [PowerShell function](functions-reference-powershell).

In the function's configuration file (*function.json*), the `trigger`

metadata property is used to specify the output blob name in the `path`

properties.

Note

To avoid infinite loops, make sure your input and output paths are different.

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "myInputBlob",
"path": "data/{trigger}",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
"direction": "in",
"type": "blobTrigger"
},
{
"name": "myOutputBlob",
"type": "blob",
"path": "data/copy/{trigger}",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
"direction": "out"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


Here's the PowerShell code:

```
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param([byte[]] $myInputBlob, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "PowerShell Blob trigger function Processed blob Name: $($TriggerMetadata.Name)"
Push-OutputBinding -Name myOutputBlob -Value $myInputBlob
```


The following example shows blob input and output bindings. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

The code creates a copy of a blob.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="BlobOutput1")
@app.route(route="file")
@app.blob_input(arg_name="inputblob",
path="sample-workitems/test.txt",
connection="<BLOB_CONNECTION_SETTING>")
@app.blob_output(arg_name="outputblob",
path="newblob/test.txt",
connection="<BLOB_CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, inputblob: str, outputblob: func.Out[str]):
logging.info(f'Python Queue trigger function processed {len(inputblob)} bytes')
outputblob.set(inputblob)
return "ok"
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#blob-output).

The `BlobOutputAttribute`

constructor takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
BlobPath |
The path to the blob. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Blobs. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using decorators, the following properties on the `blob_input`

and `blob_output`

decorators define the Blob Storage triggers:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the blob in function code. |
`path` |
The path to the blob For the `blob_input` decorator, it's the blob read. For the `blob_output` decorator, it's the output or copy of the input blob. |
`connection` |
The storage account connection string. |
`dataType` |
For dynamically typed languages, specifies the underlying data type. Possible values are `string` , `binary` , or `stream` . For more detail, refer to the
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The `@BlobOutput`

attribute gives you access to the blob that triggered the function. If you use a byte array with the attribute, set `dataType`

to `binary`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.storageBlob()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
path |
The path to the blob container. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Blobs. See
|

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `blob` . |
direction |
Must be set to `out` for an output binding. Exceptions are noted in the
|
name |
The name of the variable that represents the blob in function code. Set to `$return` to reference the function return value. |
path |
The path to the blob container. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Azure Blobs. See
|

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The binding types supported by blob output depend on the extension package version and the C# modality used in your function app.

When you want the function to write to a single blob, the blob output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The blob content as a string. Use when the blob content is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the blob content. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the content of a JSON blob. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write to multiple blobs, the blob output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single blob output binding types |
An array containing content for multiple blobs. Each entry represents the content of one blob. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [BlobClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobclient) or [BlobContainerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs.blobcontainerclient) with other types from [Azure.Storage.Blobs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.storage.blobs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

Binding to `string`

, or `Byte[]`

is only recommended when the blob size is small. This is recommended because the entire blob contents are loaded into memory. For most blobs, use a `Stream`

or `BlobClient`

type. For more information, see [Concurrency and memory usage](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#memory-usage-and-concurrency).

If you get an error message when trying to bind to one of the Storage SDK types, make sure that you have a reference to [the correct Storage SDK version](functions-bindings-storage-blob#tabpanel_2_functionsv1_in-process).

You can also use the [StorageAccountAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs/StorageAccountAttribute.cs) to specify the storage account to use. You can do this when you need to use a different storage account than other functions in the library. The constructor takes the name of an app setting that contains a storage connection string. The attribute can be applied at the parameter, method, or class level. The following example shows class level and method level:

```
[StorageAccount("ClassLevelStorageAppSetting")]
public static class AzureFunctions
{
[FunctionName("BlobTrigger")]
[StorageAccount("FunctionLevelStorageAppSetting")]
public static void Run( //...
{
....
}
```


The storage account to use is determined in the following order:

- The
`BlobTrigger`

attribute's`Connection`

property. - The
`StorageAccount`

attribute applied to the same parameter as the`BlobTrigger`

attribute. - The
`StorageAccount`

attribute applied to the function. - The
`StorageAccount`

attribute applied to the class. - The default storage account for the function app, which is defined in the
`AzureWebJobsStorage`

application setting.

The `@BlobOutput`

attribute gives you access to the blob that triggered the function. If you use a byte array with the attribute, set `dataType`

to `binary`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

Access the blob data via a parameter that matches the name designated by binding's name parameter in the *function.json* file.

You can declare function parameters as the following types to write out to blob storage:

- Strings as
`func.Out[str]`

- Streams as
`func.Out[func.InputStream]`


Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration that specifies how the app should connect to Azure Blobs. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Manage storage account access keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage). The connection string must be for a general-purpose storage account, not a [Blob storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts).

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name here. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyStorage", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyStorage". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Storage connection string in the app setting that is named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-storage-blob#install-extension) ([bundle 3.x or higher](functions-bindings-storage-blob?tabs=extensionv3#install-bundle) for non-.NET language stacks), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To use an identity, you define settings under a common prefix that maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

If you're setting `connection`

to "AzureWebJobsStorage", see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). For all other connections, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blob Service URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri` 1 |
The data plane URI of the blob service to which you're connecting, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net |

1 `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__blobServiceUri`

can be used as an alias. If the connection configuration will be used by a blob trigger, `blobServiceUri`

must also be accompanied by `queueServiceUri`

. See below.

The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables. The URI can only designate the blob service. As an alternative, you can provide a URI specifically for each service, allowing a single connection to be used. If both versions are provided, the multi-service form is used. To configure the connection for multiple services, instead of `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri`

, set:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blob Service URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__blobServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of the blob service to which you're connecting, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net |
Queue Service URI (required for blob triggers2) |
`<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__queueServiceUri` |
The data plane URI of a queue service, using the HTTPS scheme. This value is only needed for blob triggers. | https://<storage_account_name>.queue.core.windows.net |

2 The blob trigger handles failure across multiple retries by writing [poison blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs) to a queue. In the `serviceUri`

form, the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection is used. However, when specifying `blobServiceUri`

, a queue service URI must also be provided with `queueServiceUri`

. It's recommended that you use the service from the same storage account as the blob service. You also need to make sure the trigger can read and write messages in the configured queue service by assigning a role like [Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor).

Other properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You need to create a role assignment that provides access to your blob container at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Blob Storage extension in normal operation. Your application may require further permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
and
1Extra permissions must also be granted to the AzureWebJobsStorage connection. 2 |

[Storage Blob Data Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader)[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)1 The blob trigger handles failure across multiple retries by writing [poison blobs](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#poison-blobs) to a queue on the storage account specified by the connection.

2 The AzureWebJobsStorage connection is used internally for blobs and queues that enable the trigger. If it's configured to use an identity-based connection, it needs extra permissions beyond the default requirement. The required permissions are covered by the [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner), [Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor), and [Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) roles. To learn more, see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity).
