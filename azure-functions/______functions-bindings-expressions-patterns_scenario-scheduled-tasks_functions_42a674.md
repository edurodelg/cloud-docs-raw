# Azure Functions binding expressions and patterns

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

One of the most powerful features of [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) in Azure Functions is *binding expressions*. In the `function.json`

file and in function parameters and code, you can use expressions that resolve to values from various sources.

Most expressions are wrapped in curly braces. For example, in a queue trigger function, `{queueTrigger}`

resolves to the queue message text. If the `path`

property for a blob output binding is `container/{queueTrigger}`

and a queue message `HelloWorld`

triggers the function, a blob named `HelloWorld`

is created.

App settings

It's a best practice to manage secrets and connection strings by using app settings rather than configuration files. This practice limits access to these secrets and makes it safe to store files such as `function.json`

in public source-control repositories.

App settings are also useful whenever you want to change a configuration based on the environment. For example, in a test environment, you might want to monitor a different container for queue storage or blob storage.

Binding expressions for app settings are identified differently from other binding expressions: they're wrapped in percent signs rather than curly braces. For example, if the path for a blob output binding is `%Environment%/newblob.txt`

and the `Environment`

app setting value is `Development`

, a blob is created in the `Development`

container.

When a function is running locally, values for app settings come from the `local.settings.json`

file.

Note

The `connection`

property of triggers and bindings is a special case and automatically resolves values as app settings, without percent signs.

The following example is an Azure Queue Storage trigger that uses an app setting `%input_queue_name%`

to define the queue to trigger on:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "order",
"type": "queueTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"queueName": "%input_queue_name%",
"connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
}
]
}
```


You can use the same approach in class libraries:

```
[FunctionName("QueueTrigger")]
public static void Run(
[QueueTrigger("%input_queue_name%")]string myQueueItem,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
}
```


## Trigger file name

The `path`

value for a blob trigger can be a pattern that lets you refer to the name of the triggering blob in other bindings and function code. The pattern can also include filtering criteria that specify which blobs can trigger a function invocation.

For example, in the following binding for a blob trigger, the `path`

pattern is `sample-images/{filename}`

. This pattern creates a binding expression named `filename`

.

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "image",
"type": "blobTrigger",
"path": "sample-images/{filename}",
"direction": "in",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection"
},
...
```


You can then use the expression `filename`

in an output binding to specify the name of the blob that you're creating:

```
...
{
"name": "imageSmall",
"type": "blob",
"path": "sample-images-sm/{filename}",
"direction": "out",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection"
}
],
}
```


Function code has access to this same value by using `filename`

as a parameter name:

```
// C# example of binding to {filename}
public static void Run(Stream image, string filename, Stream imageSmall, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"Blob trigger processing: {filename}");
// ...
}
```


The same ability to use binding expressions and patterns applies to attributes in class libraries. In the following example, the attribute constructor parameters are the same `path`

values as the preceding `function.json`

examples:

```
[FunctionName("ResizeImage")]
public static void Run(
[BlobTrigger("sample-images/{filename}")] Stream image,
[Blob("sample-images-sm/{filename}", FileAccess.Write)] Stream imageSmall,
string filename,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"Blob trigger processing: {filename}");
// ...
}
```


You can also create expressions for parts of the file name. In the following example, the function is triggered only on file names that match a pattern: `anyname-anyfile.csv`

.

```
{
"name": "myBlob",
"type": "blobTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"path": "testContainerName/{date}-{filetype}.csv",
"connection": "OrderStorageConnection"
}
```


For more information on how to use expressions and patterns in the blob path string, see the [reference for Azure Blob Storage bindings](functions-bindings-storage-blob).

## Trigger metadata

In addition to the data payload that a trigger provides (such as the content of the queue message that triggered a function), many triggers provide other metadata values. You can use these values as input parameters in C# and F# or as properties on the `context.bindings`

object in JavaScript.

For example, an Azure Queue Storage trigger supports the following properties:

`QueueTrigger`

(triggering message content if the string is valid)`DequeueCount`

`ExpirationTime`

`Id`

`InsertionTime`

`NextVisibleTime`

`PopReceipt`


These metadata values are accessible in the `function.json`

file properties. For example, suppose you use a queue trigger and the queue message contains the name of a blob that you want to read. In the `function.json`

file, you can use the `queueTrigger`

metadata property in the blob `path`

property, as shown in the following example:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "myQueueItem",
"type": "queueTrigger",
"queueName": "myqueue-items",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection",
},
{
"name": "myInputBlob",
"type": "blob",
"path": "samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}",
"direction": "in",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection"
}
]
}
```


You can find details of metadata properties for each trigger in the corresponding reference article. For an example, see the [metadata for an Azure Queue Storage trigger](functions-bindings-storage-queue-trigger#message-metadata). Documentation is also available on the **Integrate** tab of the portal, in the **Documentation** section below the binding configuration area.

## JSON payloads

In some scenarios, you can refer to the trigger payload's properties in the configuration for other bindings in the same function and in function code. This approach requires that the trigger payload is JSON and is smaller than a threshold specific to each trigger. Typically, the payload size needs to be less than 100 MB, but you should check the reference content for each trigger.

Using trigger payload properties might affect the performance of your application. It also forces the trigger parameter type to be a simple type (like a string) or a custom object type that represents JSON data. You can't use it with streams, clients, or other SDK types.

The following example shows the `function.json`

file for a webhook function that receives a blob name in JSON: `{"BlobName":"HelloWorld.txt"}`

. A blob input binding reads the blob, and the HTTP output binding returns the blob contents in the HTTP response. Notice that the blob input binding gets the blob name by referring directly to the `BlobName`

property (`"path": "strings/{BlobName}"`

).

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "info",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"webHookType": "genericJson"
},
{
"name": "blobContents",
"type": "blob",
"direction": "in",
"path": "strings/{BlobName}",
"connection": "AzureWebJobsStorage"
},
{
"name": "res",
"type": "http",
"direction": "out"
}
]
}
```


For this approach to work in C# and F#, you need a class that defines the fields to be deserialized, as in the following example:

```
using System.Net;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
public class BlobInfo
{
public string BlobName { get; set; }
}
public static HttpResponseMessage Run(HttpRequestMessage req, BlobInfo info, string blobContents, ILogger log)
{
if (blobContents == null) {
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
}
log.LogInformation($"Processing: {info.BlobName}");
return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, new {
data = $"{blobContents}"
});
}
```


In JavaScript, JSON deserialization is automatically performed:

```
module.exports = async function (context, info) {
if ('BlobName' in info) {
context.res = {
body: { 'data': context.bindings.blobContents }
}
}
else {
context.res = {
status: 404
};
}
}
```


### Dot notation

If some of the properties in your JSON payload are objects with properties, you can refer to them directly by using dot (`.`

) notation. This notation doesn't work for [Azure Cosmos DB](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2) or [Azure Table Storage](functions-bindings-storage-table-output) bindings.

For example, suppose your JSON looks like this example:

```
{
"BlobName": {
"FileName":"HelloWorld",
"Extension":"txt"
}
}
```


You can refer directly to `FileName`

as `BlobName.FileName`

. With this JSON format, here's what the `path`

property in the preceding example would look like:

```
"path": "strings/{BlobName.FileName}.{BlobName.Extension}",
```


In C#, you would need two classes:

```
public class BlobInfo
{
public BlobName BlobName { get; set; }
}
public class BlobName
{
public string FileName { get; set; }
public string Extension { get; set; }
}
```


## New GUIDs

The `{rand-guid}`

binding expression creates a GUID. The following blob path in a `function.json`

file creates a blob with a name like *50710cb5-84b9-4d87-9d83-a03d6976a682.txt*:

```
{
"type": "blob",
"name": "blobOutput",
"direction": "out",
"path": "my-output-container/{rand-guid}.txt"
}
```


## Current date and time

The binding expression `DateTime`

resolves to `DateTime.UtcNow`

. The following blob path in a `function.json`

file creates a blob with a name like *2018-02-16T17-59-55Z.txt*:

```
{
"type": "blob",
"name": "blobOutput",
"direction": "out",
"path": "my-output-container/{DateTime}.txt"
}
```


## Binding at runtime

In C# and other .NET languages, you can use an imperative binding pattern, as opposed to the declarative bindings in `function.json`

and attributes. Imperative binding is useful when binding parameters need to be computed at runtime rather than design time. To learn more, see the [C# developer reference](functions-dotnet-class-library#binding-at-runtime) or the [C# script developer reference](functions-reference-csharp#binding-at-runtime).

# Quickstart: Run scheduled tasks using Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`

) to create a Timer trigger function to run a scheduled task in Azure Functions. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to a new serverless function app you create running in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions.

The project source uses `azd`

to create the function app and related resources and to deploy your code to Azure. This deployment follows current best practices for secure and scalable Azure Functions deployments.

By default, the Flex Consumption plan follows a *pay-for-what-you-use* billing model, which means you can complete this article and only incur a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Important

While [running scheduled tasks](functions-bindings-timer) is supported for all languages, this quickstart scenario currently only has examples for C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete this quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/)or above

[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/)or above

An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Initialize the project

Use the `azd init`

command to create a local Azure Functions code project from a template.

In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-timer -e scheduled-dotnet`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-timer)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name is also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.Run this command to navigate to the app folder:

`cd src`

Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated", "TIMER_SCHEDULE": "*/30 * * * * *" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-timer -e scheduled-ts`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-timer)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name is also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node", "TIMER_SCHEDULE": "*/30 * * * * *" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


In your local terminal or command prompt, run this

`azd init`

command in an empty folder:`azd init --template functions-quickstart-python-azd-timer -e scheduled-py`

This command pulls the project files from the

[template repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-timer)and initializes the project in the current folder. The`-e`

flag sets a name for the current environment. In`azd`

, the environment maintains a unique deployment context for your app, and you can define more than one. The environment name is also used in the name of the resource group you create in Azure.Create a file named

*local.settings.json*in the`src`

folder that contains this JSON data:`{ "IsEncrypted": false, "Values": { "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true", "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python", "TIMER_SCHEDULE": "*/30 * * * * *" } }`

This file is required when running locally.


## Create and activate a virtual environment

In the root folder, run these commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python doesn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


## Run in your local environment

Run this command from your app folder in a terminal or command prompt:

`func start`


Run this command from your app folder in a terminal or command prompt:

`npm install npm start`


When the Functions host starts in your local project folder, it writes information about your Timer triggered function to the terminal output. You should see your Timer triggered function execute based on the schedule defined in your code.

The default schedule is

`*/30 * * * * *`

, which runs every 30 seconds.When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the

`func.exe`

host process.

- Run
`deactivate`

to shut down the virtual environment.

## Review the code (optional)

You can review the code that defines the Timer trigger function:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Timer;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace Company.Function
{
public class timerFunction
{
private readonly ILogger _logger;
public timerFunction(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
{
_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<timerFunction>();
}
[Function("timerFunction")]
public void Run(
[TimerTrigger("%TIMER_SCHEDULE%", RunOnStartup = true)] TimerInfo myTimer,
FunctionContext context
)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
if (myTimer.IsPastDue)
{
_logger.LogWarning("The timer is running late!");
}
}
}
}
```


You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-dotnet-azd-timer).

```
import { app, InvocationContext, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerFunction(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log(`TypeScript Timer trigger function executed at: ${new Date().toISOString()}`);
if (myTimer.isPastDue) {
context.warn("The timer is running late!");
}
}
app.timer('timerFunction', {
schedule: '%TIMER_SCHEDULE%',
runOnStartup: true,
handler: timerFunction
});
```


You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-timer).

```
import datetime
import logging
import azure.functions as func
# Create the function app instance
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.timer_trigger(schedule="%TIMER_SCHEDULE%",
arg_name="mytimer",
run_on_startup=True,
use_monitor=False)
def timer_function(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
utc_timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()
logging.info(f'Python timer trigger function executed at: {utc_timestamp}')
if mytimer.past_due:
logging.warning('The timer is running late!')
```


You can review the complete template project [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-python-azd-timer).

After you verify your function locally, it's time to publish it to Azure.

## Deploy to Azure

This project is configured to use the `azd up`

command to deploy your code to a new function app in a Flex Consumption plan in Azure.

Tip

This project includes a set of Bicep files that `azd`

uses to create a secure deployment to a Flex consumption plan that follows best practices.

Run this command to have

`azd`

create the required Azure resources in Azure and deploy your code project to the new function app:`azd up`

The root folder contains the

`azure.yaml`

definition file required by`azd`

.If you're not already signed in, you're asked to authenticate with your Azure account.

When prompted, provide these required deployment parameters:

Parameter Description *Azure subscription*Subscription in which your resources are created. *Azure location*Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown. The

`azd up`

command uses your response to these prompts with the Bicep configuration files to complete these deployment tasks:Create and configure these required Azure resources (equivalent to

`azd provision`

):- Flex Consumption plan and function app
- Azure Storage (required) and Application Insights (recommended)
- Access policies and roles for your account
- Service-to-service connections using managed identities (instead of stored connection strings)
- Virtual network to securely run both the function app and the other Azure resources

Package and deploy your code to the deployment container (equivalent to

`azd deploy`

). The app is then started and runs in the deployed package.

After the command completes successfully, you see links to the resources you created.


## Verify deployment

After deployment completes, your Timer trigger function automatically starts running in Azure based on its schedule.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your new function app.Select

**Log stream**from the left menu to monitor your function executions in real-time.You should see log entries that show your Timer trigger function executing according to its schedule.


## Redeploy your code

Run the `azd up`

command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

Note

Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

Your initial responses to `azd`

prompts and any environment variables generated by `azd`

are stored locally in your named environment. Use the `azd env get-values`

command to review all of the variables in your environment that were used when creating Azure resources.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```
azd down --no-prompt
```


Note

The `--no-prompt`

option instructs `azd`

to delete your resource group without a confirmation from you.

This command doesn't affect your local code project.

# Azure Event Grid output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use the Event Grid output binding to write events to a custom topic. You must have a valid [access key for the custom topic](../event-grid/security-authenticate-publishing-clients). The Event Grid output binding doesn't support shared access signature (SAS) tokens.

For information on setup and configuration details, see [How to work with Event Grid triggers and bindings in Azure Functions](event-grid-how-tos).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

Important

The Event Grid output binding is only available for Functions 2.x and higher.

## Example

The type of the output parameter used with an Event Grid output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the binding extension version, and the modality of the C# function. The C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

[In-process class library](functions-dotnet-class-library): compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.[Isolated worker process class library](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): compiled C# function that runs in a worker process isolated from the runtime.

The following example shows how the custom type is used in both the trigger and an Event Grid output binding:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace SampleApp
{
public static class EventGridFunction
{
[Function(nameof(EventGridFunction))]
[EventGridOutput(TopicEndpointUri = "MyEventGridTopicUriSetting", TopicKeySetting = "MyEventGridTopicKeySetting")]
public static MyEventType Run([EventGridTrigger] MyEventType input, FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger(nameof(EventGridFunction));
logger.LogInformation(input.Data?.ToString());
var outputEvent = new MyEventType()
{
Id = "unique-id",
Subject = "abc-subject",
Data = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
{ "myKey", "myValue" }
}
};
return outputEvent;
}
}
public class MyEventType
{
public string? Id { get; set; }
public string? Topic { get; set; }
public string? Subject { get; set; }
public string? EventType { get; set; }
public DateTime EventTime { get; set; }
public IDictionary<string, object>? Data { get; set; }
}
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that writes a message to an Event Grid custom topic. The function uses the binding's `setValue`

method to output a string.

```
public class Function {
@FunctionName("EventGridTriggerTest")
public void run(@EventGridTrigger(name = "event") String content,
@EventGridOutput(name = "outputEvent", topicEndpointUri = "MyEventGridTopicUriSetting", topicKeySetting = "MyEventGridTopicKeySetting") OutputBinding<String> outputEvent,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java EventGrid trigger processed a request." + content);
final String eventGridOutputDocument = "{\"id\": \"1807\", \"eventType\": \"recordInserted\", \"subject\": \"myapp/cars/java\", \"eventTime\":\"2017-08-10T21:03:07+00:00\", \"data\": {\"make\": \"Ducati\",\"model\": \"Monster\"}, \"dataVersion\": \"1.0\"}";
outputEvent.setValue(eventGridOutputDocument);
}
}
```


You can also use a POJO class to send Event Grid messages.

```
public class Function {
@FunctionName("EventGridTriggerTest")
public void run(@EventGridTrigger(name = "event") String content,
@EventGridOutput(name = "outputEvent", topicEndpointUri = "MyEventGridTopicUriSetting", topicKeySetting = "MyEventGridTopicKeySetting") OutputBinding<EventGridEvent> outputEvent,
final ExecutionContext context) {
context.getLogger().info("Java EventGrid trigger processed a request." + content);
final EventGridEvent eventGridOutputDocument = new EventGridEvent();
eventGridOutputDocument.setId("1807");
eventGridOutputDocument.setEventType("recordInserted");
eventGridOutputDocument.setEventTime("2017-08-10T21:03:07+00:00");
eventGridOutputDocument.setDataVersion("1.0");
eventGridOutputDocument.setSubject("myapp/cars/java");
eventGridOutputDocument.setData("{\"make\": \"Ducati\",\"model\":\"monster\"");
outputEvent.setValue(eventGridOutputDocument);
}
}
class EventGridEvent {
private String id;
private String eventType;
private String subject;
private String eventTime;
private String dataVersion;
private String data;
public String getId() {
return id;
}
public String getData() {
return data;
}
public void setData(String data) {
this.data = data;
}
public String getDataVersion() {
return dataVersion;
}
public void setDataVersion(String dataVersion) {
this.dataVersion = dataVersion;
}
public String getEventTime() {
return eventTime;
}
public void setEventTime(String eventTime) {
this.eventTime = eventTime;
}
public String getSubject() {
return subject;
}
public void setSubject(String subject) {
this.subject = subject;
}
public String getEventType() {
return eventType;
}
public void setEventType(String eventType) {
this.eventType = eventType;
}
public void setId(String id) {
this.id = id;
}
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that outputs a single event:

```
import { app, EventGridPartialEvent, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<EventGridPartialEvent> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return {
id: 'message-id',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Henry',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
};
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.eventGrid({
topicEndpointUri: 'MyEventGridTopicUriSetting',
topicKeySetting: 'MyEventGridTopicKeySetting',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple events, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return [
{
id: 'message-id',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Henry',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
},
{
id: 'message-id-2',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Doe',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
},
];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that outputs a single event:

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const eventGridOutput = output.eventGrid({
topicEndpointUri: 'MyEventGridTopicUriSetting',
topicKeySetting: 'MyEventGridTopicKeySetting',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: eventGridOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return {
id: 'message-id',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Henry',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
};
},
});
```


To output multiple events, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return [
{
id: 'message-id',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Henry',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
},
{
id: 'message-id-2',
subject: 'subject-name',
dataVersion: '1.0',
eventType: 'event-type',
data: {
name: 'John Doe',
},
eventTime: timeStamp,
},
];
```


The following example demonstrates how to configure a function to output an Event Grid event message. The section where `type`

is set to `eventGrid`

configures the values needed to establish an Event Grid output binding.

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "eventGrid",
"name": "outputEvent",
"topicEndpointUri": "MyEventGridTopicUriSetting",
"topicKeySetting": "MyEventGridTopicKeySetting",
"direction": "out"
},
{
"authLevel": "anonymous",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "Request",
"methods": [
"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "Response"
}
]
}
```


In your function, use the `Push-OutputBinding`

to send an event to a custom topic through the Event Grid output binding.

```
using namespace System.Net
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)
# Write to the Azure Functions log stream.
Write-Host "PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request."
# Interact with query parameters or the body of the request.
$message = $Request.Query.Message
Push-OutputBinding -Name outputEvent -Value @{
id = "1"
eventType = "testEvent"
subject = "testapp/testPublish"
eventTime = "2020-08-27T21:03:07+00:00"
data = @{
Message = $message
}
dataVersion = "1.0"
}
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = 200
Body = "OK"
})
```


The following example shows a trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. It then sends in an event to the custom topic, as specified by the `topicEndpointUri`

. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

Here's the function in the function_app.py file:

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import datetime
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="eventgrid_output")
@app.event_grid_trigger(arg_name="eventGridEvent")
@app.event_grid_output(
arg_name="outputEvent",
topic_endpoint_uri="MyEventGridTopicUriSetting",
topic_key_setting="MyEventGridTopicKeySetting")
def eventgrid_output(eventGridEvent: func.EventGridEvent,
outputEvent: func.Out[func.EventGridOutputEvent]) -> None:
logging.log("eventGridEvent: ", eventGridEvent)
outputEvent.set(
func.EventGridOutputEvent(
id="test-id",
data={"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "value2"},
subject="test-subject",
event_type="test-event-1",
event_time=datetime.datetime.utcnow(),
data_version="1.0"))
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to configure the binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#event-grid-output).

The attribute's constructor takes the name of an application setting that contains the name of the custom topic, and the name of an application setting that contains the topic key.

The following table explains the parameters for the `EventGridOutputAttribute`

.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
TopicEndpointUri |
The name of an app setting that contains the URI for the custom topic, such as `MyTopicEndpointUri` . |
TopicKeySetting |
The name of an app setting that contains an access key for the custom topic. |
connection* |
The value of the common prefix for the setting that contains the topic endpoint URI. For more information about the naming format of this application setting, see
|

## Annotations

For Java classes, use the [EventGridAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-library/blob/dev/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/annotation/EventGridOutput.java) attribute.

The attribute's constructor takes the name of an app setting that contains the name of the custom topic, and the name of an app setting that contains the topic key. For more information about these settings, see [Output - configuration](#configuration). Here's an `EventGridOutput`

attribute example:

```
public class Function {
@FunctionName("EventGridTriggerTest")
public void run(@EventGridTrigger(name = "event") String content,
@EventGridOutput(name = "outputEvent", topicEndpointUri = "MyEventGridTopicUriSetting", topicKeySetting = "MyEventGridTopicKeySetting") OutputBinding<String> outputEvent, final ExecutionContext context) {
...
}
}
```


## Configuration

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.eventGrid()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
topicEndpointUri |
The name of an app setting that contains the URI for the custom topic, such as `MyTopicEndpointUri` . |
topicKeySetting |
The name of an app setting that contains an access key for the custom topic. |
connection* |
The value of the common prefix for the setting that contains the topic endpoint URI. When setting the `connection` property, the `topicEndpointUri` and `topicKeySetting` properties shouldn't be set. For more information about the naming format of this application setting, see
|

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `eventGrid` . |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This parameter is set automatically when you create the binding in the Azure portal. |
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the event. |
topicEndpointUri |
The name of an app setting that contains the URI for the custom topic, such as `MyTopicEndpointUri` . |
topicKeySetting |
The name of an app setting that contains an access key for the custom topic. |
connection* |
The value of the common prefix for the setting that contains the topic endpoint URI. For more information about the naming format of this application setting, see
|

*Support for identity-based connections requires version 3.3.x or higher of the extension.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

Important

Make sure that you set the value of `TopicEndpointUri`

to the name of an app setting that contains the URI of the custom topic. Don't specify the URI of the custom topic directly in this property. The same applies when using `Connection`

.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

The parameter type supported by the Event Grid output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Grid output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing a JSON event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Grid output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventGridPublisherClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid.eventgridpublisherclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventGrid](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventgrid) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

Send individual messages by calling a method parameter such as `out EventGridOutput paramName`

, and write multiple messages with `ICollector<EventGridOutput>`

.

Access the output event by using the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet to send an event to the Event Grid output binding.

There are two options for outputting an Event Grid message from a function:

**Return value**: Set the`name`

property in*function.json*to`$return`

. With this configuration, the function's return value is persisted as an Event Grid message.**Imperative**: Pass a value to the[set](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out#set-val--t-----none)method of the parameter declared as an[Out](/en-us/python/api/azure-functions/azure.functions.out)type. The value passed to`set`

is persisted as an Event Grid message.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[str]`

, `func.Out[bytes]`

, `func.Out[func.EventGridOutputEvent]`

, or `func.Out[List[func.EventGridOutputEvent]]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.

## Connections

There are two ways of authenticating to an Event Grid topic when using the Event Grid output binding:

| Authentication method | Description |
|---|---|
| Using a topic key | Set the `TopicEndpointUri` and `TopicKeySetting` properties, as described in
|
| Using an identity | Set the `Connection` property to the name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining
|

### Use a topic key

Use the following steps to configure a topic key:

Follow the steps in

[Get access keys](../event-grid/get-access-keys)to obtain the topic key for your Event Grid topic.In your application settings, create a setting that defines the topic key value. Use the name of this setting for the

`TopicKeySetting`

property of the binding.In your application settings, create a setting that defines the topic endpoint. Use the name of this setting for the

`TopicEndpointUri`

property of the binding.

### Identity-based authentication

When using version 3.3.x or higher of the extension, you can connect to an Event Grid topic using an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to avoid having to obtain and work with topic keys.

You need to create an application setting that returns the topic endpoint URI. The name of the setting should combine a *unique common prefix* (for example, `myawesometopic`

) with the value `__topicEndpointUri`

. Then, you must use that common prefix (in this case, `myawesometopic`

) when you define the `Connection`

property in the binding.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topic Endpoint URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__topicEndpointUri` |
The topic endpoint. | `https://<topic-name>.centralus-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events` |

More properties can be used to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for managed identity-based connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:topicEndpointUri`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You must create a role assignment that provides access to your Event Grid topic at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Event Hubs extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

# Azure Functions monitoring data reference

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article contains all the monitoring reference information for this service.

See [Monitor Azure Functions](monitor-functions) for details on the data you can collect for Azure Functions and how to use it.

See [Monitor executions in Azure Functions](functions-monitoring) for details on using Application Insights to collect and analyze log data from individual functions in your function app.

## Metrics

This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics for this service. These metrics are also part of the global list of [all platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type).

For information on metric retention, see [Azure Monitor Metrics overview](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#retention-of-metrics).

Hosting plans that allow your apps to scale dynamically support extra Functions-specific metrics:

These metrics are used to estimate the costs associated with *on demand* and *always ready* meters used for billing in a [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan):

| Metric | Description | Meter calculation |
|---|---|---|
On Demand Function Execution Count |
Total number of function executions in on demand instances. | `OnDemandFunctionExecutionCount` relates to the On Demand Total Executions meter. |
Always Ready Function Execution Count |
Total number of function executions in always ready instances. | `AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionCount` relates to the Always Ready Total Executions meter. |
On Demand Function Execution Units |
Total MB-milliseconds from on demand instances while actively executing functions. | `OnDemandFunctionExecutionUnits / 1,024,000` is the On Demand Execution Time meter, in GB-seconds. |
Always Ready Function Execution Units |
Total MB-milliseconds from always ready instances while actively executing functions. | `AlwaysReadyFunctionExecutionUnits / 1,024,000` is the Always Ready Execution Time meter, in GB-seconds. |
Always Ready Units |
The total MB-milliseconds of always ready instances assigned to the app, whether or not functions are actively executing. | `AlwaysReadyUnits / 1,024,000` is the Always Ready Baseline meter, in GB-seconds. |

In this table, all execution units are calculated by multiplying the fixed instance memory size, such as 512 MB or 2,048 MB, by total execution times, in milliseconds.

These metrics are used to monitor the performance and scaling behavior of your function app in a Flex Consumption plan:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
Automatic Scaling Instance Count |
The number of instances on which this app is running. Note that this is emitted every 30 seconds, and given Flex Consumption scales out and in fast, the number will be an aggregate of all new instances the app used in this time period. Make sure to change the aggregation to the minimum possible in the graph and the aggregation to "count". |
Memory working set |
The current amount of memory used by the app, in MB. Can be further filtered for each instance of the app. |
Average memory working set |
The average amount of memory used by the app, in megabytes (MB). Can be further filtered for each instance of the app. |
CPU Percentage |
The average percentage of CPU being used. Can be further filtered for each instance of the app. This is currently rolling out and might not be available for apps in all regions yet. |

These performance metrics help you understand resource utilization and scaling patterns in your Flex Consumption function app. The instance count metric is particularly useful for monitoring the dynamic scaling behavior, while memory and CPU metrics provide insights into resource consumption patterns.

### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Web/sites

The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.Web/sites resource type. Most of these metrics apply to both function app and web apps, which both run on App Service.

Note

These metrics aren't available when your function app runs on Linux in a [Consumption plan](consumption-plan).

# Timer trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with timer triggers in Azure Functions. A timer trigger lets you run a function on a schedule.

This is reference information for Azure Functions developers. If you're new to Azure Functions, start with the following resources:

C# developer references:


For information on how to manually run a timer-triggered function, see [Manually run a non HTTP-triggered function](functions-manually-run-non-http).

Support for this binding is automatically provided in all development environments. You don't have to manually install the package or register the extension.

Source code for the timer extension package is in the [azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions/Extensions/Timers/) GitHub repository.

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

This example shows a C# function that executes each time the minutes have a value divisible by five. For example, when the function starts at 18:55:00, the next execution is at 19:00:00. A `TimerInfo`

object is passed to the function.

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

```
[Function(nameof(TimerFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")] TimerInfo timerInfo,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger(nameof(TimerFunction));
logger.LogInformation($"Function Ran. Next timer schedule = {timerInfo.ScheduleStatus?.Next}");
}
```


The following example function triggers and executes every five minutes. The `@TimerTrigger`

annotation on the function defines the schedule using the same string format as [CRON expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).

```
@FunctionName("keepAlive")
public void keepAlive(
@TimerTrigger(name = "keepAliveTrigger", schedule = "0 */5 * * * *") String timerInfo,
ExecutionContext context
) {
// timeInfo is a JSON string, you can deserialize it to an object using your favorite JSON library
context.getLogger().info("Timer is triggered: " + timerInfo);
}
```


The following example shows a timer trigger binding and function code that uses the binding, where an instance representing the timer is passed to the function. The function writes a log indicating whether this function invocation is due to a missed schedule occurrence. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import datetime
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="mytimer")
@app.timer_trigger(schedule="0 */5 * * * *",
arg_name="mytimer",
run_on_startup=False)
def test_function(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
utc_timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().replace(
tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()
if mytimer.past_due:
logging.info('The timer is past due!')
logging.info('Python timer trigger function ran at %s', utc_timestamp)
```


The following example shows a timer trigger [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript).

```
import { app, InvocationContext, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log('Timer function processed request.');
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


The following example shows a timer trigger [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node).

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"schedule": "0 */5 * * * *",
"name": "myTimer",
"type": "timerTrigger",
"direction": "in"
}
```


The following is the timer function code in the run.ps1 file:

```
# Input bindings are passed in via param block.
param($myTimer)
# Get the current universal time in the default string format.
$currentUTCtime = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()
# The 'IsPastDue' property is 'true' when the current function invocation is later than scheduled.
if ($myTimer.IsPastDue) {
Write-Host "PowerShell timer is running late!"
}
# Write an information log with the current time.
Write-Host "PowerShell timer trigger function ran! TIME: $currentUTCtime"
```


## Attributes

[In-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) C# library uses [TimerTriggerAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-extensions/blob/master/src/WebJobs.Extensions/Extensions/Timers/TimerTriggerAttribute.cs) from [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions) whereas [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# library uses [TimerTriggerAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.Timer/src/TimerTriggerAttribute.cs) from [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Timer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Timer) to define the function. C# script instead uses a [function.json configuration file](#configuration).

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
Schedule |
A
`TimeSpan` can be used only for a function app that runs on an App Service Plan. You can put the schedule expression in an app setting and set this property to the app setting name wrapped in % signs, as `%ScheduleAppSetting%` . |

**RunOnStartup**`true`

, the function is invoked when the runtime starts. For example, the runtime starts when the function app wakes up after going idle due to inactivity. when the function app restarts due to function changes, and when the function app scales out. *Use with caution.***RunOnStartup**should rarely if ever be set to`true`

, especially in production.**UseMonitor**`true`

or `false`

to indicate whether the schedule should be monitored. Schedule monitoring persists schedule occurrences to aid in ensuring the schedule is maintained correctly even when function app instances restart. If not set explicitly, the default is `true`

for schedules that have a recurrence interval greater than or equal to 1 minute. For schedules that trigger more than once per minute, the default is `false`

.## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `schedule`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the timer object in function code. |
`schedule` |
A
`TimeSpan` can be used only for a function app that runs on an App Service Plan. You can put the schedule expression in an app setting and set this property to the app setting name wrapped in % signs, as in this example: "%ScheduleAppSetting%". |

`run_on_startup`

`true`

, the function is invoked when the runtime starts. For example, the runtime starts when the function app wakes up after going idle due to inactivity. when the function app restarts due to function changes, and when the function app scales out. *Use with caution.***runOnStartup**should rarely if ever be set to`true`

, especially in production.`use_monitor`

`true`

or `false`

to indicate whether the schedule should be monitored. Schedule monitoring persists schedule occurrences to aid in ensuring the schedule is maintained correctly even when function app instances restart. If not set explicitly, the default is `true`

for schedules that have a recurrence interval greater than or equal to 1 minute. For schedules that trigger more than once per minute, the default is `false`

.For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The `@TimerTrigger`

annotation on the function defines the `schedule`

using the same string format as [CRON expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression). The annotation supports the following settings:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `app.timer()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
schedule |
A
`TimeSpan` can be used only for a function app that runs on an App Service Plan. You can put the schedule expression in an app setting and set this property to the app setting name wrapped in % signs, as in this example: "%ScheduleAppSetting%". |

**runOnStartup**`true`

, the function is invoked when the runtime starts. For example, the runtime starts when the function app wakes up after going idle due to inactivity. when the function app restarts due to function changes, and when the function app scales out. *Use with caution.***runOnStartup**should rarely if ever be set to`true`

, especially in production.**useMonitor**`true`

or `false`

to indicate whether the schedule should be monitored. Schedule monitoring persists schedule occurrences to aid in ensuring the schedule is maintained correctly even when function app instances restart. If not set explicitly, the default is `true`

for schedules that have a recurrence interval greater than or equal to 1 minute. For schedules that trigger more than once per minute, the default is `false`

.The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to "timerTrigger". This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to "in". This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the timer object in function code. |
schedule |
A
`TimeSpan` can be used only for a function app that runs on an App Service Plan. You can put the schedule expression in an app setting and set this property to the app setting name wrapped in % signs, as in this example: "%ScheduleAppSetting%". |

**runOnStartup**`true`

, the function is invoked when the runtime starts. For example, the runtime starts when the function app wakes up after going idle due to inactivity. when the function app restarts due to function changes, and when the function app scales out. *Use with caution.***runOnStartup**should rarely if ever be set to`true`

, especially in production.**useMonitor**`true`

or `false`

to indicate whether the schedule should be monitored. Schedule monitoring persists schedule occurrences to aid in ensuring the schedule is maintained correctly even when function app instances restart. If not set explicitly, the default is `true`

for schedules that have a recurrence interval greater than or equal to 1 minute. For schedules that trigger more than once per minute, the default is `false`

.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

Caution

Don't set **runOnStartup** to `true`

in production. Using this setting makes code execute at highly unpredictable times. In certain production settings, these extra executions can result in significantly higher costs for apps hosted in a Consumption plan. For example, with **runOnStartup** enabled the trigger is invoked whenever your function app is scaled. Make sure you fully understand the production behavior of your functions before enabling **runOnStartup** in production.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

When a timer trigger function is invoked, a timer object is passed into the function. The following JSON is an example representation of the timer object.

```
{
"Schedule":{
"AdjustForDST": true
},
"ScheduleStatus": {
"Last":"2016-10-04T10:15:00+00:00",
"LastUpdated":"2016-10-04T10:16:00+00:00",
"Next":"2016-10-04T10:20:00+00:00"
},
"IsPastDue":false
}
```


```
{
"schedule":{
"adjustForDST": true
},
"scheduleStatus": {
"last":"2016-10-04T10:15:00+00:00",
"lastUpdated":"2016-10-04T10:16:00+00:00",
"next":"2016-10-04T10:20:00+00:00"
},
"isPastDue":false
}
```


The `isPastDue`

property is `true`

when the current function invocation is later than scheduled. For example, a function app restart might cause an invocation to be missed.

### NCRONTAB expressions

Azure Functions uses the [NCronTab](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab) library to interpret NCRONTAB expressions. An NCRONTAB expression is similar to a CRON expression except that it includes an additional sixth field at the beginning to use for time precision in seconds:

`{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}`


Each field can have one of the following types of values:

| Type | Example | When triggered |
|---|---|---|
| A specific value | `0 5 * * * *` |
Once every hour of the day at minute 5 of each hour |
All values (`*` ) |
`0 * 5 * * *` |
At every minute in the hour, during hour 5 |
A range (`-` operator) |
`5-7 * * * * *` |
Three times a minute - at seconds 5 through 7 during every minute of every hour of each day |
A set of values (`,` operator) |
`5,8,10 * * * * *` |
Three times a minute - at seconds 5, 8, and 10 during every minute of every hour of each day |
An interval value (`/` operator) |
`0 */5 * * * *` |
12 times an hour - at second 0 of every 5th minute of every hour of each day |

To specify months or days you can use numeric values, names, or abbreviations of names:

- For days, the numeric values are 0 to 6, where 0 starts with Sunday.
- Names are in English. For example:
`Monday`

,`January`

. - Names are case-insensitive.
- Names can be abbreviated. We recommend using three letters for abbreviations. For example:
`Mon`

,`Jan`

.

#### NCRONTAB examples

Here are some examples of NCRONTAB expressions you can use for the timer trigger in Azure Functions.

| Example | When triggered |
|---|---|
`0 */5 * * * *` |
once every five minutes |
`0 0 * * * *` |
once at the top of every hour |
`0 0 */2 * * *` |
once every two hours |
`0 0 9-17 * * *` |
once every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM |
`0 30 9 * * *` |
at 9:30 AM every day |
`0 30 9 * * 1-5` |
at 9:30 AM every weekday |
`0 30 9 * Jan Mon` |
at 9:30 AM every Monday in January |

Note

NCRONTAB expression supports both **five field** and **six field** format. The sixth field position is a value for seconds which is placed at the beginning of the expression.
If the CRON expression is invalid the Azure Portal Function Test will display a 404 error, if Application Insights is connected more details are logged there.

#### NCRONTAB time zones

The numbers in an NCRONTAB expression refer to a time and date, not a time span. For example, a 5 in the `hour`

field refers to 5:00 AM, not every 5 hours.

The default time zone used with the CRON expressions is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To have your CRON expression based on another time zone, create an app setting for your function app named `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`

.

The value of this setting depends on the operating system and plan on which your function app runs.

| Operating system | Plan | Value |
|---|---|---|
Windows |
All | Set the value to the name of the desired time zone as given by the second line from each pair given by the Windows command `tzutil.exe /L` |
Linux |
Premium Dedicated |
Set the value to the name of the desired time zone as shown in the
|

Note

`WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`

and `TZ`

aren't currently supported when running on Linux in a [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) or [Consumption](consumption-plan) plan. In this case, the setting `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`

or `TZ`

can create SSL-related issues and cause metrics to stop working for your app.

For example, Eastern Time in the US (represented by `Eastern Standard Time`

(Windows) or `America/New_York`

(Linux)) currently uses UTC-05:00 during standard time and UTC-04:00 during daylight time. To have a timer trigger fire at 10:00 AM Eastern Time every day, create an app setting for your function app named `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`

, set the value to `Eastern Standard Time`

(Windows) or `America/New_York`

(Linux), and then use the following NCRONTAB expression:

```
"0 0 10 * * *"
```


When you use `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE`

, the time is adjusted for time changes in the specific timezone, including daylight saving time and changes in standard time.

### TimeSpan

A `TimeSpan`

can be used only for a function app that runs on an App Service Plan.

Unlike an NCRONTAB expression, a `TimeSpan`

value specifies the time interval between each function invocation. When a function completes after running longer than the specified interval, the timer immediately invokes the function again.

Expressed as a string, the `TimeSpan`

format is `hh:mm:ss`

when `hh`

is less than 24. When the first two digits are 24 or greater, the format is `dd:hh:mm`

. Here are some examples:

| Example | When triggered |
|---|---|
| "01:00:00" | every hour |
| "00:01:00" | every minute |
| "25:00:00:00" | every 25 days |
| "1.00:00:00" | every day |

### Scale-out

If a function app scales out to multiple instances, only a single instance of a timer-triggered function is run across all instances. It will not trigger again if there is an outstanding invocation still running.

### Function apps sharing Storage

If you are sharing storage accounts across function apps that are not deployed to app service, you might need to explicitly assign host ID to each app.

| Functions version | Setting |
|---|---|
| 2.x (and higher) | `AzureFunctionsWebHost__hostid` environment variable |
| 1.x | `id` in host.json |

You can omit the identifying value or manually set each function app's identifying configuration to a different value.

The timer trigger uses a storage lock to ensure that there is only one timer instance when a function app scales out to multiple instances. If two function apps share the same identifying configuration and each uses a timer trigger, only one timer runs.

### Retry behavior

Unlike the queue trigger, the timer trigger doesn't retry after a function fails. When a function fails, it isn't called again until the next time on the schedule.

### Manually invoke a timer trigger

The timer trigger for Azure Functions provides an HTTP webhook that can be invoked to manually trigger the function. This can be extremely useful in the following scenarios.

- Integration testing
- Slot swaps as part of a smoke test or warmup activity
- Initial deployment of a function to immediately populate a cache or lookup table in a database

Please refer to [manually run a non HTTP-triggered function](functions-manually-run-non-http) for details on how to manually invoke a timer triggered function.

### Troubleshooting

For information about what to do when the timer trigger doesn't work as expected, see [Investigating and reporting issues with timer triggered functions not firing](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Investigating-and-reporting-issues-with-timer-triggered-functions-not-firing).

## Connections

Timer triggers have an implicit dependency on blob storage, except when run locally through the Azure Functions Core Tools. The system uses blob storage to coordinate across multiple instances [when the app scales out](#scale-out). It accesses blob storage using the host storage (`AzureWebJobsStorage`

) connection. If you configure the host storage to use an [identity-based connection](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity), the identity should have the [Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) role, which is the default requirement for host storage.

# Migrate to version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article discusses the differences between version 3 and version 4 of the Node.js programming model and how to upgrade an existing v3 app. If you want to create a new v4 app instead of upgrading an existing v3 app, see the tutorial for either [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](how-to-create-function-azure-cli?pivots=programming-language-javascript) or [Azure Functions Core Tools](how-to-create-function-vs-code?pivot=programming-language-javascript). This article uses "tip" alerts to highlight the most important concrete actions that you should take to upgrade your app.
Version 4 is designed to provide Node.js developers with the following benefits:

- Provide a familiar and intuitive experience to Node.js developers.
- Make the file structure flexible with support for full customization.
- Switch to a code-centric approach for defining function configuration.

## Considerations

- The Node.js programming model shouldn't be confused with the Azure Functions runtime:
**Programming model**: Defines how you author your code and is specific to JavaScript and TypeScript.**Runtime**: Defines underlying behavior of Azure Functions and is shared across all languages.

- The version of the programming model is strictly tied to the version of the
npm package. It's versioned independently of the`@azure/functions`

[runtime](functions-versions). Both the runtime and the programming model use the number 4 as their latest major version, but that's a coincidence. - You can't mix the v3 and v4 programming models in the same function app. As soon as you register one v4 function in your app, any v3 functions registered in
*function.json*files are ignored.

## Requirements

Version 4 of the Node.js programming model requires the following minimum versions:

npm package v4.0.0`@azure/functions`

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)v18+[Azure Functions Runtime](functions-versions)v4.25+[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)v4.0.5382+ (if running locally)

npm package v4.0.0`@azure/functions`

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)v18+[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)v4+[Azure Functions Runtime](functions-versions)v4.25+[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)v4.0.5382+ (if running locally)

## Include the npm package

In v4, the [ @azure/functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/functions) npm package contains the primary source code that backs the Node.js programming model. In previous versions, that code shipped directly in Azure and the npm package had only the TypeScript types. You now need to include this package for both TypeScript and JavaScript apps. You

*can*include the package for existing v3 apps, but it isn't required.

Tip

Make sure the `@azure/functions`

package is listed in the `dependencies`

section (not `devDependencies`

) of your *package.json* file. You can install v4 by using the following command:

```
npm install @azure/functions
```


## Set your app entry point

In v4 of the programming model, you can structure your code however you want. The only files that you need at the root of your app are *host.json* and *package.json*.

Otherwise, you define the file structure by setting the `main`

field in your *package.json* file. You can set the `main`

field to a single file or multiple files by using a [glob pattern](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). The following table shows example values for the `main`

field:

| Example | Description |

A combination where you register each function from its own file, but you still have a root file for general app-level code. |

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
`dist/src/index.js` |
Register functions from a single root file. |
`dist/src/functions/*.js` |
Register each function from its own file. |
`dist/src/{index.js,functions/*.js}` |
A combination where you register each function from its own file, but you still have a root file for general app-level code. |

Tip

Make sure you define a `main`

field in your *package.json* file.

## Switch the order of arguments

The trigger input, instead of the invocation context, is now the first argument to your function handler. The invocation context, now the second argument, is simplified in v4 and isn't as required as the trigger input. You can leave it off if you aren't using it.

Tip

Switch the order of your arguments. For example, if you're using an HTTP trigger, switch `(context, request)`

to either `(request, context)`

or just `(request)`

if you aren't using the context.

## Define your function in code

You no longer have to create and maintain those separate *function.json* configuration files. You can now fully define your functions directly in your TypeScript or JavaScript files. In addition, many properties now have defaults so that you don't have to specify them every time.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
},
});
```


```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text()) || 'world';
return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


Tip

Move the configuration from your *function.json* file to your code. The type of the trigger corresponds to a method on the `app`

object in the new model. For example, if you use an `httpTrigger`

type in *function.json*, call `app.http()`

in your code to register the function. If you use `timerTrigger`

, call `app.timer()`

.

## Review your usage of context

In v4, the `context`

object is simplified to reduce duplication and to make writing unit tests easier. For example, we streamlined the primary input and output so that they're accessed only as the argument and return value of your function handler.

You can't access the primary input and output on the `context`

object anymore, but you must still access *secondary* inputs and outputs on the `context`

object. For more information about secondary inputs and outputs, see the [Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node#extra-inputs-and-outputs).

### Get the primary input as an argument

The primary input is also called the *trigger* and is the only required input or output. You must have one (and only one) trigger.

Version 4 supports only one way of getting the trigger input, as the first argument:

```
async function httpTrigger1(request, context) {
const onlyOption = request;
```


```
async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const onlyOption = request;
```


Tip

Make sure you aren't using `context.req`

or `context.bindings`

to get the input.

### Set the primary output as your return value

Version 4 supports only one way of setting the primary output, through the return value:

```
return {
body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
```


```
async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
// ...
return {
body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
}
```


Tip

Make sure you always return the output in your function handler, instead of setting it with the `context`

object.

### Context logging

In v4, logging methods were moved to the root `context`

object as shown in the following example. For more information about logging, see the [Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node#logging).

```
context.log('This is an info log');
context.error('This is an error');
context.warn('This is an error');
```


### Create a test context

Version 3 doesn't support creating an invocation context outside the Azure Functions runtime, so authoring unit tests can be difficult. Version 4 allows you to create an instance of the invocation context, although the information during tests isn't detailed unless you add it yourself.

```
const testInvocationContext = new InvocationContext({
functionName: 'testFunctionName',
invocationId: 'testInvocationId'
});
```


## Review your usage of HTTP types

The HTTP request and response types are now a subset of the [fetch standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch). They're no longer unique to Azure Functions.

The types use the [ undici](https://undici.nodejs.org/) package in Node.js. This package follows the fetch standard and is

[currently being integrated](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1737)into Node.js core.

### HttpRequest

*Body*. You can access the body by using a method specific to the type that you want to receive:`const body = await request.text(); const body = await request.json(); const body = await request.formData(); const body = await request.arrayBuffer(); const body = await request.blob();`

*Header*:`const header = request.headers.get('content-type');`

*Query parameter*:`const name = request.query.get('name');`


### HttpResponse

*Status*:`return { status: 200 };`

*Body*:Use the

`body`

property to return most types like a`string`

or`Buffer`

:`return { body: "Hello, world!" };`

Use the

`jsonBody`

property for the easiest way to return a JSON response:`return { jsonBody: { hello: "world" } };`

*Header*. You can set the header in two ways, depending on whether you're using the`HttpResponse`

class or the`HttpResponseInit`

interface:`const response = new HttpResponse(); response.headers.set('content-type', 'application/json'); return response;`

`return { headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' } };`


Tip

Update any logic by using the HTTP request or response types to match the new methods.

Tip

Update any logic by using the HTTP request or response types to match the new methods. You should get TypeScript build errors to help you identify if you're using old methods.

# Tutorial: Create a function to integrate with Azure Logic Apps

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with Azure Logic Apps in the Logic Apps Designer. This integration allows you use the computing power of Functions in orchestrations with other Azure and third-party services.

This tutorial shows you how to create a workflow to analyze X activity. As tweets are evaluated, the workflow sends notifications when positive sentiments are detected.

In this tutorial, you learn to:

- Create an Azure AI services API Resource.
- Create a function that categorizes tweet sentiment.
- Create a logic app that connects to X.
- Add sentiment detection to the logic app.
- Connect the logic app to the function.
- Send an email based on the response from the function.

## Prerequisites

- An active
[X](https://x.com/)account. - An
[Outlook.com](https://outlook.com/)account (for sending notifications).

Note

If you want to use the Gmail connector, only G-Suite business accounts can use this connector without restrictions in logic apps. If you have a Gmail consumer account, you can use the Gmail connector with only specific Google-approved apps and services, or you can [create a Google client app to use for authentication in your Gmail connector](/en-us/connectors/gmail/#authentication-and-bring-your-own-application).

For more information, see [Data security and privacy policies for Google connectors in Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/connectors-google-data-security-privacy-policy).

# Overview of Azure functions for Azure Redis

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use either Azure Managed Redis or Azure Cache for Redis with Azure Functions to create optimized serverless and event-driven architectures.

Azure Functions provides an event-driven programming model where triggers and bindings are key features. With Azure Functions, you can easily build event-driven serverless applications. Azure Redis services (Azure Managed Redis and Azure Cache for Redis) provide a set of building blocks and best practices for building distributed applications, including microservices, state management, pub/sub messaging, and more.

Azure Redis can be used as a trigger for Azure Functions, allowing you to initiate a serverless workflow. This functionality can be highly useful in data architectures like a write-behind cache, or any event-based architectures.

You can integrate Azure Redis and Azure Functions to build functions that react to events from Azure Redis or external systems.

| Action | Direction |
|---|---|
|

[Trigger on Redis lists](functions-bindings-cache-trigger-redislist)[Trigger on Redis streams](functions-bindings-cache-trigger-redisstream)[Read a cached value](functions-bindings-cache-input)[Write a values to cache](functions-bindings-cache-output)## Scope of availability for functions triggers and bindings

| Tier | Azure Cache for Redis (Basic, Standard, Premium, Enterprise, Enterprise Flash) | Azure Managed Redis (Memory Optimized, Basic, Compute Optimized, Flash Optimized) |
|---|---|---|
| Pub/Sub | Yes | Yes |
| Lists | Yes | Yes |
| Streams | Yes | Yes |
| Bindings | Yes | Yes |

Important

Redis triggers are currently only supported for functions running in either a [Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) or a dedicated [App Service plan](dedicated-plan).

## Install extension

Functions run in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project by installing [this NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Redis).

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Redis
```


## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Update packages

Add the [Azure Functions Java Redis Annotations package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.azure.functions/azure-functions-java-library-redis) to your project by updating the `pom.xml`

file to add this dependency:

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.microsoft.azure.functions</groupId>
<artifactId>azure-functions-java-library-redis</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```


## Redis connection string

Azure Redis triggers and bindings have a required property that indicates the application setting or collection name that contains cache connection information. The Redis trigger or binding looks for an environmental variable holding the connection string with the name passed to the `Connection`

parameter.

In local development, the `Connection`

can be defined using the [local.settings.json](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) file. When deployed to Azure, [application settings](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) can be used.

When connecting to a cache instance with an Azure function, you can use one of these kinds of connections in your deployments:

A user-assigned managed identity must be associated with your function app, and that identity must also be granted explicit permissions in your cache service. For more information, see [Use Microsoft Entra ID for cache authentication](/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-azure-active-directory-for-authentication).

These examples show the key name and value of app settings required to connect to each cache service based on the kind of client authentication, assuming that the `Connection`

property in the binding is set to `Redis`

.

```
"Redis__redisHostName": "<cacheName>.<region>.redis.azure.net",
"Redis__principalId": "<principalId>",
"Redis__clientId": "<clientId>"
```

# How to disable functions in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to disable a function in Azure Functions. To *disable* a function means to make the runtime ignore the event intended to trigger the function. This ability lets you prevent a specific function from running without having to modify and republish the entire function app.

You can disable a function in place by creating an app setting in the format `AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled`

set to `true`

. You can create and modify this application setting in several ways, including by using the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/), [Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/), and from your function's **Overview** tab in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Note

Changing application settings causes your function app to restart by default across all hosting plans. For zero-downtime deployments when changing settings, use the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) with [rolling updates as the site update strategy](flex-consumption-site-updates). For other hosting plans, see [optimize deployments](functions-best-practices#optimize-deployments) for guidance on minimizing downtime.

## Disable a function

Use one of these modes to create an app setting that disables an example function named `QueueTrigger`

:

Use the **Enable** and **Disable** buttons on the function's **Overview** page. These buttons work by changing the value of the `AzureWebJobs.QueueTrigger.Disabled`

app setting. The function-specific app setting is created the first time a function is disabled.

Even when you publish to your function app from a local project, you can still use the portal to disable functions in the function app.

Note

Disabled functions can still be run by calling the REST endpoint using a master key. To learn more, see [Run a disabled function](#run-a-disabled-function). This means that a disabled function still runs when started from the **Test/Run** window in the portal using the **master (Host key)**.

## Disable functions in a slot

By default, app settings also apply to apps running in deployment slots. You can, however, override the app setting used by the slot by setting a slot-specific app setting. For example, you might want a function to be active in production but not during deployment testing. It's common to disable timer triggered functions in slots to prevent simultaneous executions.

To disable a function only in the staging slot:

Navigate to the slot instance of your function app by selecting **Deployment slots** under **Deployment**, choosing your slot, and selecting **Functions** in the slot instance. Choose your function, then use the **Enable** and **Disable** buttons on the function's **Overview** page. These buttons work by changing the value of the `AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled`

app setting. This function-specific setting is created the first time you disable the function.

You can also directly add the app setting named `AzureWebJobs.<FUNCTION_NAME>.Disabled`

with value of `true`

in the **Configuration** for the slot instance. When you add a slot-specific app setting, make sure to check the **Deployment slot setting** box. This option maintains the setting value with the slot during swaps.

To learn more, see [Azure Functions Deployment slots](functions-deployment-slots).

## Run a disabled function

You can still cause a disabled function to run by supplying the master access key (`_master`

) in a REST request to the endpoint URL of the disabled function. In this way, you can develop and validate functions in Azure in a disabled state while preventing them from being accessed by others. Using any other type of key in the request returns an HTTP 404 response.

Caution

Due to the elevated permissions in your function app granted by the master key, you shouldn't share this key with third parties or distribute it in native client applications. Use caution when choosing the admin HTTP access level for your function endpoints.

To learn more about the master key, see [Understand keys](function-keys-how-to#understand-keys). To learn more about calling non-HTTP triggered functions, see [Manually run a non HTTP-triggered function](functions-manually-run-non-http).

## Disable functions locally

Functions can be disabled in the same way when running locally. To disable a function named `QueueTrigger`

, add an entry to the Values collection in the local.settings.json file, as follows:

```
{
"IsEncrypted": false,
"Values": {
"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
"AzureWebJobs.QueueTrigger.Disabled": true
}
}
```


## Considerations

Keep the following considerations in mind when you disable functions:

When you disable an HTTP triggered function by using the methods described in this article, the endpoint can still be accessed when running on your local computer and

[in the portal](#run-a-disabled-function).At this time, function names that contain a hyphen (

`-`

) can't be disabled when running on Linux. If you plan to disable your functions when running on Linux, don't use hyphens in your function names.

## Next steps

This article is about disabling automatic triggers. For more information about triggers, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings).

# Azure Functions extension bundles

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how extension bundles enable your function code to use all of the [triggers and bindings that Azure Functions supports](functions-triggers-bindings). You also learn about the support levels and policies for your apps when you use extension bundles.

This article applies only to Azure Functions developers who use non-.NET languages. To learn how to add binding extensions directly to your C# function apps, see [Register Azure Functions binding extensions](functions-bindings-register).

## Overview

Extension bundles add a predefined set of compatible binding extensions to your function app. A bundle contains all of the binding extensions currently supported by Functions. Extension bundles are versioned. Each version contains a specific set of binding extension versions that are verified to work together.

You should always use the latest bundle version in your app, when possible.

When you create an Azure Functions project from a non-.NET template, extension bundles are already enabled in the app's `host.json`

file.

## Define an extension bundle reference

You define an extension bundle reference in the `host.json`

project file by adding an `extensionBundle`

section, as in this example:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

The following properties are available in `extensionBundle`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`id` |
The namespace for Azure Functions extension bundles. |
`version` |
The version range of the bundle to install. The Azure Functions runtime always chooses the maximum permissible version that the version range or interval defines. For example, a `version` value range of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)` allows all bundle versions from 4.0.0 up to (but not including) 5.0.0. For more information, see the
|

Tip

You might also see the version range defined in your *host.json* as `[4.*, 5.0.0)`

, which is interpreted the same as `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

.

## Bundle versions

This table lists all `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle`

versions and the current [support state](#extension-bundles-support-policy):

| Bundle version | Version in host.json | Support state* |
|---|---|---|
|

`[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

`[4.*, 5.0.0)`

[3.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/blob/main-v3/src/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle/extensions.json)`[3.3.0, 4.0.0)`

[2.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/blob/main-v2/src/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle/extensions.json)`[2.*, 3.0.0)`

[1.x](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/blob/v1.x/src/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle/extensions.json)`[1.*, 2.0.0)`

* Deprecated bundle versions can include deprecated binding extension versions. For optimal supportability and reliability, you should [upgrade to bundle version 4.x](#upgrade-extension-bundles).

By default, extension bundles are defined via version ranges, which guarantees that the latest minor bundle version is used. Select a version link in the table to review the `extensions.json`

file that defines the latest bundle for that major version.

## Considerations for extension bundles

Keep these considerations in mind when you work with extension bundles:

- When possible, you should set a
`version`

range value in`host.json`

from the preceding table, such as`[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

, instead of defining a custom range. - Use the latest version range to obtain optimal app performance and access to the latest features.
- In the unlikely event that you can't use an extension bundle, you must instead
[explicitly install extensions](functions-bindings-register#explicitly-install-extensions). - When updating the extensions used by a deployed app, Functions downloads new extension versions from the
`cdn.functions.azure.com`

endpoint. For extension updates to succeed, the`cdn.functions.azure.com`

endpoint must be accessible to your function app.

## Upgrade extension bundles

It's important to keep your bundle version up-to-date so that your apps can continue to be eligible for new features, security patches, and performance optimizations.

To upgrade your app to the most recent bundle, edit the host.json file in the root of your app project. Set the value of `extensionBundle.version`

to `[4.0.0,5.0.0)`

, which should look like this in your host.json file:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


Keep these considerations in mind when upgrading the extension bundle version used by your app:

- The contents of the latest 4.x bundle can always be found at
[this release page in the repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). - Review the reference documentation for any extensions used by your app to look for any breaking changes between versions. For the list of extension versions included in the default bundle, see the
`extension.json`

project file linked[from this table](#bundle-versions). You can review the[bundle releases page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases)in the bundles repo for specific bundle version tags. - Always verify your app locally after upgrading the bundle version to ensure compatibility with the updated extensions. You can use the
[func start](functions-core-tools-reference#func-start)command in Azure Functions Core Tools or F5 in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to run your function app locally. - The way that you trigger extensions to be updated based on changes to the bundle version in the host.json file depends on your app environment:
- Local project: extensions are updated locally when Core Tools starts, either from the
`func start`

command or when debugging in your development tools. - Function app: extensions are updated when you deploy the updated host.json file to your function app in Azure.

- Local project: extensions are updated locally when Core Tools starts, either from the

## Extension bundles support policy

Major version releases of an extension bundle can occur when there are breaking change updates in one of the contained binding extensions. These extension breaking changes require updates to the bundle to remain compatible with the underlying Azure SDKs. Upgrading the bundle ensures your apps continue to receive new features, performance improvements, and full product support.

Note

Because extension bundle updates are driven by updates in the underlying Azure SDKs, the support cycle for extension bundles generally follows the [support policies of the underlying Azure SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_support.html).

Microsoft notifies you when an extension bundle or a binding extension version is deprecated. These notifications might appear in different parts of your Functions experience, such as in host logs, Application Insights tables, or the Azure portal. When you encounter these notifications, you must start the process of planning for and upgrading your function apps to the latest supported extension bundle version.

The support cycle of extension bundles follows these distinct phases:

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
Preview |
Prerelease versions of specific binding extensions are maintained in a preview extension bundle (`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview` ). You can use this preview extension bundle to take advantage of preview extensions and new behaviors in existing extensions before they reach general availability (GA). For more information, see
|
Active |
The most recent major version of extension bundles is considered to be the active version. We recommend this version for your function apps. |
Deprecation |
The bundle version is superseded by a more recent release and is now deprecated. After a bundle is deprecated, it only receives critical bug fixes and security updates for a limited overlap period. This overlap is typically at least 12 months, which gives you time to plan, test, and upgrade your apps to the latest bundle version. Function apps that continue to use a deprecated bundle can still run on the platform. However, to ensure access to new features, performance improvements, security patches, and full support, you must upgrade your function apps to a supported bundle version. |

You can view the extension bundle versions and their included extensions in the [Azure Functions extension bundles repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases). You can also view the Azure SDK releases page for an inventory of all Functions extensions. You can find individual .NET packages on [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org/).

## Work with preview extension bundles

Keep these considerations in mind when you choose to use a non-GA extension bundle:

- Preview bundles can include features that are still under development and not yet ready for production use. They're intended for evaluation and testing in nonproduction environments.
- Breaking changes occur between preview versions without prior notice. They can include changes to:
- Trigger and binding definitions.
- Extensions included in the preview.
- Performance characteristics and stability.

- Security updates might require you to upgrade versions.
- You must completely test preview bundles in nonproduction environments and avoid using preview bundles in production. When you must use a preview bundle in production, take these extra precautions:
- Pin your bundle to a specific, well-tested bundle version instead of to a range. Pinning prevents automatic upgrading of your bundle version before you have a chance to verify the update in a nonproduction environment.
- Move your app to using a GA bundle version as soon as the functionality becomes available in a fully supported bundle release.

- To stay informed about bundle updates, including moving from preview to GA, you should:
- Monitor releases of preview bundle versions on the
[release page for extension bundles](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases). - Monitor
[extension-specific reference documentation](functions-triggers-bindings). - Review the NuGet package versions of specific preview extensions that you're using.
- Track significant updates or changes in the change logs published on NuGet.org for each preview extension.

- Monitor releases of preview bundle versions on the

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) lets you develop functions locally and deploy them to Azure. If this experience is your first with Azure Functions, you can learn more at [An introduction to Azure Functions](functions-overview).

The Azure Functions extension provides these benefits:

- Edit, build, and run functions on your local development computer.
- Publish your Azure Functions project directly to Azure.
- Write your functions in various languages while taking advantage of the benefits of Visual Studio Code.

Important

Don't mix local development and portal development for a single function app. When you publish from a local project to a function app, the deployment process overwrites any functions that you developed in the portal.

## Prerequisites

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)installed on one of the[supported platforms](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements#_platforms).[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). You can also install the[Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack), which is recommended for working with Azure resources.An active

[Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing). If you don't yet have an account, you can create one from the extension in Visual Studio Code.

You also need these prerequisites to [run and debug your functions locally](#run-functions-locally). They're not required to just create or publish projects to Azure Functions.

- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local), which enables an integrated local debugging experience. When you have the Azure Functions extension installed, the easiest way to install or update Core Tools is by running the`Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools`

command from the command palette.

## Create an Azure Functions project

The Functions extension lets you create the required function app project at the same time you create your first function. Use these steps to create an HTTP-triggered function in a new project. An [HTTP trigger](functions-bindings-http-webhook) is the simplest function trigger template to demonstrate.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

. Select the directory location for your project workspace, then choose**Select**.You can either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace, but don't choose a project folder that's already part of a workspace.

You can instead run the command

`Azure Functions: Create New Containerized Project...`

to also get a Dockerfile generated for the project.When prompted,

**Select a language**for your project. If necessary, choose a specific language version.Select the

**HTTP trigger**function template, or select**Skip for now**to create a project without a function. You can always[add a function to your project](#add-a-function-to-your-project)later.Tip

To view additional templates, select the

**Change template filter**option and set the value to**Core**or**All**.For the function name, enter

**HttpExample**, select Enter, then select**Function**authorization.This authorization level requires that you provide a

[function key](function-keys-how-to)when you call the function endpoint.From the dropdown list, select

**Add to workspace**.In the

**Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?**window, select**Yes**.

Visual Studio Code creates a function in your chosen language and in the template for an HTTP-triggered function.

### Generated project files

The project template creates a project in your chosen language and installs the required dependencies. For any language, the new project has these files:

**host.json**: Lets you configure the Functions host. These settings apply when you're running functions locally and when you're running them in Azure. For more information, see[host.json reference](functions-host-json).**local.settings.json**: Maintains settings used when you're locally running functions. These settings are used only when you're running functions locally. For more information, see[Local settings file](#local-settings).Important

Because the

**local.settings.json**file can contain secrets, make sure to exclude the file from your project source control.**Dockerfile**(optional): Lets you create a containerized function app from your project by using an approved base image for your project. You only get this file when you run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Containerized Project...`

. You can add a Dockerfile to an existing project by using the`func init --docker-only`

command in[Core Tools](functions-core-tools-reference#func-init).

An HttpExample.cs class library file, the contents of which vary depending on whether your project runs in an [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#project-structure) or [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library#functions-class-library-project) with the Functions host.

These files are created:

A pom.xml file in the root folder that defines the project and deployment parameters, including project dependencies and the

[Java version](functions-reference-java#java-versions). The pom.xml also contains information about the Azure resources that are created during a deployment.A

[Functions.java file](functions-reference-java#triggers-and-annotations)in your src path that implements the function.

Files generated depend on the chosen Node.js programming model for Functions:

An HttpExample folder is created that contains:

- The
[function.json definition file](functions-reference-powershell#folder-structure) - A run.ps1 file, which contains the function code.

Files generated depend on the chosen Python programming model for Functions:

At this point, you can [run your HTTP trigger function locally](#run-functions-locally).

## Add a function to your project

You can add a new function to an existing project by using one of the predefined Functions trigger templates. To add a new function trigger, select F1 to open the command palette, then find and run the command **Azure Functions: Create Function**. Follow the prompts to choose your trigger type and define the required attributes of the trigger. If your trigger requires an access key or connection string to connect to a service, get that item ready before you create the function trigger.

This action adds a new C# class library (.cs) file to your project.

This action adds a new Java (.java) file to your project.

This action's results depend on the Node.js model version.

This action creates a new folder in the project. The folder contains a new **function.json** file and the new PowerShell code file.

This action's results depends on the Python model version.

## Connect to services

You can connect your function to other Azure services by adding input and output bindings. Bindings connect your function to other services without you having to write the connection code.

For example, the way that you define an output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your process model:

If necessary,

[add a reference to the package that supports your binding extension](#install-binding-extensions).Update the function method to add an attribute that defines the binding parameter, like

`QueueOutput`

for a queue output binding. You can use a`MultiResponse`

object to return multiple messages or multiple output streams.

For example, to add an output binding that writes data to a storage queue, update the function method to add a binding parameter defined by using the [ QueueOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.queueoutput) annotation. The

[object represents the messages that are written to an output binding when the function completes.](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.outputbinding)

`OutputBinding<T>`

For example, the way that you define the output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your Node.js model version:

Visual Studio Code lets you add bindings to your function.json file by following a convenient set of prompts.

To add a binding, open the command pallet (F1) and type **Azure Functions: add binding...**, choose the function for the new binding, and then follow the prompts, which vary depending on the type of binding being added to the function.

The following are example prompts to define a new storage output binding:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
Select binding direction |
`out` |
The binding is an output binding. |
Select binding with direction |
`Azure Queue Storage` |
The binding is an Azure Storage queue binding. |
The name used to identify this binding in your code |
`msg` |
Name that identifies the binding parameter referenced in your code. |
The queue to which the message will be sent |
`outqueue` |
The name of the queue that the binding writes to. When the queueName doesn't exist, the binding creates it on first use. |
Select setting from "local.settings.json" |
`MyStorageConnection` |
The name of an application setting that contains the connection string for the storage account. The `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting contains the connection string for the storage account you created with the function app. |

You can also right-click (Ctrl+click on macOS) directly on the **function.json** file in your function folder, select **Add binding**, and follow the same prompts.

In this example, the following binding is added to the `bindings`

array in your function.json file:

```
{
"type": "queue",
"direction": "out",
"name": "msg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"connection": "MyStorageConnection"
}
```


For example, the way you define the output binding that writes data to a storage queue depends on your Python model version:

The following example shows the function definition after adding a [Queue Storage output binding](functions-bindings-storage-queue-output) to an [HTTP triggered function](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger):

Because an HTTP triggered function also returns an HTTP response, the function returns a `MultiResponse`

object, which represents both the HTTP and queue output.

```
[Function("HttpExample")]
public static MultiResponse Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequest req,
FunctionContext executionContext)
{
```


This example is the definition of the `MultiResponse`

object that includes the output binding:

```
public class MultiResponse
{
[QueueOutput("outqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public string[] Messages { get; set; }
public IActionResult HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


When applying that example to your own project, you might need to change `HttpRequest`

to `HttpRequestData`

and `IActionResult`

to `HttpResponseData`

, depending on if you are using [ASP.NET Core integration](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#aspnet-core-integration) or not.

Messages are sent to the queue when the function completes. The way you define the output binding depends on your process model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=csharp#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

```
@FunctionName("HttpExample")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@QueueOutput(name = "msg", queueName = "outqueue",
connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") OutputBinding<String> msg,
final ExecutionContext context) {
```

const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const sendToQueue = output.storageQueue({
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'AzureWebJobsStorage',
});
app.http('HttpExample', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [sendToQueue],

try {
context.log(`Http function processed request for url "${request.url}"`);
const name = request.query.get('name') || (await request.text());

if (name) {
const msg = `Name passed to the function ${name}`;
context.extraOutputs.set(sendToQueue, [msg]);
return { body: msg };
} else {
context.log('Missing required data');
return { status: 404, body: 'Missing required data' };
}
} catch (error) {
context.log(`Error: ${error}`);
return { status: 500, body: 'Internal Server Error' };
}
},
});
```


The way you define the output binding depends on the version of your Node.js model. For more information, including links to example binding code that you can refer to, see [Add bindings to a function](add-bindings-existing-function?tabs=javascript#manually-add-bindings-based-on-examples).

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create Azure resources

Before you can publish your Functions project to Azure, you must have a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription to run your code. The function app provides an execution context for your functions. When you publish from Visual Studio Code to a function app in Azure, the project is packaged and deployed to the selected function app in your Azure subscription.

When you create a function app in Azure, you can choose either a quick function app create path using defaults or a path that gives you advanced options, such as using existing Azure resources. This way, you have more control over creating the remote resources.

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Create an Azure Container Apps deployment

Important

A new hosting method for running Azure Functions directly in Azure Container Apps is now available. See [Native Azure Functions Support in Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-native-azure-functions-support-in-azure-container-apps/4414039). This integration allows you to use the full features and capabilities of Azure Container Apps. You also benefit from the functions programming model and simplicity of autoscaling provided by Azure Functions.

We recommend this approach for most new workloads. For more information, see [Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview).

Use Visual Studio Code to create Azure resources for a containerized code project. When the extension detects the presence of a Dockerfile during resource creation, it asks if you want to deploy the container image instead of just the code. Visual Studio Code creates an Azure Container Apps environment for your containerized code project that's integrated with Azure Functions. For more information, see [Azure Container Apps hosting of Azure Functions](functions-container-apps-hosting).

Note

Container deployment requires the [Azure Container Apps extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecontainerapps). This extension is currently in preview.

The create process depends on whether you choose a quick create or you need to use advanced options:

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure...`

.When prompted, choose

**Container image**.Provide the following information at the prompts:

Prompt Selection **Select subscription**(optional)Choose the subscription to use. You won't see this prompt when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a name for the new function app**Type a name that's valid in a URL path. The name you type is validated to make sure that it's globally unique in Functions. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**so that your app connects to remote resources by using Microsoft Entra ID authentication instead of using shared secrets (connection strings and keys), which are less secure.**Select a location for new resources**For better performance, choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you.When prompted,

**Enter a name for the container app environment**.The extension shows the status of individual resources as they're being created in Azure in the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel.

For more information about the resources required to run your containerized functions in Container Apps, see [Required resources](functions-infrastructure-as-code?pivots=container-apps#required-resources).

Note

You can't currently use Visual Studio Code to deploy a containerized function app to an Azure Functions-integrated Container Apps environment. You must instead publish your container image to a container registry and then set that registry image as the deployment source for your Container Apps-hosted function app. For more information, see [Create your function app in a container](functions-how-to-custom-container#create-your-function-app-in-a-container) and [Update an image in the registry](functions-how-to-custom-container#update-an-image-in-the-registry).

## Deploy project files

Set up [continuous deployment](functions-continuous-deployment) so that your function app in Azure updates when you update source files in the connected source location. You can also deploy your project files from Visual Studio Code. When you publish from Visual Studio Code, you can take advantage of the [Zip deploy technology](functions-deployment-technologies#zip-deploy).

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Get the URL of an HTTP triggered function in Azure

To call an HTTP-triggered function from a client, you need the function's URL, which is available after deployment to your function app. This URL includes any required function keys. You can use the extension to get these URLs for your deployed functions. If you just want to run the remote function in Azure, [use the Execute function now](#run-functions-in-azure) functionality of the extension.

Select F1 to open the command palette, and then find and run the command

**Azure Functions: Copy Function URL**.Follow the prompts to select your function app in Azure and then the specific HTTP trigger that you want to invoke.


The function URL is copied to the clipboard, along with any required keys passed by the `code`

query parameter. Use an HTTP tool to submit POST requests, or a browser to submit GET requests to the remote function.

When the extension gets the URL of a function in Azure, it uses your Azure account to automatically retrieve the keys needed to start the function. [Learn more about function access keys](security-concepts#function-access-keys). Starting non-HTTP triggered functions requires using the admin key.

## Run functions

The Azure Functions extension lets you run individual functions. You can run functions either in your project on your local development computer or in your Azure subscription.

For HTTP trigger functions, the extension calls the HTTP endpoint. For other kinds of triggers, the extension calls administrator APIs to start the function. The message body of the request sent to the function depends on the trigger type. When a trigger requires test data, you're prompted to enter data in a specific JSON format.

### Run functions in Azure

To execute a function in Azure from Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

In the command palette, enter

**Azure Functions: Execute function now**, and select your Azure subscription.From the list, choose your function app in Azure. If you don't see your function app, make sure you're signed in to the correct subscription.

From the list, choose the function that you want to run. In

**Enter request body**, type the message body of the request, and press Enter to send this request message to your function.The default text in

**Enter request body**indicates the body's format. If your function app has no functions, a notification error is shown with this error.When the function executes in Azure and returns a response, Visual Studio Code shows a notification.


You can also run your function from the **Azure: Functions** area by opening the shortcut menu for the function that you want to run from your function app in your Azure subscription, and then selecting **Execute Function Now...**.

When you run your functions in Azure from Visual Studio Code, the extension uses your Azure account to automatically retrieve the keys needed to start the function. [Learn more about function access keys](security-concepts#function-access-keys). Starting non-HTTP triggered functions requires using the admin key.

### Run functions locally

The local runtime is the same runtime that hosts your function app in Azure. The runtime reads local settings from the [local.settings.json file](#local-settings). To run your Functions project locally, you must meet [more requirements](#prerequisites).

#### Configure the project to run locally

The Functions runtime uses an Azure Storage account internally for all trigger types except HTTP and webhooks. Set the **Values.AzureWebJobsStorage** key to a valid Azure Storage account connection string.

This section uses the [Azure Storage extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage) with [Azure Storage Explorer](https://storageexplorer.com/) to connect to and retrieve the storage connection string.

To set the storage account connection string:

In Visual Studio, open

**Cloud Explorer**, expand**Storage Account**>**Your Storage Account**, then select**Properties**and copy the**Primary Connection String**value.In your project, open the local.settings.json file and set the value of the

**AzureWebJobsStorage**key to the connection string you copied.Repeat the previous step to add unique keys to the

**Values**array for any other connections required by your functions.

For more information, see [Local settings file](#local-settings).

#### Debug functions locally

To debug your functions, select F5. If [Core Tools](functions-run-local) isn't available, you're prompted to install it. When Core Tools is installed and running, output is shown in the Terminal. This step is the same as running the `func start`

Core Tools command from the Terminal, but with extra build tasks and an attached debugger.

When the project is running, you can use the **Execute Function Now...** feature of the extension to trigger your functions as you would when the project is deployed to Azure. With the project running in debug mode, breakpoints are hit in Visual Studio Code as you would expect.

In the command palette, enter

**Azure Functions: Execute function now**and choose**Local project**.Choose the function you want to run in your project and type the message body of the request in

**Enter request body**. Press Enter to send this request message to your function. The default text in**Enter request body**should indicate the format of the body. If your function app has no functions, a notification error is shown with this error.When the function runs locally and after the response is received, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.

Keys aren't required when running locally. This rule applies to both function keys and admin-level keys.

## Work with app settings locally

When your function app runs in Azure, settings required by your functions are [stored encrypted in app settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings). During local development, these settings are instead added to the `Values`

collection in the *local.settings.json* file. The *local.settings.json* file also stores settings used by local development tools.

Items in the `Values`

collection in your project's *local.settings.json* file are intended to mirror items in your function app's [application settings](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) in Azure.

By default, these settings aren't migrated automatically when you publish the project to Azure. After publishing finishes, you can choose to publish settings from local.settings.json to your function app in Azure. To learn more, see [Publish application settings](#publish-application-settings).

Values in **ConnectionStrings** are never published.

Your code can read the function application settings values as environment variables. For more information, see [Environment variables](functions-dotnet-class-library#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-java#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-node#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-powershell#environment-variables).

- Your code can read the function app settings values as environment variables. For more information, see
[Environment variables](functions-reference-python#environment-variables).

## Application settings in Azure

The settings in the local.settings.json file in your project should match the application settings in the function app in Azure. You must add any new settings to both local.settings.json and the function app in Azure. These settings aren't uploaded automatically when you publish the project. Likewise, you must download any settings that you create in your function app [in the portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#settings) to your local project.

### Publish application settings

The easiest way to publish the required settings to your function app in Azure is to use the **Upload settings** link that appears after you publish your project:


You can also publish settings by using the **Azure Functions: Upload Local Setting** command in the command palette. You can add individual settings to application settings in Azure by using the **Azure Functions: Add New Setting** command.

Tip

Be sure to save your local.settings.json file before you publish it.

If the local file is encrypted, the process decrypts it, publishes it, and encrypts it again. If conflicting values exist in the two locations, you're prompted to choose how to proceed.

View existing app settings in the **Azure: Functions** area by expanding your subscription, your function app, and **Application Settings**.


### Download settings from Azure

If you create application settings in Azure, you can download them into your local.settings.json file by using the **Azure Functions: Download Remote Settings** command.

As with uploading, if the local file is encrypted, the process decrypts it, updates it, and encrypts it again. If conflicting values exist in the two locations, you're prompted to choose how to proceed.

## Install binding extensions

Except for HTTP and timer triggers, bindings are implemented in extension packages.

You must explicitly install the extension packages for the triggers and bindings that need them. The specific package you install depends on your project's process model.

Run the [dotnet add package](/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package) command in the Terminal window to install the extension packages that you need in your project. This template demonstrates how you add a binding for an [isolated-process class library](dotnet-isolated-process-guide):

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.<BINDING_TYPE_NAME> --version <TARGET_VERSION>
```


Replace `<BINDING_TYPE_NAME>`

with the name of the package that contains the binding you need. You can find the desired binding reference article in the [list of supported bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

Replace `<TARGET_VERSION>`

in the example with a specific version of the package, such as `3.0.0-beta5`

. Valid versions are listed on the individual package pages at [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The major versions that correspond to the current Functions runtime are specified in the reference article for the binding.

Tip

You can also use the **NuGet** commands in [the C# Dev Kit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/package-management#_add-a-package) to install binding extension packages.

C# script uses [extension bundles](extension-bundles).

The easiest way to install binding extensions is to enable [extension bundles](extension-bundles). When you enable bundles, a predefined set of extension packages is automatically installed.

To enable extension bundles, open the host.json file and update its contents to match the following code:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[3.*, 4.0.0)"
}
}
```


If for some reason you can't use an extension bundle to install binding extensions for your project, see [Explicitly install extensions](functions-bindings-register#explicitly-install-extensions).

## Monitoring functions

When you [run functions locally](#run-functions-locally), Core Tools streams log data to the Terminal console. You can also get log data when your Functions project runs in a function app in Azure. You can connect to streaming logs in Azure to see near-real-time log data. You should enable Application Insights for a more complete understanding of how your function app behaves.

### Streaming logs

When you're developing an application, it's often useful to see logging information in near-real time. You can view a stream of log files generated by your functions. Turn on logs from the command pallet with the `Azure Functions: Start streaming logs`

command. This output is an example of streaming logs for a request to an HTTP-triggered function:


To learn more, see [Streaming logs](functions-monitoring?tabs=vs-code#streaming-logs).

### Application Insights

You should monitor the execution of your functions by integrating your function app with Application Insights. When you create a function app in the Azure portal, this integration occurs by default. When you create your function app during Visual Studio publishing, you need to integrate Application Insights yourself. To learn how, see [Enable Application Insights integration](configure-monitoring#enable-application-insights-integration).

To learn more about monitoring using Application Insights, see [Monitor Azure Functions](functions-monitoring).

## C# script projects

By default, all C# projects are created as [C# compiled class library projects](functions-dotnet-class-library). If you prefer to work with C# script projects instead, you must select C# script as the default language in the Azure Functions extension settings:

Select

**File**>**Preferences**>**Settings**.Go to

**User Settings**>**Extensions**>**Azure Functions**.Select

**C#Script**from**Azure Function: Project Language**.

After you complete these steps, calls made to the underlying Core Tools include the `--csx`

option, which generates and publishes C# script (.csx) project files. When you specify this default language, all projects that you create default to C# script projects. You're not prompted to choose a project language when a default is set. To create projects in other languages, you must change this setting or remove it from the user settings.json file. After you remove this setting, you're again prompted to choose your language when you create a project.

## Command palette reference

The Azure Functions extension provides a useful graphical interface for interacting with your function apps in Azure. The same functionality is also available as commands in the command palette (F1). These Azure Functions commands are available:

| Azure Functions command | Description |
|---|---|
Add New Settings |
Creates a new application setting in Azure. To learn more, see

# Azure Cosmos DB input binding for Azure Functions 2.x and higher

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure Cosmos DB input binding uses the SQL API to retrieve one or more Azure Cosmos DB documents and passes them to the input parameter of the function. The document ID or query parameters can be determined based on the trigger that invokes the function.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2).

Note

When the collection is [partitioned](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#logical-partitions), lookup operations must also specify the partition key value.

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

Unless otherwise noted, examples in this article target version 3.x of the [Azure Cosmos DB extension](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2). For use with extension version 4.x, you need to replace the string `collection`

in property and attribute names with `container`

.

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This section contains examples that require version 3.x of Azure Cosmos DB extension and 5.x of Azure Storage extension. If not already present in your function app, add reference to the following NuGet packages:

The examples refer to a simple `ToDoItem`

type:

```
[Function(nameof(DocByIdFromJSON))]
public void DocByIdFromJSON(
[QueueTrigger("todoqueueforlookup")] ToDoItemLookup toDoItemLookup,
[CosmosDBInput(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
containerName: "Items",
Connection = "CosmosDBConnection",
Id = "{ToDoItemId}",
PartitionKey = "{ToDoItemPartitionKeyValue}")] ToDoItem toDoItem)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed Id={toDoItemLookup?.ToDoItemId} Key={toDoItemLookup?.ToDoItemPartitionKeyValue}");
if (toDoItem == null)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"ToDo item not found");
}
else
{
_logger.LogInformation($"Found ToDo item, Description={toDoItem.Description}");
}
}
```


### Queue trigger, look up ID from JSON

The following example shows a function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by a JSON message in the storage queue. The queue trigger parses the JSON into an object of type `ToDoItemLookup`

, which contains the ID and partition key value to retrieve. That ID and partition key value are used to return a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
[Function(nameof(DocByIdFromJSON))]
public void DocByIdFromJSON(
[QueueTrigger("todoqueueforlookup")] ToDoItemLookup toDoItemLookup,
[CosmosDBInput(
databaseName: "ToDoItems",
containerName: "Items",
Connection = "CosmosDBConnection",
Id = "{ToDoItemId}",
PartitionKey = "{ToDoItemPartitionKeyValue}")] ToDoItem toDoItem)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed Id={toDoItemLookup?.ToDoItemId} Key={toDoItemLookup?.ToDoItemPartitionKeyValue}");
if (toDoItem == null)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"ToDo item not found");
}
else
{
_logger.LogInformation($"Found ToDo item, Description={toDoItem.Description}");
}
}
```


This section contains the following examples:

[HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string - String parameter](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-query-string---string-parameter-java)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string - POJO parameter](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-query-string---pojo-parameter-java)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-route-data-java)[HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data, using SqlQuery](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-route-data-using-sqlquery-java)[HTTP trigger, get multiple docs from route data, using SqlQuery](#http-trigger-get-multiple-docs-from-route-data-using-sqlquery-java)

The examples refer to a simple `ToDoItem`

type:

```
public class ToDoItem {
private String id;
private String description;
public String getId() {
return id;
}
public String getDescription() {
return description;
}
@Override
public String toString() {
return "ToDoItem={id=" + id + ",description=" + description + "}";
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string - String parameter

The following example shows a Java function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a document from the specified database and collection, in String form.

```
public class DocByIdFromQueryString {
@FunctionName("DocByIdFromQueryString")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@CosmosDBInput(name = "database",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
id = "{Query.id}",
partitionKey = "{Query.partitionKeyValue}",
connectionStringSetting = "Cosmos_DB_Connection_String")
Optional<String> item,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
context.getLogger().info("String from the database is " + (item.isPresent() ? item.get() : null));
// Convert and display
if (!item.isPresent()) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from Cosmos. Alternatively, we can parse the JSON string
// and return an enriched JSON object.
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(item.get())
.build();
}
}
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@CosmosDBInput`

annotation on function parameters whose value would come from Azure Cosmos DB. This annotation can be used with native Java types, POJOs, or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

.

### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string - POJO parameter

The following example shows a Java function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value used to retrieve a document from the specified database and collection. The document is then converted to an instance of the `ToDoItem`

POJO previously created, and passed as an argument to the function.

```
public class DocByIdFromQueryStringPojo {
@FunctionName("DocByIdFromQueryStringPojo")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@CosmosDBInput(name = "database",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
id = "{Query.id}",
partitionKey = "{Query.partitionKeyValue}",
connectionStringSetting = "Cosmos_DB_Connection_String")
ToDoItem item,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
context.getLogger().info("Item from the database is " + item);
// Convert and display
if (item == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(item)
.build();
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data

The following example shows a Java function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a route parameter to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a document from the specified database and collection, returning it as an `Optional<String>`

.

```
public class DocByIdFromRoute {
@FunctionName("DocByIdFromRoute")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS,
route = "todoitems/{partitionKeyValue}/{id}")
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@CosmosDBInput(name = "database",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
id = "{id}",
partitionKey = "{partitionKeyValue}",
connectionStringSetting = "Cosmos_DB_Connection_String")
Optional<String> item,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
context.getLogger().info("String from the database is " + (item.isPresent() ? item.get() : null));
// Convert and display
if (!item.isPresent()) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
// return JSON from Cosmos. Alternatively, we can parse the JSON string
// and return an enriched JSON object.
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(item.get())
.build();
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data, using SqlQuery

The following example shows a Java function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a route parameter to specify the ID to look up. That ID is used to retrieve a document from the specified database and collection, converting the result set to a `ToDoItem[]`

, since many documents may be returned, depending on the query criteria.

Note

If you need to query by just the ID, it is recommended to use a lookup, like the [previous examples](#http-trigger-look-up-id-from-query-string---pojo-parameter-java), as it consumes less [request units](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/request-units). Point read operations (GET) are [more efficient](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/optimize-cost-reads-writes) than queries by ID.

```
public class DocByIdFromRouteSqlQuery {
@FunctionName("DocByIdFromRouteSqlQuery")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS,
route = "todoitems2/{id}")
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@CosmosDBInput(name = "database",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
sqlQuery = "select * from Items r where r.id = {id}",
connectionStringSetting = "Cosmos_DB_Connection_String")
ToDoItem[] item,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
context.getLogger().info("Items from the database are " + item);
// Convert and display
if (item == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("Document not found.")
.build();
}
else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(item)
.build();
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, get multiple docs from route data, using SqlQuery

The following example shows a Java function that retrieves multiple documents. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a route parameter `desc`

to specify the string to search for in the `description`

field. The search term is used to retrieve a collection of documents from the specified database and collection, converting the result set to a `ToDoItem[]`

and passing it as an argument to the function.

```
public class DocsFromRouteSqlQuery {
@FunctionName("DocsFromRouteSqlQuery")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req",
methods = {HttpMethod.GET},
authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS,
route = "todoitems3/{desc}")
HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@CosmosDBInput(name = "database",
databaseName = "ToDoList",
collectionName = "Items",
sqlQuery = "select * from Items r where contains(r.description, {desc})",
connectionStringSetting = "Cosmos_DB_Connection_String")
ToDoItem[] items,
final ExecutionContext context) {
// Item list
context.getLogger().info("Parameters are: " + request.getQueryParameters());
context.getLogger().info("Number of items from the database is " + (items == null ? 0 : items.length));
// Convert and display
if (items == null) {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
.body("No documents found.")
.build();
}
else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(items)
.build();
}
}
}
```

```
import { app, input, InvocationContext, output } from '@azure/functions';
const cosmosInput = input.cosmosDB({
databaseName: 'MyDatabase',
collectionName: 'MyCollection',
id: '{queueTrigger}',
partitionKey: '{queueTrigger}',
connectionStringSetting: 'MyAccount_COSMOSDB',
});
const cosmosOutput = output.cosmosDB({
databaseName: 'MyDatabase',
collectionName: 'MyCollection',
createIfNotExists: false,
partitionKey: '{queueTrigger}',
connectionStringSetting: 'MyAccount_COSMOSDB',
});
interface MyDocument {
text: string;
}
export async function storageQueueTrigger1(queueItem: unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
const doc = <MyDocument>context.extraInputs.get(cosmosInput);
doc.text = 'This was updated!';
context.extraOutputs.set(cosmosOutput, doc);
}
app.storageQueue('storageQueueTrigger1', {
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
extraInputs: [cosmosInput],
extraOutputs: [cosmosOutput],
handler: storageQueueTrigger1,
});
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string

The following example shows a [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, input, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
const cosmosInput = input.cosmosDB({
databaseName: 'ToDoItems',
collectionName: 'Items',
id: '{Query.id}',
partitionKey: '{Query.partitionKeyValue}',
connectionStringSetting: 'CosmosDBConnection',
});
interface ToDoDocument {
description: string;
}
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const toDoItem = <ToDoDocument>context.extraInputs.get(cosmosInput);
if (!toDoItem) {
return {
status: 404,
body: 'ToDo item not found',
};
} else {
return {
body: `Found ToDo item, Description=${toDoItem.description}`,
};
}
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraInputs: [cosmosInput],
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data

The following example shows a [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses route data to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, input, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
const cosmosInput = input.cosmosDB({
databaseName: 'ToDoItems',
collectionName: 'Items',
id: '{id}',
partitionKey: '{partitionKeyValue}',
connectionStringSetting: 'CosmosDBConnection',
});
interface ToDoDocument {
description: string;
}
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const toDoItem = <ToDoDocument>context.extraInputs.get(cosmosInput);
if (!toDoItem) {
return {
status: 404,
body: 'ToDo item not found',
};
} else {
return {
body: `Found ToDo item, Description=${toDoItem.description}`,
};
}
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
route: 'todoitems/{partitionKeyValue}/{id}',
extraInputs: [cosmosInput],
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


### Queue trigger, get multiple docs, using SqlQuery

The following example shows a [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that retrieves multiple documents specified by a SQL query, using a queue trigger to customize the query parameters.

The queue trigger provides a parameter `departmentId`

. A queue message of `{ "departmentId" : "Finance" }`

would return all records for the finance department.

```
import { app, input, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
const cosmosInput = input.cosmosDB({
databaseName: 'MyDb',
collectionName: 'MyCollection',
sqlQuery: 'SELECT * from c where c.departmentId = {departmentId}',
connectionStringSetting: 'CosmosDBConnection',
});
interface MyDocument {}
export async function storageQueueTrigger1(queueItem: unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
const documents = <MyDocument[]>context.extraInputs.get(cosmosInput);
for (const document of documents) {
// operate on each document
}
}
app.storageQueue('storageQueueTrigger1', {
queueName: 'outqueue',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
extraInputs: [cosmosInput],
handler: storageQueueTrigger1,
});
```

### Queue trigger, look up ID from JSON

The following example demonstrates how to read and update a single Azure Cosmos DB document. The document's unique identifier is provided through JSON value in a queue message.

The Azure Cosmos DB input binding is listed first in the list of bindings found in the function's configuration file (*function.json*).

```
{
"name": "InputDocumentIn",
"type": "cosmosDB",
"databaseName": "MyDatabase",
"collectionName": "MyCollection",
"id": "{queueTrigger_payload_property}",
"partitionKey": "{queueTrigger_payload_property}",
"connectionStringSetting": "CosmosDBConnection",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"name": "InputDocumentOut",
"type": "cosmosDB",
"databaseName": "MyDatabase",
"collectionName": "MyCollection",
"createIfNotExists": false,
"partitionKey": "{queueTrigger_payload_property}",
"connectionStringSetting": "CosmosDBConnection",
"direction": "out"
}
```


The *run.ps1* file has the PowerShell code which reads the incoming document and outputs changes.

```
param($QueueItem, $InputDocumentIn, $TriggerMetadata)
$Document = $InputDocumentIn
$Document.text = 'This was updated!'
Push-OutputBinding -Name InputDocumentOut -Value $Document
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string

The following example demonstrates how to read and update a single Azure Cosmos DB document from a web API. The document's unique identifier is provided through a querystring parameter from the HTTP request, as defined in the binding's `"Id": "{Query.Id}"`

property.

The Azure Cosmos DB input binding is listed first in the list of bindings found in the function's configuration file (*function.json*).

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "cosmosDB",
"name": "ToDoItem",
"databaseName": "ToDoItems",
"collectionName": "Items",
"connectionStringSetting": "CosmosDBConnection",
"direction": "in",
"Id": "{Query.id}",
"PartitionKey": "{Query.partitionKeyValue}"
},
{
"authLevel": "anonymous",

"get",
"post"
]
},
{
"name": "Response",
"type": "http",
"direction": "out"
},
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The *run.ps1* file has the PowerShell code which reads the incoming document and outputs changes.

```
using namespace System.Net
param($Request, $ToDoItem, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host 'PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request'
if (-not $ToDoItem) {
Write-Host 'ToDo item not found'
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::NotFound
Body = $ToDoItem.Description
})
} else {
Write-Host "Found ToDo item, Description=$($ToDoItem.Description)"
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
Body = $ToDoItem.Description
})
}
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data

The following example demonstrates how to read and update a single Azure Cosmos DB document from a web API. The document's unique identifier is provided through a route parameter. The route parameter is defined in the HTTP request binding's `route`

property and referenced in the Azure Cosmos DB `"Id": "{Id}"`

binding property.

The Azure Cosmos DB input binding is listed first in the list of bindings found in the function's configuration file (*function.json*).

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "cosmosDB",
"name": "ToDoItem",
"databaseName": "ToDoItems",
"collectionName": "Items",
"connectionStringSetting": "CosmosDBConnection",
"direction": "in",
"Id": "{id}",
"PartitionKey": "{partitionKeyValue}"
},
{
"authLevel": "anonymous",
"name": "Request",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"methods": [
"get",

],
"route": "todoitems/{partitionKeyValue}/{id}"
},
{
"name": "Response",
"type": "http",
"direction": "out"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The *run.ps1* file has the PowerShell code which reads the incoming document and outputs changes.

```
using namespace System.Net
param($Request, $ToDoItem, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host 'PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request'
if (-not $ToDoItem) {
Write-Host 'ToDo item not found'
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::NotFound
Body = $ToDoItem.Description
})
} else {
Write-Host "Found ToDo item, Description=$($ToDoItem.Description)"
Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
Body = $ToDoItem.Description
})
}
```


### Queue trigger, get multiple docs, using SqlQuery

The following example demonstrates how to read multiple Azure Cosmos DB documents. The function's configuration file (*function.json*) defines the binding properties, which includes the `sqlQuery`

. The SQL statement provided to the `sqlQuery`

property selects the set of documents provided to the function.

```
{
"name": "Documents",
"type": "cosmosDB",
"direction": "in",
"databaseName": "MyDb",
"collectionName": "MyCollection",
"sqlQuery": "SELECT * from c where c.departmentId = {departmentId}",
"connectionStringSetting": "CosmosDBConnection"
}
```


The *run1.ps1* file has the PowerShell code which reads the incoming documents.

```
param($QueueItem, $Documents, $TriggerMetadata)
foreach ($Document in $Documents) {
# operate on each document
}
```


This section contains the following examples that read a single document by specifying an ID value from various sources:

The examples depend on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

### Using SDK-Type Bindings for Cosmos DB (Preview)

This example uses SDK types to directly access the underlying [ CosmosClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-cosmosdb/samples/cosmosdb_samples_cosmosclient/function_app.py) object provided by the Cosmos DB input binding:

The function loops through all the databases and logs their IDs.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import azurefunctions.extensions.bindings.cosmosdb as cosmos
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
@app.route(route="cosmos")
@app.cosmos_db_input(arg_name="client",
connection="CosmosDBConnection",
database_name=None,
container_name=None)
def get_docs(req: func.HttpRequest, client: cosmos.CosmosClient):
databases = client.list_databases()
for db in databases:
logging.info(f"Found database with ID: {db.get('id')}")
return "ok"
```


For examples of using other SDK types, see the [ ContainerProxy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-cosmosdb/samples/cosmosdb_samples_containerproxy/function_app.py) and

[samples. For a step-by-step tutorial on how to include SDK-type bindings in your function app, follow the](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-cosmosdb/samples/cosmosdb_samples_databaseproxy/function_app.py)

`DatabaseProxy`

[Python SDK Bindings for CosmosDB Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-cosmosdb-sdk-bindings-python).

To learn more, including what other SDK type bindings are supported, see [SDK type bindings](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

### Queue trigger, look up ID from JSON

The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB input binding. The function reads a single document and updates the document's text value.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.queue_trigger(arg_name="msg",
queue_name="outqueue",
connection="AzureWebJobsStorage")
@app.cosmos_db_input(arg_name="documents",
database_name="MyDatabase",
collection_name="MyCollection",
id="{msg.payload_property}",
partition_key="{msg.payload_property}",
connection_string_setting="MyAccount_COSMOSDB")
@app.cosmos_db_output(arg_name="outputDocument",
database_name="MyDatabase",
collection_name="MyCollection",
connection_string_setting="MyAccount_COSMOSDB")
def test_function(msg: func.QueueMessage,
inputDocument: func.DocumentList,
outputDocument: func.Out[func.Document]):
doc = inputDocument[0]
doc["text"] = "This was updated!"
outputDocument.set(doc)
print(f"Updated document.")
```


### HTTP trigger, look up ID from query string

The following example shows a function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses a query string to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

### HTTP trigger, look up ID from route data

The following example shows a function that retrieves a single document. The function is triggered by an HTTP request that uses route data to specify the ID and partition key value to look up. That ID and partition key value are used to retrieve a `ToDoItem`

document from the specified database and collection.

### Queue trigger, get multiple docs, using SqlQuery

The following example shows an Azure Cosmos DB input binding Python function that uses the binding. The function retrieves multiple documents specified by a SQL query, using a queue trigger to customize the query parameters.

The queue trigger provides a parameter `departmentId`

. A queue message of `{ "departmentId" : "Finance" }`

would return all records for the finance department.

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#azure-cosmos-db-v2-input).

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account being queried. For more information, see
|

**DatabaseName****ContainerName****PartitionKey**[partitioned](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#logical-partitions)containers.**Id**[binding expressions](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns). Don't set both the`Id`

and `SqlQuery`

properties. If you don't set either one, the entire container is retrieved.**SqlQuery**`SELECT * FROM c where c.departmentId = {departmentId}`

. Don't set both the `Id`

and `SqlQuery`

properties. If you don't set either one, the entire container is retrieved.**PreferredLocations**`East US,South Central US,North Europe`

.## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

Python v2 functions are defined using the `cosmos_db_input`

decorator, which supports these properties, depending on the extension version:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The variable name used in function code that represents the list of documents with changes. |
`database_name` |
The name of the Azure Cosmos DB database with the collection being monitored. |
`container_name` |
The name of the Azure Cosmos DB collection being monitored. |
`connection` |
The connection string of the Azure Cosmos DB being monitored. |
`partition_key` |
The partition key of the Azure Cosmos DB being monitored. |
`id` |
The ID of the document to retrieve. |

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

From the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@CosmosDBInput`

annotation on parameters that read from Azure Cosmos DB. The annotation supports the following properties:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, where properties differ by extension version:

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `cosmosDB` . |
direction |
Must be set to `in` . |
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the list of documents with changes. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting container that specifies how to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB account being monitored. For more information, see
|

**databaseName****containerName****partitionKey**[partitioned](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview#logical-partitions)containers.**id**[binding expressions](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns). Don't set both the`id`

properties. If you don't set either one, the entire container is retrieved.**sqlQuery**`SELECT * FROM c where c.departmentId = {departmentId}`

. Don't set both the `id`

and `sqlQuery`

properties. If you don't set either one, the entire container is retrieved.**preferredLocations**`East US,South Central US,North Europe`

.See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

When the function exits successfully, any changes made to the input document are automatically persisted.

The parameter type supported by the Cosmos DB input binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to process a single document, the Cosmos DB input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| JSON serializable types | Functions attempts to deserialize the JSON data of the document into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |

When you want the function to process multiple documents from a query, the Cosmos DB input binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`IEnumerable<T>` where `T` is a JSON serializable type |
An enumeration of entities returned by the query. Each entry represents one document. |
1 |

[Database](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.database)1[Container](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.container)11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB 4.4.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.CosmosDB/4.4.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

From the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), the [@CosmosDBInput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.cosmosdbinput) annotation exposes Azure Cosmos DB data to the function. This annotation can be used with native Java types, POJOs, or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

.

Updates to documents are not made automatically upon function exit. To update documents in a function use an [output binding](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-input). See the [PowerShell example](#example) for more detail.

Data is made available to the function via a `DocumentList`

parameter. Changes made to the document are not automatically persisted.
Functions also support Python SDK type bindings for Azure Cosmos, which lets you work with data using these underlying SDK types:

Important

Support for CosmosDB SDK types for Python is in Preview and is only supported for the Python v2 programming model. For more information, see

[SDK types in Python].

## Connections

The `connectionStringSetting`

/`connection`

and `leaseConnectionStringSetting`

/`leaseConnection`

properties are references to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Azure Cosmos DB. They may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections). This option is only available for the`connection`

and`leaseConnection`

versions from[version 4.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2?tabs=extensionv4).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

The connection string for your database account should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the connection property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 4.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2?tabs=extensionv4), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the connection property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account Endpoint | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__accountEndpoint` |
The Azure Cosmos DB account endpoint URI. | https://<database_account_name>.documents.azure.com:443/ |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

Cosmos DB does not use Azure RBAC for data operations. Instead, it uses a [Cosmos DB built-in RBAC system](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac) which is built on similar concepts. You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your database account at runtime. Azure RBAC Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Azure Cosmos DB extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles1 |
|---|---|
Trigger2 |
|

[Cosmos DB Built-in Data Reader](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#built-in-role-definitions)[Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac#built-in-role-definitions)1 These roles cannot be used in an Azure RBAC role assignment. See the [Cosmos DB built-in RBAC system](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-rbac) documentation for details on how to assign these roles.

2 When using identity, Cosmos DB treats container creation as a management operation. It is not available as a data-plane operation for the trigger. You will need to ensure that you create the containers needed by the trigger (including the lease container) before setting up your function.

This article shows you how to host remote [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) servers on Azure Functions. You also learn how to use built-in authentication to configure server endpoint authorization and better secure your AI tools.

There are two ways to host a remote MCP server in Azure Functions:

| MCP server option | Description | Best for... |
|---|---|---|
MCP extension server |

[Azure Functions MCP extension](functions-bindings-mcp)to create custom MCP servers, where the extension trigger lets you define your tool endpoints. These servers are supported in all Functions languages and are developed, deployed, and managed as any other function app.[bindings-based programming model](functions-triggers-bindings).**Self-hosted server**Note

The ability to have Azure Functions host MCP servers you create using official MCP SDKs is currently in preview.

This tutorial covers both MCP server options supported by Functions. Select the tab that best fits your scenario.

In this tutorial, you use Visual Studio Code to:

- Create an MCP server project using the MCP extension.
- Run and verify your MCP server locally.
- Create a function app in Azure.
- Deploy your MCP server project.
- Enable built-in authentication.

Important

This article currently supports only C#, Python, and TypeScript. To complete the quickstart, select one of these supported languages at the top of the article.

This article supports version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions.

This article supports version 2 of the Python programming model for Azure Functions.

## Prerequisites

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)with these extensions:[Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions). This extension requires[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local)and tries to install it when it's not available.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can also run Azure CLI commands in[Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview).An Azure account with an active subscription.

[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Create your MCP server project

Use Visual Studio Code to locally create an MCP server project in your preferred language.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

.Choose the directory location for your project workspace and choose

**Select**. You should either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace. Don't choose a project folder that is already part of a workspace.

Provide the following information at the prompts:

Prompt Selection **Select a project type**Choose `C#`

.**Select a .NET runtime**Choose `.NET 8.0 LTS`

.**Select a template for your project's first function**Choose `MCP Tool trigger`

.**Provide a function name**Type `McpTrigger`

.**Provide a namespace**Type `My.Functions`

.**Authorization level**Choose `FUNCTION`

, which requires access key when connecting to the remote MCP server.**Select how you would like to open your project**Choose `Open in current window`

.

Provide the following information at the prompts:

Prompt Selection **Select a project type**Choose `TypeScript`

.**Select a template for your project's first function**Choose `MCP Tool trigger`

.**Provide a function name**Type `mcpToolTrigger`

.**Authorization level**Choose `FUNCTION`

, which requires access key when connecting to the remote MCP server.**Select how you would like to open your project**Choose `Open in current window`

.

Provide the following information at the prompts:

Prompt Selection **Select a project type**Choose `Python`

.**Select a Python interpreter to create a virtual environment**Choose your preferred Python interpreter. If an option isn't shown, type in the full path to your Python binary. **Select a template for your project's first function**Choose `MCP Tool trigger`

.**Name of the function you want to create**Enter `mcp_trigger`

.**Authorization level**Choose `FUNCTION`

, which requires access key when connecting to the remote MCP server.**Select how you would like to open your project**Choose `Open in current window`

.

Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for an MCP server trigger. You can view the local project files in the Explorer.

## Start the MCP server locally

Function apps need a storage component to run. Before starting the server, start the local storage emulator:

In

*local.setting.json*, ensure you have`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true"`

.In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run the server locally.

To start running locally, press

`F5`.

## Test the server

Find the

`.vscode`

directory and open`mcp.json`

. The editor should add the server's connection info.Start the server by selecting the

**Start**button above server name.When you connect to the server, you see the number of tools available above the server name.

Open Visual Studio Code Copilot chat in agent mode, then ask a question. For example, "Greet with #your-local-server-name". This question ensures Copilot uses the server to help answer the question.

When Copilot requests to run a tool from the local MCP server, select

**Allow**.Disconnect from the server when you finish testing by selecting

**Stop**, and`Cntrl+C`

to stop running it locally.

Tip

In the Copilot chat window, select the tool icon in the bottom to see the list of servers and tools available for the chat. Ensure the local MCP server is checked when testing.

## Remote MCP server authorization

There are two ways to reduce or prevent unauthorized use of your remote MCP server endpoints:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Built-in server authentication (preview) | Functions includes built-in
|

`Anonymous`

access level to disable access keys in your server when using OAuth-based authentication.Note

This tutorial contains detailed configuration instructions for the built-in server authorization and authentication feature, which might also be referred to as *App Service Authentication* in other articles. You can find an overview of the feature and some usage guidance in the [Configure built-in server authorization (preview)](../app-service/configure-authentication-mcp) article.

## Disable key-based authentication

The built-in server authorization feature is a component separate from Azure Functions. When using server authentication, it's best to first disable key-based authentication by allowing anonymous access.

To disable host-based authentication in your MCP server, set `system.webhookAuthorizationLevel`

to `Anonymous`

in the `host.json`

file:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"mcp": {
...
"system": {
"webhookAuthorizationLevel": "Anonymous"
}
}
}
}
```


## Create the function app in Azure

Create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan in Azure that hosts your MCP server.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), from the menu or the**Home**page, select**Create a resource**.Select

**Get started**and then**Create**under**Function App**.Under

**Select a hosting option**, choose**Flex Consumption**>**Select**.On the

**Basics**page, use the function app settings as specified in the following table:Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription in which you create your new function app. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)*myResourceGroup*Name for the new resource group in which you create your function app. **Function App name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z`

(case insensitive),`0-9`

, and`-`

.**Region**Preferred region Select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)that's near you or near other services that your functions can access. Unsupported regions aren't displayed. For more information, see[View currently supported regions](flex-consumption-how-to#view-currently-supported-regions).**Runtime stack**Preferred language Choose one of the supported language runtime stacks. In-portal editing using Visual Studio Code for the Web is currently only available for Node.js, PowerShell, and Python apps. C# class library and Java functions must be [developed locally](functions-develop-local#local-development-environments).**Version**Language version Choose a supported version of your language runtime stack. **Instance size**Default Determines the amount of instance memory allocated for each instance of your app. For more information, see [Instance sizes](flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes).On the

**Storage**page, accept the default behavior of creating a new[default host storage account](storage-considerations)or choose to use an existing storage account.

On the

**Monitoring**page, make sure that**Enable Application Insights**is selected. Accept the default to create a new Application Insights instance, or else choose to use an existing instance. When you create an Application Insights instance, you're also asked to select a Log Analytics**Workspace**.On the

**Authentication**page, change the**Authentication type**to**Managed identity**for all resources. With this option, a user-assigned managed identity is also created that your app uses to access these Azure resources using Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Managed identities with Microsoft Entra ID provides the highest level of security for connecting to Azure resources.Accept the default options in the remaining tabs and then select

**Review + create**to review the app configuration you chose.When you're satisfied, select

**Create**to provision and deploy the function app and related resources.Select the

**Notifications**icon in the upper-right corner of the portal and watch for the**Deployment succeeded**message.Select

**Go to resource**to view your new function app. You can also select**Pin to dashboard**. Pinning makes it easier to return to this function app resource from your dashboard.

## Deploy the MCP server project

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

Python apps also require you to add this app setting:

`PYTHONPATH=/home/site/wwwroot/.python_packages/lib/site-packages`

.

Now you can deploy the server project:

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

When deployment finishes, you should see a notification in Visual Studio Code about connecting to the server. Select the **Connect** button to have the editor set up server connection information in `mcp.json`

.

## Enable built-in server authorization and authentication

The following instruction shows how to enable the built-in authorization and authentication feature on the server app and configures Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider. When done, you test by connecting to the server in Visual Studio Code and see that you're prompted to authenticate before connecting.

### Configure authentication on server app

Open the server app on the Azure portal, and select

**Settings**>**Authentication**from the left menu.Select

**Add identity provider**>**Microsoft**as the identity provider.For

**Choose a tenant for your application and its users**, select**Workforce configuration (current tenant)**.Under

**App registration:**use these settings:Setting Selection **App registration type****Create new app registration****Name**Enter a descriptive name for your app **Client secret expiration****Recommended: 180 days****Supported account types****Current tenant - Single tenant**Under

**Additional checks:**, for**Client application requirement**select**Allow requests from specific client applications**, select the pencil icon, add the Visual Studio Code client ID`aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56`

, and select**OK**. Leave the other sections as they are.Under

**App Service authentication settings**use these settings:Setting Selection **Restrict access****Require authentication****Unauthenticated requests****HTTP 401 Unauthorized: recommended for APIs****Token store**Check the box, which allows token refresh Select

**Add**. After settings propagate, you should see the following result:

### Preauthorize Visual Studio Code as client

Select the name of the Entra app next to

**Microsoft**. This action takes you to the**Overview**of the Entra app resource.On the left menu, find

**Manage -> Expose an API**.Under

**Authorized client applications**, select**+Add a client application**.Enter Visual Studio Code's client ID:

`aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56`

.Select the box in front of the scope that looks like

`api://abcd123-efg456-hijk-7890123/user_impersonation`

.Select

**Add application**.

### Configure protected resource metadata (preview)

In the same

**Expose an API**view, find the**Scopes**section, and copy the scope that allows admins and users to consent to the Entra app. This value looks like`api://abcd123-efg456-hijk-7890123/user_impersonation`

.Run the same command as previous to add the setting

`WEBSITE_AUTH_PRM_DEFAULT_WITH_SCOPES`

:`az functionapp config appsettings set --name <function-app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --settings "WEBSITE_AUTH_PRM_DEFAULT_WITH_SCOPES=<scope>"`

Also in the

**Expose an API**view, find the**Application ID URI**(looks like`api://abcd123-efg456-hijk-7890123`

) on the top and save for later step.

## Connect to server

Open `mcp.json`

inside the `.vscode`

directory.

When you select **Connect** in the pop-up after deployment, Visual Studio Code populates the file with server connection information.

If you miss that step, you can also open **Output** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+U`

) to find the in-line connection button at the end of deployment logs.

You can also manually add connection information:

Get the server domain by running the following command:

`az functionapp show --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --query "defaultHostName" --output tsv`

In Visual Studio Code, open command palette, search for and run the

**MCP: Add Server...**command, and then follow these prompts:Prompt Suggestion Type of server to be added **HTTP**URL of your MCP server `https://<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp`

**Server name****remote-mcp-server**Where to install the server **Workspace**Visual Studio Code opens the

`mcp.json`

setting file for you.

Follow the instructions in the next section to connect to server depending on how you configured the authentication.

### With built-in authentication and authorization

Start the remote server by selecting the

**Start**button above the server name.When prompted about authentication with Microsoft, select

**Allow**, then sign in with your email (the one used to log into Azure portal).When you successfully connect to the server, you see the number of tools available above the server name.

Open Visual Studio Code Copilot chat in agent mode, then ask a question. For example,

`Greet with #your-remote-mcp-server-name`

.Stop server when finish testing.


To understand in detail what happens when Visual Studio Code tries to connect to the remote MCP server, see [Server authorization protocol](#server-authorization-protocol).

### With access key

If you don't enable built-in authentication and authorization and instead want to connect to your MCP server by using an access key, the `mcp.json`

should contain Functions access key in the request headers of a server registration.

Visual Studio automatically populates the access key when you start the server.

The `mcp.json`

file should look like the following example:

```
{
"servers": {
"remote-mcp-server": {
"type": "http",
"url": "https://${input:functionapp-domain}/runtime/webhooks/mcp",
"headers": {
"x-functions-key": "${input:functions-key}"
}
}
},
"inputs": [
{
"type": "promptString",
"id": "functions-key",
"description": "Functions App Key",
"password": true
},
{
"type": "promptString",
"id": "functionapp-domain",
"description": "The domain of the function app.",
"password": false
}
]
}
```


If you want to find the access key yourself, go to the Function app on Azure portal. On the left menu, find **Functions -> App keys**. Under the System keys section, find the one named *mcp_extension*.

Tip

To see connection logs, go to the server name, then select **More** > **Show Output**. For more details on the interaction between the client (Visual Studio Code) and the remote MCP server, select the gear icon and pick **Trace**.


## Configure Azure AI Foundry agent to use your tools

You can configure an [agent on Azure AI Foundry](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/quickstart) to use tools exposed by MCP servers hosted on Azure Functions.

In the Foundry portal, find the agent you want to configure with MCP servers hosted on Functions.

Under

**Tools**, select the**Add**button, then select**+ Add a new tool**.Select the

**Custom**tab, then select**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**and the**Create**button.Fill in the following information:

- Name: Name of the server
- Remote MCP Server endpoint:
- MCP extension server:
`https://<server domain>/runtime/webhooks/mcp`

- Self-hosted server:
`https://<server domain>/mcp`


- MCP extension server:
- Authentication: Choose "Microsoft Entra"
- Type: Choose "Project Managed Identity"
- Audience: This is the Entra App ID URI from
[Configure protected resource metadata](#configure-protected-resource-metadata-preview)

For example:

Select

**Connect**.Test by asking a question that can be answered with the help of a server tool in the chat window.


## Server authorization protocol

In the debug output from Visual Studio Code, you see a series of requests and responses as the MCP client and server interact. When you use the built-in MCP server authorization, you see the following sequence of events:

- The editor sends an initialization request to the MCP server.
- The MCP server responds with an error indicating that authorization is required. The response includes a pointer to the protected resource metadata (PRM) for the application. The built-in authorization feature generates the PRM for the server app.
- The editor fetches the PRM and uses it to identify the authorization server.
- The editor attempts to obtain authorization server metadata (ASM) from a well-known endpoint on the authorization server.
- Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support ASM on the well-known endpoint, so the editor falls back to using the OpenID Connect metadata endpoint to obtain the ASM. It tries to discover this by inserting the well-known endpoint before any other path information.
- The OpenID Connect specifications actually defined the well-known endpoint as being after path information, and that's where Microsoft Entra ID hosts it. So the editor tries again with that format.
- The editor successfully retrieves the ASM. It then uses this information with its own client ID to perform a sign-in. At this point, the editor prompts you to sign in and consent to the application.
- Assuming you successfully sign in and consent, the editor completes the authentication. It repeats the intialization request to the MCP server, this time including an authorization token in the request. This reattempt isn't visible at the Debug output level, but you can see it in the Trace output level.
- The MCP server validates the token and responds with a successful response to the initialization request. The standard MCP flow continues from this point, ultimately resulting in discovery of the MCP tool defined in this sample.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble, ask GitHub Copilot for help. Here are some specific ideas for troubleshooting:

No other ideas at this time. Remember to ask Copilot chat about any errors that occur.

# Tutorial: Deploy a pre-trained image classification model to Azure Functions with PyTorch

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to use Python, PyTorch, and Azure Functions to load a pre-trained model for classifying an image based on its contents. Because you do all work locally and create no Azure resources in the cloud, there's no cost to complete this tutorial.

- Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python.
- Import a pre-trained PyTorch machine learning model into a function app.
- Build a serverless HTTP API for classifying an image as one of 1000 ImageNet
[classes](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). - Consume the API from a web app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). [Python 3.7.4 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). (Python 3.8.x and Python 3.6.x are also verified with Azure Functions.)- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) - A code editor such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Prerequisite check

- In a terminal or command window, run
`func --version`

to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 2.7.1846 or later. - Run
`python --version`

(Linux/macOS) or`py --version`

(Windows) to check your Python version reports 3.7.x.

## Clone the tutorial repository

In a terminal or command window, clone the following repository using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial.git`

Navigate into the folder and examine its contents.

`cd functions-python-pytorch-tutorial`

*start*is your working folder for the tutorial.*end*is the final result and full implementation for your reference.*resources*contains the machine learning model and helper libraries.*frontend*is a website that calls the function app.


## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Navigate to the *start* folder and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

.

```
cd start
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

.)

## Create a local functions project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single boilerplate function named `classify`

that provides an HTTP endpoint. You add more specific code in a later section.

In the

*start*folder, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to initialize a Python function app:`func init --worker-runtime python`

After initialization, the

*start*folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)and[host.json](functions-host-json). Because*local.settings.json*can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the*.gitignore*file.Tip

Because a function project is tied to a specific runtime, all the functions in the project must be written with the same language.

Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the

`--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the`--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger.`func new`

create a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named*function.json*.`func new --name classify --template "HTTP trigger"`

This command creates a folder matching the name of the function,

*classify*. In that folder are two files:*__init__.py*, which contains the function code, and*function.json*, which describes the function's trigger and its input and output bindings. For details on the contents of these files, see[Programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration#programming-model)in the Python developer guide.

## Run the function locally

Start the function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host in the

*start*folder:`func start`

Once you see the

`classify`

endpoint appear in the output, navigate to the URL,`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?name=Azure`

. The message "Hello Azure!" should appear in the output.Use

**Ctrl**-**C**to stop the host.

## Import the PyTorch model and add helper code

To modify the `classify`

function to classify an image based on its contents, you use a pre-trained [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model. The pre-trained model, which comes from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/), classifies an image into 1 of 1000 [ImageNet classes](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). You then add some helper code and dependencies to your project.

In the

*start*folder, run the following command to copy the prediction code and labels into the*classify*folder.`cp ../resources/predict.py classify cp ../resources/labels.txt classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder contains files named*predict.py*and*labels.txt*. If not, check that you ran the command in the*start*folder.Open

*start/requirements.txt*in a text editor and add the dependencies required by the helper code, which should look like:`azure-functions requests -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html torch==1.13.0+cpu torchvision==0.14.0+cpu`

Tip

The versions of torch and torchvision must match values listed in the version table of the

[PyTorch vision repo](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).Save

*requirements.txt*, then run the following command from the*start*folder to install the dependencies.`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`


Installation may take a few minutes, during which time you can proceed with modifying the function in the next section.

Tip

On Windows, you may encounter the error, "Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:" followed by a long pathname to a file like

sharded_mutable_dense_hashtable.cpython-37.pyc. Typically, this error happens because the depth of the folder path becomes too long. In this case, set the registry key`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem@LongPathsEnabled`

to`1`

to enable long paths. Alternately, check where your Python interpreter is installed. If that location has a long path, try reinstalling in a folder with a shorter path.

## Update the function to run predictions

Open

*classify/__init__.py*in a text editor and add the following lines after the existing`import`

statements to import the standard JSON library and the*predict*helpers:`import logging import azure.functions as func import json # Import helper script from .predict import predict_image_from_url`

Replace the entire contents of the

`main`

function with the following code:`def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse: image_url = req.params.get('img') logging.info('Image URL received: ' + image_url) results = predict_image_from_url(image_url) headers = { "Content-type": "application/json", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" } return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(results), headers = headers)`

This function receives an image URL in a query string parameter named

`img`

. It then calls`predict_image_from_url`

from the helper library to download and classify the image using the PyTorch model. The function then returns an HTTP response with the results.Important

Because this HTTP endpoint is called by a web page hosted on another domain, the response includes an

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header to satisfy the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.In a production application, change

`*`

to the web page's specific origin for added security.Save your changes, then assuming that dependencies have finished installing, start the local function host again with

`func start`

. Be sure to run the host in the*start*folder with the virtual environment activated. Otherwise the host will start, but you'll see errors when invoking the function.`func start`

In a browser, open the following URL to invoke the function with the URL of a Bernese Mountain Dog image and confirm that the returned JSON classifies the image as a Bernese Mountain Dog.

`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?img=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/Bernese-Mountain-Dog-Temperament-long.jpg`

Keep the host running because you use it in the next step.


### Run the local web app front end to test the function

To test invoking the function endpoint from another web app, there's a simple app in the repository's *frontend* folder.

Open a new terminal or command prompt and activate the virtual environment (as described earlier under

[Create and activate a Python virtual environment](#create-and-activate-a-python-virtual-environment)).Navigate to the repository's

*frontend*folder.Start an HTTP server with Python:

`python -m http.server`

In a browser, navigate to

`localhost:8000`

, then enter one of the following photo URLs into the textbox, or use the URL of any publicly accessible image.`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/Bernese-Mountain-Dog-Temperament-long.jpg`

`https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/resources/assets/bald-eagle.jpg?raw=true`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/penguin.jpg`


Select

**Submit**to invoke the function endpoint to classify the image.If the browser reports an error when you submit the image URL, check the terminal in which you're running the function app. If you see an error like "No module found 'PIL'", you may have started the function app in the

*start*folder without first activating the virtual environment you created earlier. If you still see errors, run`pip install -r requirements.txt`

again with the virtual environment activated and look for errors.

## Clean up resources

Because the entirety of this tutorial runs locally on your machine, there are no Azure resources or services to clean up.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to build and customize an HTTP API endpoint with Azure Functions to classify images using a PyTorch model. You also learned how to call the API from a web app. You can use the techniques in this tutorial to build out APIs of any complexity, all while running on the serverless compute model provided by Azure Functions.

# Tutorial: Use identity-based connections instead of secrets with triggers and bindings

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to configure Azure Functions to connect to Azure Service Bus queues by using managed identities, instead of secrets stored in the function app settings. The tutorial is a continuation of the [Create a function app without default storage secrets in its definition](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial) tutorial. To learn more about identity-based connections, see [Configure an identity-based connection.](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

While the procedures shown work generally for all languages, this tutorial currently supports C# class library functions on Windows specifically.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create a Service Bus namespace and queue.
- Configure your function app with a managed identity.
- Create a role assignment granting that identity permission to read from the Service Bus queue.
- Create and deploy a function app with a Service Bus trigger.
- Verify your identity-based connection to the Service Bus.

## Prerequisite

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.Complete the previous tutorial:

[Create a function app with identity-based connections](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

## Create a Service Bus namespace and queue

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, search for and select**Service Bus**, and then select**Create**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the Service Bus namespace settings. Use the default values for the remaining options.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription under which your resources are created. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup The resource group you created with your function app. **Namespace name**Globally unique name The namespace of your instance from which to trigger your function. Because the namespace is publicly accessible, you must use a name that is globally unique across Azure. The name must also be between 6 and 50 characters in length, contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes, and can't start with a number. [Location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)myFunctionRegion The region where you created your function app. **Pricing tier**Basic The basic Service Bus tier. Select

**Review + create**. After validation finishes, select**Create**.After deployment completes, select

**Go to resource**.In your new Service Bus namespace, select

**+ Queue**to add a queue.Enter

**myinputqueue**as the new queue's name and select**Create**.

Now that you have a queue, you can add a role assignment to the managed identity of your function app.

## Configure your Service Bus trigger with a managed identity

To use Service Bus triggers with identity-based connections, you need to add the **Azure Service Bus Data Receiver** role assignment to the managed identity in your function app. This role is required when using managed identities to trigger off of your Service Bus namespace. You can also add your own account to this role, which makes it possible to connect to the Service Bus namespace during local testing.

Note

Role requirements for using identity-based connections vary depending on the service and how you are connecting to it. Needs vary across triggers, input bindings, and output bindings. For more information about specific role requirements, see the trigger and binding documentation for the service.

In your Service Bus namespace that you created, select

**Access control (IAM)**. This page is where you can view and configure who has access to the resource.Select

**+ Add**and select**Add role assignment**.Search for

**Azure Service Bus Data Receiver**, select it, and then select**Next**.On the

**Members**tab, under**Assign access to**, choose**Managed Identity**Select

**Select members**to open the**Select managed identities**panel.Confirm that the

**Subscription**is the one in which you created the resources earlier.In the

**Managed identity**selector, choose**Function App**from the**System-assigned managed identity**category. The**Function App**label might have a number in parentheses next to it, indicating the number of apps in the subscription with system-assigned identities.Your app should appear in a list below the input fields. If you don't see it, you can use the

**Select**box to filter the results with your app's name.Select your application. It should move down into the

**Selected members**section. Select**Select**.Back on the

**Add role assignment**screen, select**Review + assign**. Review the configuration, and then select**Review + assign**.

You've granted your function app access to the Service Bus namespace using managed identities.

## Connect to the Service Bus in your function app

In the portal, search for the function app you created in the

[previous tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial), or browse to it in the**Function App**page.In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, select**+ Add**to create a setting. Use the information in the following table to enter the**Name**and**Value**for the new setting:Name Value Description **ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace**<SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE>.servicebus.windows.net This setting connects your function app to the Service Bus using an identity-based connection instead of secrets. Select

**Apply**, and then select**Apply**and**Confirm**to save your changes and restart the app function.

Note

When you use [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator, such as `:`

or `/`

, in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `ServiceBusConnection:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

Now that you've prepared the function app to connect to the Service Bus namespace using a managed identity, you can add a new function that uses a Service Bus trigger to your local project.

## Add a Service Bus triggered function

Run the

`func init`

command, as follows, to create a functions project in a folder named LocalFunctionProj with the specified runtime:`func init LocalFunctionProj --dotnet`

Navigate to the project folder:

`cd LocalFunctionProj`

In the root project folder, run the following command:

`dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus --version 5.2.0`

This command replaces the default version of the Service Bus extension package with a version that supports managed identities.

Run the following command to add a Service Bus triggered function to the project:

`func new --name ServiceBusTrigger --template ServiceBusQueueTrigger`

This command adds the code for a new Service Bus trigger and a reference to the extension package. You need to add a Service Bus namespace connection setting for this trigger.

Open the new

*ServiceBusTrigger.cs*project file and replace the`ServiceBusTrigger`

class with the following code:`public static class ServiceBusTrigger { [FunctionName("ServiceBusTrigger")] public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("myinputqueue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]string myQueueItem, ILogger log) { log.LogInformation($"C# ServiceBus queue trigger function processed message: {myQueueItem}"); } }`

This code sample updates the queue name to

`myinputqueue`

, which is the same name as you queue you created earlier. It also sets the name of the Service Bus connection to`ServiceBusConnection`

. This name is the Service Bus namespace used by the identity-based connection`ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace`

you configured in the portal.

Note

If you try to run your functions now using `func start`

, you'll receive an error. This is because you don't have an identity-based connection defined locally. If you want to run your function locally, set the app setting `ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace`

in `local.settings.json`

as you did in [the previous section](#connect-to-the service-bus-in-your-function-app). In addition, you need to assign the role to your developer identity. For more information, see [local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `ServiceBusConnection:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

## Publish the updated project

Run the following command to locally generate the files needed for the deployment package:

`dotnet publish --configuration Release`

Browse to the

`\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish`

subfolder and create a .zip file from its contents.Publish the .zip file by running the following command, replacing the

`FUNCTION_APP_NAME`

,`RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

, and`PATH_TO_ZIP`

parameters as appropriate:`az functionapp deploy -n FUNCTION_APP_NAME -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --src-path PATH_TO_ZIP`


Now that you've updated the function app with the new trigger, you can verify that it works using the identity.

## Validate your changes

In the portal, search for

`Application Insights`

and select**Application Insights**under**Services**.In

**Application Insights**, browse or search for your named instance.In your instance, select

**Live Metrics**under**Investigate**.Keep the previous tab open, and open the Azure portal in a new tab. In your new tab, navigate to your Service Bus namespace, select

**Queues**from the left menu.Select your queue named

`myinputqueue`

.Select

**Service Bus Explorer**from the left menu.Send a test message.

Select your open

**Live Metrics**tab and see the Service Bus queue execution.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your Service Bus queue trigger with a managed identity.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group:

From the Azure portal menu or home page, select

**Resource groups**>**myResourceGroup**.On the

**myResourceGroup**pane, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**. Type**myResourceGroup**in the text box to confirm, and then select**Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a function app with identity-based connections.

Advance to the next article to learn how to manage identity.

# Azure Service Bus bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus) via [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings). Integrating with Service Bus allows you to build functions that react to and send queue or topic messages.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Run a function when a Service Bus queue or topic message is created |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-service-bus-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.servicebus).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus), version 5.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below.

**Service Bus trigger**

When you want the function to process a single message, the Service Bus trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

When binding to

`ServiceBusReceivedMessage`

, you can optionally also include a parameter of type [ServiceBusMessageActions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/src/ServiceBusMessageActions.cs)1,2to perform[message settlement](../service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#peeklock)actions.When you want the function to process a batch of messages, the Service Bus trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array of events from the batch. Each entry represents one event. When binding to `ServiceBusReceivedMessage[]` , you can optionally also include a parameter of type
1,2 to perform
|

1 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus 5.14.1 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/5.14.1) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

2 When using `ServiceBusMessageActions`

, set the [ AutoCompleteMessages property of the trigger attribute](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger#attributes) to

`false`

. This prevents the runtime from attempting to complete messages after a successful function invocation.**Service Bus output binding**

When you want the function to write a single message, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the message. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing multiple message. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [ServiceBusClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure Service Bus are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for Service Bus Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-servicebus/samples/README.md) to get started with SDK Types for Service Bus in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| ServiceBus trigger |
|

`ServiceBusReceivedMessage`

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding, which depends on the runtime and extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"serviceBus": {
"clientRetryOptions":{
"mode": "exponential",
"tryTimeout": "00:01:00",
"delay": "00:00:00.80",
"maxDelay": "00:01:00",
"maxRetries": 3
},
"prefetchCount": 0,
"transportType": "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy": "https://proxyserver:8080",
"autoCompleteMessages": true,
"maxAutoLockRenewalDuration": "00:05:00",
"maxConcurrentCalls": 16,
"maxConcurrentSessions": 8,
"maxMessageBatchSize": 1000,
"minMessageBatchSize": 1,
"maxBatchWaitTime": "00:00:30",
"sessionIdleTimeout": "00:01:00",
"enableCrossEntityTransactions": false
}
}
}
```


The `clientRetryOptions`

settings only apply to interactions with the Service Bus service. They don't affect retries of function executions. For more information, see [Retries](functions-bindings-error-pages#retries).

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
mode |
`Exponential` |
The approach to use for calculating retry delays. The default exponential mode retries attempts with a delay based on a back-off strategy where each attempt increases the wait duration before retrying. The `Fixed` mode retries attempts at fixed intervals with each delay having a consistent duration. |
tryTimeout |
`00:01:00` |
The maximum duration to wait for an operation per attempt. |
delay |
`00:00:00.80` |
The delay or back-off factor to apply between retry attempts. |
maxDelay |
`00:01:00` |
The maximum delay to allow between retry attempts |
maxRetries |
`3` |
The maximum number of retry attempts before considering the associated operation to have failed. |
prefetchCount |
`0` |
Gets or sets the number of messages that the message receiver can simultaneously request. |
transportType |
amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Service Bus. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
webProxy |
n/a | The proxy to use for communicating with Service Bus over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
autoCompleteMessages |
`true` |
Determines whether or not to automatically complete messages after successful execution of the function. |
maxAutoLockRenewalDuration |
`00:05:00` |
The maximum duration within which the message lock will be renewed automatically. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time and doesn't apply to functions receiving a batch of messages. For batches, the maximum duration is set
|

**maxConcurrentCalls**`16`

`16`

means that the maximum number of concurrent calls per instance is really `32`

(or `2 * 16`

). This setting is used only when the `isSessionsEnabled`

property or attribute on [the trigger](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)is set to`false`

. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time as opposed to in a batch.**maxConcurrentSessions**`8`

`isSessionsEnabled`

property or attribute on [the trigger](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)is set to`true`

. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time.**maxMessageBatchSize**`1000`

**minMessageBatchSize**1`1`

`maxMessageBatchSize`

. The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the

`maxBatchWaitTime`

has elapsed.**maxBatchWaitTime**1`00:00:30`

`minMessageBatchSize`

is larger than 1 and is ignored otherwise. If less than `minMessageBatchSize`

messages were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 50% of the entity message lock duration, meaning the maximum allowed is 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Otherwise, you may get lock exceptions. **NOTE:**This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision.**sessionIdleTimeout****enableCrossEntityTransactions**`false`

1 Using `minMessageBatchSize`

and `maxBatchWaitTime`

requires [v5.10.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus/5.10.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus`

package, or a later version.

# Dapr Extension for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr Extension for Azure Functions is a set of tools and services that allow developers to easily integrate Azure Functions with the [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://docs.dapr.io/) platform.

Azure Functions is an event-driven compute service that provides a set of [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) to easily connect with other Azure services. Dapr provides a set of building blocks and best practices for building distributed applications, including microservices, state management, pub/sub messaging, and more.

With the integration between Dapr and Functions, you can build functions that react to events from Dapr or external systems.

| Action | Direction | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger on a Dapr input binding | N/A |
|

[daprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke)[daprTopicTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-topic)[daprState](functions-bindings-dapr-input-state)[daprSecret](functions-bindings-dapr-input-secret)[daprState](functions-bindings-dapr-output-state)[daprInvoke](functions-bindings-dapr-output-invoke)[daprPublish](functions-bindings-dapr-output-publish)[daprBinding](functions-bindings-dapr-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) or [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) you're using in your function app:

This extension is available by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr), version 1.0.0.

Using the .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
```


## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Dapr enablement

You can configure Dapr using various [arguments and annotations][dapr-args] based on the runtime context. You can configure Dapr for Azure Functions through two channels:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, as in Bicep or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
- The Azure portal

When using an IaC template, specify the following arguments in the `properties`

section of the container app resource definition.

```
DaprConfig: {
enabled: true
appId: '${envResourceNamePrefix}-funcapp'
appPort: 3001
httpReadBufferSize: ''
httpMaxRequestSize: ''
logLevel: ''
enableApiLogging: true
}
```


The above Dapr configuration values are considered application-scope changes. When you run a container app in multiple-revision mode, changes to these settings won't create a new revision. Instead, all existing revisions are restarted to ensure they're configured with the most up-to-date values.

When configuring Dapr using the Azure portal, navigate to your function app and select **Dapr** from the left-side menu:


## Dapr ports and listeners

When you're triggering a function from Dapr, the extension exposes port `3001`

automatically to listen to incoming requests from the Dapr sidecar.

Important

Port `3001`

is only exposed and listened to if a Dapr trigger is defined in the function app. When using Dapr, the sidecar waits to receive a response from the defined port before completing instantiation. *Do not* define the `dapr.io/port`

annotation or `--app-port`

unless you have a trigger. Doing so may lock your application from the Dapr sidecar.

If you're only using input and output bindings, port `3001`

doesn't need to be exposed or defined.

By default, when Azure Functions tries to communicate with Dapr, it calls Dapr over the port resolved from the environment variable `DAPR_HTTP_PORT`

. If that variable is null, it defaults to port `3500`

.

You can override the Dapr address used by input and output bindings by setting the `DaprAddress`

property in the `function.json`

for the binding (or the attribute). By default, it uses `http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}`

.

The function app still exposes another port and endpoint for things like HTTP triggers, which locally defaults to `7071`

, but in a container, defaults to `80`

.

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An in-process class library is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.

The Dapr Extension supports parameter types according to the table below.

| Binding | Parameter types |
|---|---|
| Dapr trigger |
|

[daprState](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/input-bindings.md#state-input-binding)[daprSecret](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/input-bindings.md#state-input-binding)[daprState](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)[daprInvoke](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#service-invocation-output-binding)[daprPublish](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)[daprBinding](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)For examples using these types, see [the GitHub repository for the extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/dotnet-azurefunction).

[Python v1](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/python-azurefunction)[Python v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/python-v2-azurefunction)## Troubleshooting

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that can occur when using the Dapr extension for Azure Functions.

### Ensure Dapr is enabled in your environment

If you're using Dapr bindings and triggers in Azure Functions, and Dapr isn't enabled in your environment, you might receive the error message: `Dapr sidecar isn't present. Please see (https://aka.ms/azure-functions-dapr-sidecar-missing) for more information.`

To enable Dapr in your environment:

If your Azure Function is deployed in Azure Container Apps, refer to

[Dapr enablement instructions for the Dapr extension for Azure Functions](functions-bindings-dapr#dapr-enablement).If your Azure Function is deployed in Kubernetes, verify that your

[deployment's YAML configuration](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/kubernetes-deployment.md#sample-kubernetes-deployment)has the following annotations:`annotations: ... dapr.io/enabled: "true" dapr.io/app-id: "functionapp" # You should only set app-port if you are using a Dapr trigger in your code. dapr.io/app-port: "<DAPR_APP_PORT>" ...`

If you're running your Azure Function locally, run the following command to ensure you're

[running the function app with Dapr](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/python-v2-azurefunction#step-2---run-function-app-with-dapr):`dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port <DAPR_APP_PORT> --components-path <COMPONENTS_PATH> -- func host start`


### Verify app-port value in Dapr configuration

The Dapr extension for Azure Functions starts an HTTP server on port `3001`

by default. You can configure this port using the [ DAPR_APP_PORT environment variable](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/environment/).

If you provide an incorrect app port value when running an Azure Functions app, you might receive the error message: `The Dapr sidecar is configured to listen on port {portInt}, but the app server is running on port {appPort}. This may cause unexpected behavior. For more information, visit [this link](https://aka.ms/azfunc-dapr-app-config-error).`

To resolve this error message:

In your container app's Dapr settings:

If you're using a Dapr trigger in your code, verify that the app port is set to

`3001`

or to the value of the`DAPR_APP_PORT`

environment variable.If you're

*not*using a Dapr trigger in your code, verify that the app port is*not*set. It should be empty.

Verify that you provide the correct app port value in the Dapr configuration.

If you're using Azure Container Apps, specify the app port in Bicep:

`DaprConfig: { ... appPort: <DAPR_APP_PORT> ... }`

If you're using a Kubernetes environment, set the

`dapr.io/app-port`

annotation:`annotations: ... dapr.io/app-port: "<DAPR_APP_PORT>" ...`

If you're developing locally, verify you set

`--app-port`

when running the function app with Dapr:`dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port <DAPR_APP_PORT> --components-path <COMPONENTS_PATH> -- func host start`

# Quickstart: Create and deploy function code to Azure using Visual Studio Code

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

## Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in your preferred language. Later in the article, you update, run, and then publish your function code to Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function). If you want to learn more about security, see [Securing Azure Functions](security-concepts).

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the

them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function). If you want to learn more about security, see [Securing Azure Functions](security-concepts).

# Create a function app in a local Linux container

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Azure Functions Core tools to create your first function in a Linux container on your local computer, verify the function locally, and then publish the containerized function to a container registry. From a container registry, you can easily deploy your containerized functions to Azure.

For a complete example of deploying containerized functions to Azure, which include the steps in this article, see one of the following articles:

[Create your first containerized Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-usage)[Create your first containerized Azure Functions](functions-deploy-container)

You can also create a function app in the Azure portal by using an existing containerized function app from a container registry. For more information, see [Azure portal create using containers](functions-how-to-custom-container#azure-portal-create-using-containers).

## Choose your development language

First, you use Azure Functions tools to create your project code as a function app in a Docker container using a language-specific Linux base image. Make sure to select your language of choice at the top of the article.

Core Tools automatically generates a Dockerfile for your project that uses the most up-to-date version of the correct base image for your functions language. You should regularly update your container from the latest base image and redeploy from the updated version of your container. For more information, see [Creating containerized function apps](functions-how-to-custom-container#creating-containerized-function-apps).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following requirements in place:

Install the

[.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).Install

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.0.5198, or a later version.

- Install
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.

- Install a version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-node#supported-versions).

- Install a version of Python that is
[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions).

- Install the
[.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

Install a version of the

[Java Developer Kit](/en-us/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-jdk-long-term-support)that is[supported by Azure Functions](functions-reference-java#supported-versions).Install

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org)version 3.0 or above.

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version 2.4 or a later version.

If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../guides/developer/azure-developer-guide#understanding-accounts-subscriptions-and-billing), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

To publish the containerized function app image you create to a container registry, you need a Docker ID and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) running on your local computer. If you don't have a Docker ID, you can [create a Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

You also need to complete the [Create a container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal#create-a-container-registry) section of the Container Registry quickstart to create a registry instance. Make a note of your fully qualified login server name.

## Create and activate a virtual environment

In a suitable folder, run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

. Make sure to use one of the [Python versions](functions-reference-python#supported-python-versions) supported by Azure Functions.

```
python -m venv .venv
```


```
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment.

## Create and test the local functions project

In a terminal or command prompt, run the following command for your chosen language to create a function app project in the current folder:

```
func init --worker-runtime dotnet-isolated --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime powershell --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime python --docker
```


```
func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript --docker
```


In an empty folder, run the following command to generate the Functions project from a [Maven archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html):

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.azure -DarchetypeArtifactId=azure-functions-archetype -DjavaVersion=8 -Ddocker
```


The `-DjavaVersion`

parameter tells the Functions runtime which version of Java to use. Use `-DjavaVersion=11`

if you want your functions to run on Java 11. When you don't specify `-DjavaVersion`

, Maven defaults to Java 8. For more information, see [Java versions](functions-reference-java#java-versions).

Important

The `JAVA_HOME`

environment variable must be set to the install location of the correct version of the JDK to complete this article.

Maven asks you for values needed to finish generating the project on deployment. Follow the prompts and provide the following information:

| Prompt | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
groupId |
`com.fabrikam` |
A value that uniquely identifies your project across all projects, following the
|

**artifactId**`fabrikam-functions`

**version**`1.0-SNAPSHOT`

**package**`com.fabrikam.functions`

Type `Y`

or press Enter to confirm.

Maven creates the project files in a new folder named *artifactId*, which in this example is `fabrikam-functions`

.

The `--docker`

option generates a *Dockerfile* for the project, which defines a suitable container for use with Azure Functions and the selected runtime.

Navigate into the project folder:

```
cd fabrikam-functions
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a C# code file in your project.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


Use the following command to add a function to your project, where the `--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the `--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger. `func new`

creates a subfolder matching the function name that contains a configuration file named *function.json*.

```
func new --name HttpExample --template "HTTP trigger"
```


To test the function locally, start the local Azure Functions runtime host in the root of the project folder.

```
func start
```


```
func start
```


```
npm install
npm start
```


```
mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```


After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to that endpoint. You should see a welcome message in the response output.

After you see the `HttpExample`

endpoint written to the output, navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

. The browser must display a "hello" message that echoes back `Functions`

, the value supplied to the `name`

query parameter.

Press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop the host.

## Build the container image and verify locally

(Optional) Examine the *Dockerfile* in the root of the project folder. The *Dockerfile* describes the required environment to run the function app on Linux. The complete list of supported base images for Azure Functions can be found in the [Azure Functions base image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-functions-base).

In the root project folder, run the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command, provide a name as `azurefunctionsimage`

, and tag as `v1.0.0`

. Replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker Hub account ID. This command builds the Docker image for the container.

```
docker build --tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 .
```


When the command completes, you can run the new container locally.

To verify the build, run the image in a local container using the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command, replace `<DOCKER_ID>`

again with your Docker Hub account ID, and add the ports argument as `-p 8080:80`

:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 -it <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0
```


After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample`

, which must display the same greeting message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After the image starts in the local container, browse to `http://localhost:8080/api/HttpExample?name=Functions`

, which must display the same "hello" message as before. Because the HTTP triggered function you created uses anonymous authorization, you can call the function running in the container without having to obtain an access key. For more information, see [authorization keys](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#authorization-keys).

After verifying the function app in the container, press **Ctrl**+**C** (**Command**+**C** on macOS) to stop execution.

## Publish the container image to a registry

To make your container image available for deployment to a hosting environment, you must push it to a container registry. As a security best practice, you should use an Azure Container Registry instance and enforce managed identity-based connections. Docker Hub requires you to authenticate using shared secrets, which make your deployments more vulnerable.

Azure Container Registry is a private registry service for building, storing, and managing container images and related artifacts. You should use a private registry service for publishing your containers to Azure services.

Use this command to sign in to your registry instance using your current Azure credentials:

`az acr login --name <REGISTRY_NAME>`

In the previous command, replace

`<REGISTRY_NAME>`

with the name of your Container Registry instance.Use this command to tag your image with the fully qualified name of your registry login server:

`docker tag <DOCKER_ID>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0 <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

Replace

`<LOGIN_SERVER>`

with the fully qualified name of your registry login server and`<DOCKER_ID>`

with your Docker ID.Use this command to push the container to your registry instance:

`docker push <LOGIN_SERVER>/azurefunctionsimage:v1.0.0`

# Tutorial: Deploy a pre-trained image classification model to Azure Functions with PyTorch

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to use Python, PyTorch, and Azure Functions to load a pre-trained model for classifying an image based on its contents. Because you do all work locally and create no Azure resources in the cloud, there's no cost to complete this tutorial.

- Initialize a local environment for developing Azure Functions in Python.
- Import a pre-trained PyTorch machine learning model into a function app.
- Build a serverless HTTP API for classifying an image as one of 1000 ImageNet
[classes](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). - Consume the API from a web app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). [Python 3.7.4 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/). (Python 3.8.x and Python 3.6.x are also verified with Azure Functions.)- The
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) - A code editor such as
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Prerequisite check

- In a terminal or command window, run
`func --version`

to check that the Azure Functions Core Tools are version 2.7.1846 or later. - Run
`python --version`

(Linux/macOS) or`py --version`

(Windows) to check your Python version reports 3.7.x.

## Clone the tutorial repository

In a terminal or command window, clone the following repository using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial.git`

Navigate into the folder and examine its contents.

`cd functions-python-pytorch-tutorial`

*start*is your working folder for the tutorial.*end*is the final result and full implementation for your reference.*resources*contains the machine learning model and helper libraries.*frontend*is a website that calls the function app.


## Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Navigate to the *start* folder and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `.venv`

.

```
cd start
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


If Python didn't install the venv package on your Linux distribution, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```


You run all subsequent commands in this activated virtual environment. (To exit the virtual environment, run `deactivate`

.)

## Create a local functions project

In Azure Functions, a function project is a container for one or more individual functions that each responds to a specific trigger. All functions in a project share the same local and hosting configurations. In this section, you create a function project that contains a single boilerplate function named `classify`

that provides an HTTP endpoint. You add more specific code in a later section.

In the

*start*folder, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to initialize a Python function app:`func init --worker-runtime python`

After initialization, the

*start*folder contains various files for the project, including configurations files named[local.settings.json](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file)and[host.json](functions-host-json). Because*local.settings.json*can contain secrets downloaded from Azure, the file is excluded from source control by default in the*.gitignore*file.Tip

Because a function project is tied to a specific runtime, all the functions in the project must be written with the same language.

Add a function to your project by using the following command, where the

`--name`

argument is the unique name of your function and the`--template`

argument specifies the function's trigger.`func new`

create a subfolder matching the function name that contains a code file appropriate to the project's chosen language and a configuration file named*function.json*.`func new --name classify --template "HTTP trigger"`

This command creates a folder matching the name of the function,

*classify*. In that folder are two files:*__init__.py*, which contains the function code, and*function.json*, which describes the function's trigger and its input and output bindings. For details on the contents of these files, see[Programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-configuration#programming-model)in the Python developer guide.

## Run the function locally

Start the function by starting the local Azure Functions runtime host in the

*start*folder:`func start`

Once you see the

`classify`

endpoint appear in the output, navigate to the URL,`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?name=Azure`

. The message "Hello Azure!" should appear in the output.Use

**Ctrl**-**C**to stop the host.

## Import the PyTorch model and add helper code

To modify the `classify`

function to classify an image based on its contents, you use a pre-trained [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model. The pre-trained model, which comes from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/), classifies an image into 1 of 1000 [ImageNet classes](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a). You then add some helper code and dependencies to your project.

In the

*start*folder, run the following command to copy the prediction code and labels into the*classify*folder.`cp ../resources/predict.py classify cp ../resources/labels.txt classify`

Verify that the

*classify*folder contains files named*predict.py*and*labels.txt*. If not, check that you ran the command in the*start*folder.Open

*start/requirements.txt*in a text editor and add the dependencies required by the helper code, which should look like:`azure-functions requests -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html torch==1.13.0+cpu torchvision==0.14.0+cpu`

Tip

The versions of torch and torchvision must match values listed in the version table of the

[PyTorch vision repo](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).Save

*requirements.txt*, then run the following command from the*start*folder to install the dependencies.`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`


Installation may take a few minutes, during which time you can proceed with modifying the function in the next section.

Tip

On Windows, you may encounter the error, "Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:" followed by a long pathname to a file like

sharded_mutable_dense_hashtable.cpython-37.pyc. Typically, this error happens because the depth of the folder path becomes too long. In this case, set the registry key`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem@LongPathsEnabled`

to`1`

to enable long paths. Alternately, check where your Python interpreter is installed. If that location has a long path, try reinstalling in a folder with a shorter path.

## Update the function to run predictions

Open

*classify/__init__.py*in a text editor and add the following lines after the existing`import`

statements to import the standard JSON library and the*predict*helpers:`import logging import azure.functions as func import json # Import helper script from .predict import predict_image_from_url`

Replace the entire contents of the

`main`

function with the following code:`def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse: image_url = req.params.get('img') logging.info('Image URL received: ' + image_url) results = predict_image_from_url(image_url) headers = { "Content-type": "application/json", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*" } return func.HttpResponse(json.dumps(results), headers = headers)`

This function receives an image URL in a query string parameter named

`img`

. It then calls`predict_image_from_url`

from the helper library to download and classify the image using the PyTorch model. The function then returns an HTTP response with the results.Important

Because this HTTP endpoint is called by a web page hosted on another domain, the response includes an

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

header to satisfy the browser's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.In a production application, change

`*`

to the web page's specific origin for added security.Save your changes, then assuming that dependencies have finished installing, start the local function host again with

`func start`

. Be sure to run the host in the*start*folder with the virtual environment activated. Otherwise the host will start, but you'll see errors when invoking the function.`func start`

In a browser, open the following URL to invoke the function with the URL of a Bernese Mountain Dog image and confirm that the returned JSON classifies the image as a Bernese Mountain Dog.

`http://localhost:7071/api/classify?img=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/Bernese-Mountain-Dog-Temperament-long.jpg`

Keep the host running because you use it in the next step.


### Run the local web app front end to test the function

To test invoking the function endpoint from another web app, there's a simple app in the repository's *frontend* folder.

Open a new terminal or command prompt and activate the virtual environment (as described earlier under

[Create and activate a Python virtual environment](#create-and-activate-a-python-virtual-environment)).Navigate to the repository's

*frontend*folder.Start an HTTP server with Python:

`python -m http.server`

In a browser, navigate to

`localhost:8000`

, then enter one of the following photo URLs into the textbox, or use the URL of any publicly accessible image.`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/Bernese-Mountain-Dog-Temperament-long.jpg`

`https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/resources/assets/bald-eagle.jpg?raw=true`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/functions-python-pytorch-tutorial/master/resources/assets/penguin.jpg`


Select

**Submit**to invoke the function endpoint to classify the image.If the browser reports an error when you submit the image URL, check the terminal in which you're running the function app. If you see an error like "No module found 'PIL'", you may have started the function app in the

*start*folder without first activating the virtual environment you created earlier. If you still see errors, run`pip install -r requirements.txt`

again with the virtual environment activated and look for errors.

## Clean up resources

Because the entirety of this tutorial runs locally on your machine, there are no Azure resources or services to clean up.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to build and customize an HTTP API endpoint with Azure Functions to classify images using a PyTorch model. You also learned how to call the API from a web app. You can use the techniques in this tutorial to build out APIs of any complexity, all while running on the serverless compute model provided by Azure Functions.

# Tutorial: Use identity-based connections instead of secrets with triggers and bindings

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to configure Azure Functions to connect to Azure Service Bus queues by using managed identities, instead of secrets stored in the function app settings. The tutorial is a continuation of the [Create a function app without default storage secrets in its definition](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial) tutorial. To learn more about identity-based connections, see [Configure an identity-based connection.](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

While the procedures shown work generally for all languages, this tutorial currently supports C# class library functions on Windows specifically.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create a Service Bus namespace and queue.
- Configure your function app with a managed identity.
- Create a role assignment granting that identity permission to read from the Service Bus queue.
- Create and deploy a function app with a Service Bus trigger.
- Verify your identity-based connection to the Service Bus.

## Prerequisite

[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local#v2)version 4.x.Complete the previous tutorial:

[Create a function app with identity-based connections](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

## Create a Service Bus namespace and queue

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, search for and select**Service Bus**, and then select**Create**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the Service Bus namespace settings. Use the default values for the remaining options.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription under which your resources are created. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup The resource group you created with your function app. **Namespace name**Globally unique name The namespace of your instance from which to trigger your function. Because the namespace is publicly accessible, you must use a name that is globally unique across Azure. The name must also be between 6 and 50 characters in length, contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes, and can't start with a number. [Location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)myFunctionRegion The region where you created your function app. **Pricing tier**Basic The basic Service Bus tier. Select

**Review + create**. After validation finishes, select**Create**.After deployment completes, select

**Go to resource**.In your new Service Bus namespace, select

**+ Queue**to add a queue.Enter

**myinputqueue**as the new queue's name and select**Create**.

Now that you have a queue, you can add a role assignment to the managed identity of your function app.

## Configure your Service Bus trigger with a managed identity

To use Service Bus triggers with identity-based connections, you need to add the **Azure Service Bus Data Receiver** role assignment to the managed identity in your function app. This role is required when using managed identities to trigger off of your Service Bus namespace. You can also add your own account to this role, which makes it possible to connect to the Service Bus namespace during local testing.

Note

Role requirements for using identity-based connections vary depending on the service and how you are connecting to it. Needs vary across triggers, input bindings, and output bindings. For more information about specific role requirements, see the trigger and binding documentation for the service.

In your Service Bus namespace that you created, select

**Access control (IAM)**. This page is where you can view and configure who has access to the resource.Select

**+ Add**and select**Add role assignment**.Search for

**Azure Service Bus Data Receiver**, select it, and then select**Next**.On the

**Members**tab, under**Assign access to**, choose**Managed Identity**Select

**Select members**to open the**Select managed identities**panel.Confirm that the

**Subscription**is the one in which you created the resources earlier.In the

**Managed identity**selector, choose**Function App**from the**System-assigned managed identity**category. The**Function App**label might have a number in parentheses next to it, indicating the number of apps in the subscription with system-assigned identities.Your app should appear in a list below the input fields. If you don't see it, you can use the

**Select**box to filter the results with your app's name.Select your application. It should move down into the

**Selected members**section. Select**Select**.Back on the

**Add role assignment**screen, select**Review + assign**. Review the configuration, and then select**Review + assign**.

You've granted your function app access to the Service Bus namespace using managed identities.

## Connect to the Service Bus in your function app

In the portal, search for the function app you created in the

[previous tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial), or browse to it in the**Function App**page.In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, select**+ Add**to create a setting. Use the information in the following table to enter the**Name**and**Value**for the new setting:Name Value Description **ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace**<SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE>.servicebus.windows.net This setting connects your function app to the Service Bus using an identity-based connection instead of secrets. Select

**Apply**, and then select**Apply**and**Confirm**to save your changes and restart the app function.

Note

When you use [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator, such as `:`

or `/`

, in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `ServiceBusConnection:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

Now that you've prepared the function app to connect to the Service Bus namespace using a managed identity, you can add a new function that uses a Service Bus trigger to your local project.

## Add a Service Bus triggered function

Run the

`func init`

command, as follows, to create a functions project in a folder named LocalFunctionProj with the specified runtime:`func init LocalFunctionProj --dotnet`

Navigate to the project folder:

`cd LocalFunctionProj`

In the root project folder, run the following command:

`dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus --version 5.2.0`

This command replaces the default version of the Service Bus extension package with a version that supports managed identities.

Run the following command to add a Service Bus triggered function to the project:

`func new --name ServiceBusTrigger --template ServiceBusQueueTrigger`

This command adds the code for a new Service Bus trigger and a reference to the extension package. You need to add a Service Bus namespace connection setting for this trigger.

Open the new

*ServiceBusTrigger.cs*project file and replace the`ServiceBusTrigger`

class with the following code:`public static class ServiceBusTrigger { [FunctionName("ServiceBusTrigger")] public static void Run([ServiceBusTrigger("myinputqueue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]string myQueueItem, ILogger log) { log.LogInformation($"C# ServiceBus queue trigger function processed message: {myQueueItem}"); } }`

This code sample updates the queue name to

`myinputqueue`

, which is the same name as you queue you created earlier. It also sets the name of the Service Bus connection to`ServiceBusConnection`

. This name is the Service Bus namespace used by the identity-based connection`ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace`

you configured in the portal.

Note

If you try to run your functions now using `func start`

, you'll receive an error. This is because you don't have an identity-based connection defined locally. If you want to run your function locally, set the app setting `ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace`

in `local.settings.json`

as you did in [the previous section](#connect-to-the service-bus-in-your-function-app). In addition, you need to assign the role to your developer identity. For more information, see [local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `ServiceBusConnection:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

## Publish the updated project

Run the following command to locally generate the files needed for the deployment package:

`dotnet publish --configuration Release`

Browse to the

`\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish`

subfolder and create a .zip file from its contents.Publish the .zip file by running the following command, replacing the

`FUNCTION_APP_NAME`

,`RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

, and`PATH_TO_ZIP`

parameters as appropriate:`az functionapp deploy -n FUNCTION_APP_NAME -g RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --src-path PATH_TO_ZIP`


Now that you've updated the function app with the new trigger, you can verify that it works using the identity.

## Validate your changes

In the portal, search for

`Application Insights`

and select**Application Insights**under**Services**.In

**Application Insights**, browse or search for your named instance.In your instance, select

**Live Metrics**under**Investigate**.Keep the previous tab open, and open the Azure portal in a new tab. In your new tab, navigate to your Service Bus namespace, select

**Queues**from the left menu.Select your queue named

`myinputqueue`

.Select

**Service Bus Explorer**from the left menu.Send a test message.

Select your open

**Live Metrics**tab and see the Service Bus queue execution.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your Service Bus queue trigger with a managed identity.

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group:

From the Azure portal menu or home page, select

**Resource groups**>**myResourceGroup**.On the

**myResourceGroup**pane, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**. Type**myResourceGroup**in the text box to confirm, and then select**Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a function app with identity-based connections.

Advance to the next article to learn how to manage identity.

# Azure Service Bus bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions integrates with [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus) via [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings). Integrating with Service Bus allows you to build functions that react to and send queue or topic messages.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Run a function when a Service Bus queue or topic message is created |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-service-bus-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

Add the extension to your project installing this [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.servicebus).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version allows you to bind to types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus), version 5.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below.

**Service Bus trigger**

When you want the function to process a single message, the Service Bus trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

When binding to

`ServiceBusReceivedMessage`

, you can optionally also include a parameter of type [ServiceBusMessageActions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/src/ServiceBusMessageActions.cs)1,2to perform[message settlement](../service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#peeklock)actions.When you want the function to process a batch of messages, the Service Bus trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array of events from the batch. Each entry represents one event. When binding to `ServiceBusReceivedMessage[]` , you can optionally also include a parameter of type
1,2 to perform
|

1 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus 5.14.1 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/5.14.1) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

2 When using `ServiceBusMessageActions`

, set the [ AutoCompleteMessages property of the trigger attribute](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger#attributes) to

`false`

. This prevents the runtime from attempting to complete messages after a successful function invocation.**Service Bus output binding**

When you want the function to write a single message, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the message. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing multiple message. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [ServiceBusClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure Service Bus are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for Service Bus Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-servicebus/samples/README.md) to get started with SDK Types for Service Bus in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| ServiceBus trigger |
|

`ServiceBusReceivedMessage`

## host.json settings

This section describes the configuration settings available for this binding, which depends on the runtime and extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"serviceBus": {
"clientRetryOptions":{
"mode": "exponential",
"tryTimeout": "00:01:00",
"delay": "00:00:00.80",
"maxDelay": "00:01:00",
"maxRetries": 3
},
"prefetchCount": 0,
"transportType": "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy": "https://proxyserver:8080",
"autoCompleteMessages": true,
"maxAutoLockRenewalDuration": "00:05:00",
"maxConcurrentCalls": 16,
"maxConcurrentSessions": 8,
"maxMessageBatchSize": 1000,
"minMessageBatchSize": 1,
"maxBatchWaitTime": "00:00:30",
"sessionIdleTimeout": "00:01:00",
"enableCrossEntityTransactions": false
}
}
}
```


The `clientRetryOptions`

settings only apply to interactions with the Service Bus service. They don't affect retries of function executions. For more information, see [Retries](functions-bindings-error-pages#retries).

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
mode |
`Exponential` |
The approach to use for calculating retry delays. The default exponential mode retries attempts with a delay based on a back-off strategy where each attempt increases the wait duration before retrying. The `Fixed` mode retries attempts at fixed intervals with each delay having a consistent duration. |
tryTimeout |
`00:01:00` |
The maximum duration to wait for an operation per attempt. |
delay |
`00:00:00.80` |
The delay or back-off factor to apply between retry attempts. |
maxDelay |
`00:01:00` |
The maximum delay to allow between retry attempts |
maxRetries |
`3` |
The maximum number of retry attempts before considering the associated operation to have failed. |
prefetchCount |
`0` |
Gets or sets the number of messages that the message receiver can simultaneously request. |
transportType |
amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Service Bus. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
webProxy |
n/a | The proxy to use for communicating with Service Bus over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
autoCompleteMessages |
`true` |
Determines whether or not to automatically complete messages after successful execution of the function. |
maxAutoLockRenewalDuration |
`00:05:00` |
The maximum duration within which the message lock will be renewed automatically. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time and doesn't apply to functions receiving a batch of messages. For batches, the maximum duration is set
|

**maxConcurrentCalls**`16`

`16`

means that the maximum number of concurrent calls per instance is really `32`

(or `2 * 16`

). This setting is used only when the `isSessionsEnabled`

property or attribute on [the trigger](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)is set to`false`

. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time as opposed to in a batch.**maxConcurrentSessions**`8`

`isSessionsEnabled`

property or attribute on [the trigger](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger)is set to`true`

. This setting only applies for functions that receive a single message at a time.**maxMessageBatchSize**`1000`

**minMessageBatchSize**1`1`

`maxMessageBatchSize`

. The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the

`maxBatchWaitTime`

has elapsed.**maxBatchWaitTime**1`00:00:30`

`minMessageBatchSize`

is larger than 1 and is ignored otherwise. If less than `minMessageBatchSize`

messages were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 50% of the entity message lock duration, meaning the maximum allowed is 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Otherwise, you may get lock exceptions. **NOTE:**This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision.**sessionIdleTimeout****enableCrossEntityTransactions**`false`

1 Using `minMessageBatchSize`

and `maxBatchWaitTime`

requires [v5.10.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus/5.10.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus`

package, or a later version.

# Quickstart: Create and deploy function code to Azure using Visual Studio Code

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)for Visual Studio Code.

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

## Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in your preferred language. Later in the article, you update, run, and then publish your function code to Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

## Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in your preferred language. Later in the article, you update, run, and then publish your function code to Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function). If you want to learn more about security, see [Securing Azure Functions](security-concepts).

# Azure Service Bus output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Azure Service Bus output binding to send queue or topic messages.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-service-bus).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This code defines and initializes the `ILogger`

:

```
private readonly ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> _logger;
public ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions(ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
```


This example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that receives a message and writes it to a second queue:

```
[Function(nameof(ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction))]
[ServiceBusOutput("outputQueue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction(
[ServiceBusTrigger("queue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")] ServiceBusReceivedMessage message)
{
_logger.LogInformation("Message ID: {id}", message.MessageId);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Body: {body}", message.Body);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Content-Type: {contentType}", message.ContentType);
var outputMessage = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return outputMessage;
}
```


This example uses an HTTP trigger with an `OutputType`

object to both send an HTTP response and write the output message.

```
[Function("HttpSendMsg")]
public async Task<OutputType> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req, FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# HTTP trigger function processed a request for {context.InvocationId}.");
HttpResponseData response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
await response.WriteStringAsync("HTTP response: Message sent");
return new OutputType()
{
OutputEvent = "MyMessage",
HttpResponse = response
};
}
```


This code defines the multiple output type `OutputType`

, which includes the Service Bus output binding definition on `OutputEvent`

:

```
public class OutputType
{
[ServiceBusOutput("TopicOrQueueName", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string OutputEvent { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that sends a message to a Service Bus queue `myqueue`

when triggered by an HTTP request.

```
@FunctionName("httpToServiceBusQueue")
@ServiceBusQueueOutput(name = "message", queueName = "myqueue", connection = "AzureServiceBusConnection")
public String pushToQueue(
@HttpTrigger(name = "request", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
final String message,
@HttpOutput(name = "response") final OutputBinding<T> result ) {
result.setValue(message + " has been sent.");
return message;
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@QueueOutput`

annotation on function parameters whose value would be written to a Service Bus queue. The parameter type should be `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is any native Java type of a plan old Java object (POJO).

Java functions can also write to a Service Bus topic. The following example uses the `@ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotation to describe the configuration for the output binding.

```
@FunctionName("sbtopicsend")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@ServiceBusTopicOutput(name = "message", topicName = "mytopicname", subscriptionName = "mysubscription", connection = "ServiceBusConnection") OutputBinding<String> message,
final ExecutionContext context) {
String name = request.getBody().orElse("Azure Functions");
message.setValue(name);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
import { app, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const serviceBusOutput = output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: serviceBusOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a Service Bus output binding in a *function.json* file and a [PowerShell function](functions-reference-powershell) that uses the binding.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "serviceBus",
"direction": "out",
"connection": "AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
"name": "outputSbMsg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"topicName": "outtopic"
}
]
}
```


Here's the PowerShell that creates a message as the function's output.

```
param($QueueItem, $TriggerMetadata)
Push-OutputBinding -Name outputSbMsg -Value @{
name = $QueueItem.name
employeeId = $QueueItem.employeeId
address = $QueueItem.address
}
```


The following example demonstrates how to write out to a Service Bus topics and Service Bus queues in Python. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus topic.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_topic_output(arg_name="message",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
topic_name="outTopic")
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, message: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
input_msg = req.params.get('message')
message.set(input_msg)
return 'OK'
```


This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus queue.

```
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_queue_output(
arg_name="msg",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
queue_name="outqueue")
def put_message(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out[str]):
msg.set(req.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
return 'OK'
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the output binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#service-bus-output).

In [C# class libraries](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), use the [ServiceBusOutputAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/src/ServiceBusOutputAttribute.cs) to define the queue or topic written to by the output.

The following table explains the properties you can set using the attribute:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
EntityType |
Sets the entity type as either `Queue` for sending messages to a queue or `Topic` when sending messages to a topic. |
QueueOrTopicName |
Name of the topic or queue to send messages to. Use `EntityType` to set the destination type. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `service_bus_topic_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. |
`queue_name` |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
`topic_name` |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The `ServiceBusQueueOutput`

and `ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotations are available to write a message as a function output. The parameter decorated with these annotations must be declared as an `OutputBinding<T>`

where `T`

is the type corresponding to the message's type.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusQueue()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
queueName |
Name of the queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusTopic()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
topicName |
Name of the topic. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `ServiceBus`

attribute.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `serviceBus` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. Set to "$return" to reference the function return value. |
queueName |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
topicName |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

**accessRights**(v1 only)`manage`

and `listen`

. The default is `manage`

, which indicates that the `connection`

has the **Manage**permission. If you use a connection string that doesn't have the**Manage**permission, set`accessRights`

to "listen". Otherwise, the Functions runtime might fail trying to do operations that require manage rights. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, this property isn't available because the latest version of the Service Bus SDK doesn't support manage operations.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

All C# modalities and extension versions support the following output parameter types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|
Use when the message to write is simple text. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
byte[] |
Use for writing binary data messages. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
Object |
When a message contains JSON, Functions serializes the object into a JSON message payload. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions creates a message with a null object. |

Messaging-specific parameter types contain extra message metadata and aren't compatible with JSON serialization. As a result, it isn't possible to use `ServiceBusMessage`

with the output binding in the isolated model. The specific types supported by the output binding depend on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single message, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the message. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing multiple message. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [ServiceBusClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

In Azure Functions 1.x, the runtime creates the queue if it doesn't exist and you have set `accessRights`

to `manage`

. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, the queue or topic must already exist; if you specify a queue or topic that doesn't exist, the function fails.

Use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

Output to the Service Bus is available via the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet where you pass arguments that match the name designated by binding's name parameter in the *function.json* file.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[str]`

or `func.Out[bytes]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.
Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

For a complete example, see [the examples section](#example).

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Service Bus. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Get the management credentials](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues#get-the-connection-string). The connection string must be for a Service Bus namespace, not limited to a specific queue or topic.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyServiceBus", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyServiceBus". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Service Bus connection string in the app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsServiceBus".

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-service-bus?extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Service Bus namespace. | <service_bus_namespace>.servicebus.windows.net |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You'll need to create a role assignment that provides access to your topics and queues at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Service Bus extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
Trigger1 |
|

[Azure Service Bus Data Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-service-bus-data-sender)1 For triggering from Service Bus topics, the role assignment needs to have effective scope over the Service Bus subscription resource. If only the topic is included, an error will occur. Some clients, such as the Azure portal, don't expose the Service Bus subscription resource as a scope for role assignment. In such cases, the Azure CLI may be used instead. To learn more, see [Azure built-in roles for Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity#resource-scope).

# Azure Event Hubs trigger and bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) bindings for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and output bindings for Event Hubs.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Respond to events sent to an event hub event stream. |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs), version 6.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following options:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs] is in preview.

**Event Hubs trigger**

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Event Hubs output binding**

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure EventHub are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for EventHub Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python) to get started with SDK Types for Event Hubs in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| EventHub trigger |

`EventData`

## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control behavior for the Event Hubs trigger. The configuration is different depending on the extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"eventHubs": {
"maxEventBatchSize" : 100,
"minEventBatchSize" : 25,
"maxWaitTime" : "00:05:00",
"batchCheckpointFrequency" : 1,
"prefetchCount" : 300,
"transportType" : "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy" : "https://proxyserver:8080",
"customEndpointAddress" : "amqps://company.gateway.local",
"targetUnprocessedEventThreshold" : 75,
"initialOffsetOptions" : {
"type" : "fromStart",
"enqueuedTimeUtc" : ""
},
"clientRetryOptions":{
"mode" : "exponential",
"tryTimeout" : "00:01:00",
"delay" : "00:00:00.80",
"maximumDelay" : "00:01:00",
"maximumRetries" : 3
}
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
maxEventBatchSize2 |
100 | The maximum number of events included in a batch for a single invocation. Must be at least 1. |
minEventBatchSize1 |
1 | The minimum number of events desired in a batch. The minimum applies only when the function is receiving multiple events and must be less than `maxEventBatchSize` .The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the `maxWaitTime` has elapsed. Partial batches are also likely for the first invocation of the function after scaling takes place. |
maxWaitTime1 |
00:01:00 | The maximum interval that the trigger should wait to fill a batch before invoking the function. The wait time is only considered when `minEventBatchSize` is larger than 1 and is otherwise ignored. If less than `minEventBatchSize` events were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 10 minutes.NOTE: This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision. When scaling takes place, the first invocation with a partial batch may occur more quickly or may take up to twice the configured wait time. |
| batchCheckpointFrequency | 1 | The number of batches to process before creating a checkpoint for the event hub.NOTE: Setting this value above 1 for hosting plans supported by
|
| prefetchCount | 300 | The number of events that is eagerly requested from Event Hubs and held in a local cache to allow reads to avoid waiting on a network operation |
| transportType | amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Event Hubs. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
| webProxy | null | The proxy to use for communicating with Event Hubs over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
| customEndpointAddress | null | The address to use when establishing a connection to Event Hubs, allowing network requests to be routed through an application gateway or other path needed for the host environment. The fully qualified namespace for the event hub is still needed when a custom endpoint address is used, and it must be specified explicitly or via the connection string. |
targetUnprocessedEventThreshold1 |
null | The desired number of unprocessed events per function instance. The threshold is used in target-based scaling to override the default scaling threshold inferred from the `maxEventBatchSize` option. When set, the total unprocessed event count is divided by this value to determine the number of function instances needed. The instance count is rounded up to a number that creates a balanced partition distribution. |
| initialOffsetOptions/type | fromStart | The location in the event stream to start processing when a checkpoint does not exist in storage. Applies to all partitions. For more information, see the
`fromStart` , `fromEnd` , `fromEnqueuedTime` |

`initialOffsetOptions/type`

is configured as `fromEnqueuedTime`

, this setting is mandatory. Supports time in any format supported by [DateTime.Parse()](/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime), such as`2020-10-26T20:31Z`

. For clarity, you should also specify a timezone. When timezone isn't specified, Functions assumes the local timezone of the machine running the function app, which is UTC when running on Azure.`exponential`

, `fixed`

1 Using `minEventBatchSize`

and `maxWaitTime`

requires [v5.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/5.3.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package, or a later version.

2 The default `maxEventBatchSize`

changed in [v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/6.0.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package. In earlier versions, this was 10.

The `clientRetryOptions`

are used to retry operations between the Functions host and Event Hubs (such as fetching events and sending events). Refer to guidance on [Azure Functions error handling and retries](functions-bindings-error-pages#retries) for information on applying retry policies to individual functions.

For a reference of host.json in Azure Functions 2.x and beyond, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This set of articles explains how to work with Azure Functions bindings for IoT Hub. The IoT Hub support is based on the [Azure Event Hubs Binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Important

While the following code samples use the Event Hub API, the given syntax is applicable for IoT Hub functions.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Respond to events sent to an IoT hub event stream. |

## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs), version 6.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following options:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

# Quickstart: Create and deploy function code to Azure using Visual Studio Code

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Visual Studio Code to create a function that responds to HTTP requests from a template. Use GitHub Copilot to improve the generated function code, verify code updates locally, and then deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Use Visual Studio Code to create a [custom handler](functions-custom-handlers) function that responds to HTTP requests. After verifying the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless Flex Consumption hosting plan in Azure Functions.

Custom handlers can be used to create functions in any language or runtime by running an HTTP server process. This article supports both Go and Rust.

Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

Make sure to select your preferred development language at the top of the article.

## Prerequisites

## Install or update Core Tools

The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core Tools so that you can run and debug your functions locally in Visual Studio Code using the Azure Functions runtime. Before getting started, it's a good idea to install Core Tools locally or update an existing installation to use the latest version.

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette, and then search for and run the command **Azure Functions: Install or Update Core Tools**.

This command tries to either start a package-based installation of the latest version of Core Tools or update an existing package-based installation. If you don't have npm or Homebrew installed on your local computer, you must instead [manually install or update Core Tools](functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools).

## Create your local project

In this section, you use Visual Studio Code to create a local Azure Functions project in your preferred language. Later in the article, you update, run, and then publish your function code to Azure.

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. Search for and run the command`Azure Functions: Create New Project...`

.Using this information, Visual Studio Code generates a code project for Azure Functions with an HTTP trigger function endpoint. You can view the local project files in the Explorer. To learn more about files that are created, see

[Generated project files](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=javascript#generated-project-files).

In the local.settings.json file, update the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

setting as in the following example:`"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

This setting tells the local Functions host to use the storage emulator for the storage connection required by the Python v2 model. When you publish your project to Azure, this setting uses the default storage account instead. If you use an Azure Storage account during local development, set your storage account connection string here.


## Start the emulator

In Visual Studio Code, press

`F1`to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select`Azurite: Start`

.Check the bottom bar and verify that Azurite emulation services are running. If so, you can now run your function locally.


## Create and build your function

The *function.json* file in the *HttpExample* folder declares an HTTP trigger function. You complete the function by adding a handler and compiling it into an executable.

Press

`Ctrl + N`(`Cmd + N`on macOS) to create a new file. Save it as*handler.go*in the function app root (in the same folder as*host.json*).In

*handler.go*, add the following code and save the file. This is your Go custom handler.`package main import ( "fmt" "log" "net/http" "os" ) func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { message := "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string for a personalized response.\n" name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") if name != "" { message = fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.\n", name) } fmt.Fprint(w, message) } func main() { listenAddr := ":8080" if val, ok := os.LookupEnv("FUNCTIONS_CUSTOMHANDLER_PORT"); ok { listenAddr = ":" + val } http.HandleFunc("/api/HttpExample", helloHandler) log.Printf("About to listen on %s. Go to https://127.0.0.1%s/", listenAddr, listenAddr) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)) }`

Press

`Ctrl + Shift + ``or select*New Terminal*from the*Terminal*menu to open a new integrated terminal in VS Code.Compile your custom handler using the following command. An executable file named

`handler`

(`handler.exe`

on Windows) is output in the function app root folder.`go build handler.go`


## Configure your function app

The function host needs to be configured to run your custom handler binary when it starts.

Open

*host.json*.In the

`customHandler.description`

section, set the value of`defaultExecutablePath`

to`handler`

(on Windows, set it to`handler.exe`

).In the

`customHandler`

section, add a property named`enableForwardingHttpRequest`

and set its value to`true`

. For functions consisting of only an HTTP trigger, this setting simplifies programming by allow you to work with a typical HTTP request instead of the custom handler[request payload](functions-custom-handlers#request-payload).Confirm the

`customHandler`

section looks like this example. Save the file.`"customHandler": { "description": { "defaultExecutablePath": "handler", "workingDirectory": "", "arguments": [] }, "enableForwardingHttpRequest": true }`


The function app is configured to start your custom handler executable.

## Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with [Azure Functions Core tools](functions-run-local) to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To start the function locally, press

`F5`or the**Run and Debug**icon in the left-hand side Activity bar. The**Terminal**panel displays the Output from Core Tools. Your app starts in the**Terminal**panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to

**WSL Bash**.With Core Tools still running in

**Terminal**, choose the Azure icon in the activity bar. In the**Workspace**area, expand**Local Project**>**Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or`Ctrl -`click (macOS) the new function and choose**Execute Function Now...**.In

**Enter request body**you see the request message body value of`{ "name": "Azure" }`

. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in

**Terminal**panel.With the

**Terminal**panel focused, press`Ctrl + C`to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, you can optionally use AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, to update template-generated function code.

## Use AI to normalize and validate input

This example prompt for Copilot Chat updates the existing function code to retrieve parameters from either the query string or JSON body. It applies formatting or type conversions and returns the parameters as JSON in the response:

```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Make sure that any added packages are compatible with the version of the packages already in the project
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
```


```
Modify the function to accept name, email, and age from the JSON body of the
request. If any of these parameters are missing from the query string, read
them from the JSON body. Return all three parameters in the JSON response,
applying these rules:
Title-case the name
Lowercase the email
Convert age to an integer if possible, otherwise return "not provided"
Use sensible defaults if any parameter is missing
Update the FunctionTest.java file to test the new logic.
```


You can customize your prompt to add specifics as needed. Then run the app again locally and verify that it works as expected after the code changes. This time, use a message body like:

```
{ "name": "devon torres", "email": "torres.devon@contoso.com", "age": "34" }
```


Tip

GitHub Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible. If you encounter any errors during execution, paste the error message in the chat window, select **Agent** mode, and ask Copilot to help resolve the error. For more information, see [Copilot FAQs](https://aka.ms/copilot-general-use-faqs).

When running in **Agent** mode, the results of this customization depend on the specific tools available to your agent.

When you're satisfied with your app, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

After you verify that the function runs correctly on your local computer, use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

## Sign in to Azure

Before you can create Azure resources or publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

If you aren't already signed in, in the

**Activity bar**, select the Azure icon. Then under**Resources**, select**Sign in to Azure**.If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, select

**Create an Azure Account**. Students can select**Create an Azure for Students Account**.When you are prompted in the browser, select your Azure account and sign in by using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

After you successfully sign in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the side bar.


## Create the function app in Azure

In this section, you create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan along with related resources in your Azure subscription. Many of the resource creation decisions are made for you based on default behaviors. For more control over the created resources, you must instead [create your function app with advanced options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).

In Visual Studio Code, select F1 to open the command palette. At the prompt (

`>`

), enter and then select**Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure**.At the prompts, provide the following information:

Prompt Action **Select subscription**Select the Azure subscription to use. The prompt doesn't appear when you have only one subscription visible under **Resources**.**Enter a new function app name**Enter a globally unique name that's valid in a URL path. The name you enter is validated to make sure that it's unique in Azure Functions. **Select a location for new resources**Select an Azure region. For better performance, select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you. Only regions supported by Flex Consumption plans are displayed.**Select a runtime stack**Select the language version you currently run locally. **Select resource authentication type**Select **Managed identity**, which is the most secure option for connecting to the[default host storage account](storage-considerations#storage-account-guidance).In the

**Azure: Activity Log**panel, the Azure extension shows the status of individual resources as they're created in Azure.When the function app is created, the following related resources are created in your Azure subscription. The resources are named based on the name you entered for your function app.

- A
[resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview), which is a logical container for related resources. - A function app, which provides the environment for executing your function code. A function app lets you group functions as a logical unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources within the same hosting plan.
- An Azure App Service plan, which defines the underlying host for your function app.
- A standard
[Azure Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create), which is used by the Functions host to maintain state and other information about your function app. - An Application Insights instance that's connected to the function app, and which tracks the use of your functions in the app.
- A user-assigned managed identity that's added to the
[Storage Blob Data Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage#storage-blob-data-contributor)role in the new default host storage account.

A notification is displayed after your function app is created and the deployment package is applied.

Tip

By default, the Azure resources required by your function app are created based on the name you enter for your function app. By default, the resources are created with the function app in the same, new resource group. If you want to customize the names of the associated resources or reuse existing resources,

[publish the project with advanced create options](functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=advanced-options#publish-to-azure).- A

## Compile the custom handler for Azure

In this section, you compile your project for deployment to Azure in a function app running Linux. In most cases, you need to recompile your binary and adjust your configuration to match the target platform before publishing it to Azure.

## Deploy the project to Azure

Important

Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.

In the command palette, enter and then select

**Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App**.Select the function app you just created. When prompted about overwriting previous deployments, select

**Deploy**to deploy your function code to the new function app resource.When deployment is completed, select

**View Output**to view the creation and deployment results, including the Azure resources that you created. If you miss the notification, select the bell icon in the lower-right corner to see it again.

## Run the function in Azure

Press

`F1`to display the command palette, then search for and run the command`Azure Functions:Execute Function Now...`

. If prompted, select your subscription.Select your new function app resource and

`HttpExample`

as your function.In

**Enter request body**type`{ "name": "Contoso", "email": "me@contoso.com", "age": "34" }`

, then press Enter to send this request message to your function.When the function executes in Azure, the response is displayed in the notification area. Expand the notification to review the full response.


## Troubleshooting

Use the following table to resolve the most common issues encountered when using this article.

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Can't create a local function project? | Make sure you have the
|

[Azure Functions Core Tools installed](functions-run-local?tabs=node).When running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal shell for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.

## Clean up resources

When you continue to the [next step](#next-steps) and add an Azure Storage queue binding to your function, you'll need to keep all your resources in place to build on what you've already done.

Otherwise, you can use the following steps to delete the function app and its related resources to avoid incurring any further costs.

- In Visual Studio Code, select the Azure icon to open the Azure explorer.
- In the Resource Groups section, find your resource group.
- Right-click the resource group and select
**Delete**.

To learn more about Functions costs, see [Estimating Consumption plan costs](functions-consumption-costs).

## Next steps

You used [Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code) to create a function app with a simple HTTP-triggered function. In the next articles, you expand that function by connecting to either Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Storage. To learn more about connecting to other Azure services, see [Add bindings to an existing function in Azure Functions](add-bindings-existing-function). If you want to learn more about security, see [Securing Azure Functions](security-concepts).

# Azure Service Bus output binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use Azure Service Bus output binding to send queue or topic messages.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-service-bus).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

This code defines and initializes the `ILogger`

:

```
private readonly ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> _logger;
public ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions(ILogger<ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunctions> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
```


This example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that receives a message and writes it to a second queue:

```
[Function(nameof(ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction))]
[ServiceBusOutput("outputQueue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string ServiceBusReceivedMessageFunction(
[ServiceBusTrigger("queue", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")] ServiceBusReceivedMessage message)
{
_logger.LogInformation("Message ID: {id}", message.MessageId);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Body: {body}", message.Body);
_logger.LogInformation("Message Content-Type: {contentType}", message.ContentType);
var outputMessage = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return outputMessage;
}
```


This example uses an HTTP trigger with an `OutputType`

object to both send an HTTP response and write the output message.

```
[Function("HttpSendMsg")]
public async Task<OutputType> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post")] HttpRequestData req, FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation($"C# HTTP trigger function processed a request for {context.InvocationId}.");
HttpResponseData response = req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK);
await response.WriteStringAsync("HTTP response: Message sent");
return new OutputType()
{
OutputEvent = "MyMessage",
HttpResponse = response
};
}
```


This code defines the multiple output type `OutputType`

, which includes the Service Bus output binding definition on `OutputEvent`

:

```
public class OutputType
{
[ServiceBusOutput("TopicOrQueueName", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")]
public string OutputEvent { get; set; }
public HttpResponseData HttpResponse { get; set; }
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that sends a message to a Service Bus queue `myqueue`

when triggered by an HTTP request.

```
@FunctionName("httpToServiceBusQueue")
@ServiceBusQueueOutput(name = "message", queueName = "myqueue", connection = "AzureServiceBusConnection")
public String pushToQueue(
@HttpTrigger(name = "request", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS)
final String message,
@HttpOutput(name = "response") final OutputBinding<T> result ) {
result.setValue(message + " has been sent.");
return message;
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@QueueOutput`

annotation on function parameters whose value would be written to a Service Bus queue. The parameter type should be `OutputBinding<T>`

, where `T`

is any native Java type of a plan old Java object (POJO).

Java functions can also write to a Service Bus topic. The following example uses the `@ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotation to describe the configuration for the output binding.

```
@FunctionName("sbtopicsend")
public HttpResponseMessage run(
@HttpTrigger(name = "req", methods = {HttpMethod.GET, HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.ANONYMOUS) HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
@ServiceBusTopicOutput(name = "message", topicName = "mytopicname", subscriptionName = "mysubscription", connection = "ServiceBusConnection") OutputBinding<String> message,
final ExecutionContext context) {
String name = request.getBody().orElse("Azure Functions");
message.setValue(name);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).body("Hello, " + name).build();
}
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
import { app, InvocationContext, output, Timer } from '@azure/functions';
export async function timerTrigger1(myTimer: Timer, context: InvocationContext): Promise<string> {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
}
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
}),
handler: timerTrigger1,
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a timer triggered [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node) that sends a queue message every 5 minutes.

```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const serviceBusOutput = output.serviceBusQueue({
queueName: 'testqueue',
connection: 'MyServiceBusConnection',
});
app.timer('timerTrigger1', {
schedule: '0 */5 * * * *',
return: serviceBusOutput,
handler: (myTimer, context) => {
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
return `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
},
});
```


To output multiple messages, return an array instead of a single object. For example:

```
const timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();
const message = `Message created at: ${timeStamp}`;
return [`1: ${message}`, `2: ${message}`];
```


The following example shows a Service Bus output binding in a *function.json* file and a [PowerShell function](functions-reference-powershell) that uses the binding.

Here's the binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "serviceBus",
"direction": "out",
"connection": "AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
"name": "outputSbMsg",
"queueName": "outqueue",
"topicName": "outtopic"
}
]
}
```


Here's the PowerShell that creates a message as the function's output.

```
param($QueueItem, $TriggerMetadata)
Push-OutputBinding -Name outputSbMsg -Value @{
name = $QueueItem.name
employeeId = $QueueItem.employeeId
address = $QueueItem.address
}
```


The following example demonstrates how to write out to a Service Bus topics and Service Bus queues in Python. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus topic.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_topic_output(arg_name="message",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
topic_name="outTopic")
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, message: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
input_msg = req.params.get('message')
message.set(input_msg)
return 'OK'
```


This example shows how to write out to a Service Bus queue.

```
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="put_message")
@app.service_bus_queue_output(
arg_name="msg",
connection="AzureServiceBusConnectionString",
queue_name="outqueue")
def put_message(req: func.HttpRequest, msg: func.Out[str]):
msg.set(req.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
return 'OK'
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the output binding. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#service-bus-output).

In [C# class libraries](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), use the [ServiceBusOutputAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/blob/main/extensions/Worker.Extensions.ServiceBus/src/ServiceBusOutputAttribute.cs) to define the queue or topic written to by the output.

The following table explains the properties you can set using the attribute:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
EntityType |
Sets the entity type as either `Queue` for sending messages to a queue or `Topic` when sending messages to a topic. |
QueueOrTopicName |
Name of the topic or queue to send messages to. Use `EntityType` to set the destination type. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `service_bus_topic_output`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. |
`queue_name` |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
`topic_name` |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

The `ServiceBusQueueOutput`

and `ServiceBusTopicOutput`

annotations are available to write a message as a function output. The parameter decorated with these annotations must be declared as an `OutputBinding<T>`

where `T`

is the type corresponding to the message's type.

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusQueue()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
queueName |
Name of the queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.serviceBusTopic()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
topicName |
Name of the topic. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file and the `ServiceBus`

attribute.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `serviceBus` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the queue or topic message in function code. Set to "$return" to reference the function return value. |
queueName |
Name of the queue. Set only if sending queue messages, not for a topic. |
topicName |
Name of the topic. Set only if sending topic messages, not for a queue. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Service Bus. See
|

**accessRights**(v1 only)`manage`

and `listen`

. The default is `manage`

, which indicates that the `connection`

has the **Manage**permission. If you use a connection string that doesn't have the**Manage**permission, set`accessRights`

to "listen". Otherwise, the Functions runtime might fail trying to do operations that require manage rights. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, this property isn't available because the latest version of the Service Bus SDK doesn't support manage operations.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

All C# modalities and extension versions support the following output parameter types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
|
Use when the message to write is simple text. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
byte[] |
Use for writing binary data messages. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions doesn't create a message. |
Object |
When a message contains JSON, Functions serializes the object into a JSON message payload. When the parameter value is null when the function exits, Functions creates a message with a null object. |

Messaging-specific parameter types contain extra message metadata and aren't compatible with JSON serialization. As a result, it isn't possible to use `ServiceBusMessage`

with the output binding in the isolated model. The specific types supported by the output binding depend on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to write a single message, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The message as a string. Use when the message is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the message. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the message. Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple messages, the Service Bus output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single message types |
An array containing multiple message. Each entry represents one message. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [ServiceBusClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus.servicebusclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.servicebus) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

In Azure Functions 1.x, the runtime creates the queue if it doesn't exist and you have set `accessRights`

to `manage`

. In Azure Functions version 2.x and higher, the queue or topic must already exist; if you specify a queue or topic that doesn't exist, the function fails.

Use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

Output to the Service Bus is available via the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet where you pass arguments that match the name designated by binding's name parameter in the *function.json* file.

The output function parameter must be defined as `func.Out[str]`

or `func.Out[bytes]`

. Refer to the [output example](#example) for details.
Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Service Bus SDK](../service-bus-messaging/) rather than the built-in output binding.

For a complete example, see [the examples section](#example).

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Service Bus. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string, follow the steps shown at [Get the management credentials](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-dotnet-get-started-with-queues#get-the-connection-string). The connection string must be for a Service Bus namespace, not limited to a specific queue or topic.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyServiceBus", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyServiceBus". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Service Bus connection string in the app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsServiceBus".

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-service-bus?extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Service Bus namespace. | <service_bus_namespace>.servicebus.windows.net |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You'll need to create a role assignment that provides access to your topics and queues at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Service Bus extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
Trigger1 |
|

[Azure Service Bus Data Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-service-bus-data-sender)1 For triggering from Service Bus topics, the role assignment needs to have effective scope over the Service Bus subscription resource. If only the topic is included, an error will occur. Some clients, such as the Azure portal, don't expose the Service Bus subscription resource as a scope for role assignment. In such cases, the Azure CLI may be used instead. To learn more, see [Azure built-in roles for Azure Service Bus](../service-bus-messaging/service-bus-managed-service-identity#resource-scope).

# Dapr Extension for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr Extension for Azure Functions is a set of tools and services that allow developers to easily integrate Azure Functions with the [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://docs.dapr.io/) platform.

Azure Functions is an event-driven compute service that provides a set of [triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings) to easily connect with other Azure services. Dapr provides a set of building blocks and best practices for building distributed applications, including microservices, state management, pub/sub messaging, and more.

With the integration between Dapr and Functions, you can build functions that react to events from Dapr or external systems.

| Action | Direction | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger on a Dapr input binding | N/A |
|

[daprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke)[daprTopicTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-topic)[daprState](functions-bindings-dapr-input-state)[daprSecret](functions-bindings-dapr-input-secret)[daprState](functions-bindings-dapr-output-state)[daprInvoke](functions-bindings-dapr-output-invoke)[daprPublish](functions-bindings-dapr-output-publish)[daprBinding](functions-bindings-dapr-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) or [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) you're using in your function app:

This extension is available by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr), version 1.0.0.

Using the .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
```


## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Dapr enablement

You can configure Dapr using various [arguments and annotations][dapr-args] based on the runtime context. You can configure Dapr for Azure Functions through two channels:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates, as in Bicep or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
- The Azure portal

When using an IaC template, specify the following arguments in the `properties`

section of the container app resource definition.

```
DaprConfig: {
enabled: true
appId: '${envResourceNamePrefix}-funcapp'
appPort: 3001
httpReadBufferSize: ''
httpMaxRequestSize: ''
logLevel: ''
enableApiLogging: true
}
```


The above Dapr configuration values are considered application-scope changes. When you run a container app in multiple-revision mode, changes to these settings won't create a new revision. Instead, all existing revisions are restarted to ensure they're configured with the most up-to-date values.

When configuring Dapr using the Azure portal, navigate to your function app and select **Dapr** from the left-side menu:


## Dapr ports and listeners

When you're triggering a function from Dapr, the extension exposes port `3001`

automatically to listen to incoming requests from the Dapr sidecar.

Important

Port `3001`

is only exposed and listened to if a Dapr trigger is defined in the function app. When using Dapr, the sidecar waits to receive a response from the defined port before completing instantiation. *Do not* define the `dapr.io/port`

annotation or `--app-port`

unless you have a trigger. Doing so may lock your application from the Dapr sidecar.

If you're only using input and output bindings, port `3001`

doesn't need to be exposed or defined.

By default, when Azure Functions tries to communicate with Dapr, it calls Dapr over the port resolved from the environment variable `DAPR_HTTP_PORT`

. If that variable is null, it defaults to port `3500`

.

You can override the Dapr address used by input and output bindings by setting the `DaprAddress`

property in the `function.json`

for the binding (or the attribute). By default, it uses `http://localhost:{DAPR_HTTP_PORT}`

.

The function app still exposes another port and endpoint for things like HTTP triggers, which locally defaults to `7071`

, but in a container, defaults to `80`

.

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following:

An in-process class library is a compiled C# function runs in the same process as the Functions runtime.

The Dapr Extension supports parameter types according to the table below.

| Binding | Parameter types |
|---|---|
| Dapr trigger |
|

[daprState](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/input-bindings.md#state-input-binding)[daprSecret](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/input-bindings.md#state-input-binding)[daprState](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)[daprInvoke](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#service-invocation-output-binding)[daprPublish](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)[daprBinding](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/docs/output-bindings.md#topic-publish-output-binding)For examples using these types, see [the GitHub repository for the extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/dotnet-azurefunction).

This section describes how to troubleshoot issues that can occur when using the Dapr extension for Azure Functions.

### Ensure Dapr is enabled in your environment

If you're using Dapr bindings and triggers in Azure Functions, and Dapr isn't enabled in your environment, you might receive the error message: `Dapr sidecar isn't present. Please see (https://aka.ms/azure-functions-dapr-sidecar-missing) for more information.`

To enable Dapr in your environment:

If your Azure Function is deployed in Azure Container Apps, refer to

[Dapr enablement instructions for the Dapr extension for Azure Functions](functions-bindings-dapr#dapr-enablement).If your Azure Function is deployed in Kubernetes, verify that your

[deployment's YAML configuration](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/blob/master/deploy/kubernetes/kubernetes-deployment.md#sample-kubernetes-deployment)has the following annotations:`annotations: ... dapr.io/enabled: "true" dapr.io/app-id: "functionapp" # You should only set app-port if you are using a Dapr trigger in your code. dapr.io/app-port: "<DAPR_APP_PORT>" ...`

If you're running your Azure Function locally, run the following command to ensure you're

[running the function app with Dapr](https://github.com/azure/azure-functions-dapr-extension/tree/master/samples/python-v2-azurefunction#step-2---run-function-app-with-dapr):`dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port <DAPR_APP_PORT> --components-path <COMPONENTS_PATH> -- func host start`


### Verify app-port value in Dapr configuration

The Dapr extension for Azure Functions starts an HTTP server on port `3001`

by default. You can configure this port using the [ DAPR_APP_PORT environment variable](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/environment/).

If you provide an incorrect app port value when running an Azure Functions app, you might receive the error message: `The Dapr sidecar is configured to listen on port {portInt}, but the app server is running on port {appPort}. This may cause unexpected behavior. For more information, visit [this link](https://aka.ms/azfunc-dapr-app-config-error).`

To resolve this error message:

In your container app's Dapr settings:

If you're using a Dapr trigger in your code, verify that the app port is set to

`3001`

or to the value of the`DAPR_APP_PORT`

environment variable.If you're

*not*using a Dapr trigger in your code, verify that the app port is*not*set. It should be empty.

Verify that you provide the correct app port value in the Dapr configuration.

If you're using Azure Container Apps, specify the app port in Bicep:

`DaprConfig: { ... appPort: <DAPR_APP_PORT> ... }`

If you're using a Kubernetes environment, set the

`dapr.io/app-port`

annotation:`annotations: ... dapr.io/app-port: "<DAPR_APP_PORT>" ...`

If you're developing locally, verify you set

`--app-port`

when running the function app with Dapr:`dapr run --app-id functionapp --app-port <DAPR_APP_PORT> --components-path <COMPONENTS_PATH> -- func host start`

# Azure Event Hubs trigger and bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) bindings for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and output bindings for Event Hubs.

| Action | Type |
|---|---|
| Respond to events sent to an event hub event stream. |
|

[Output binding](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output)## Install extension

The extension NuGet package you install depends on the C# mode you're using in your function app:

Functions execute in an isolated C# worker process. To learn more, see [Guide for running C# Azure Functions in an isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide).

The functionality of the extension varies depending on the extension version:

This version introduces the ability to [connect using an identity instead of a secret](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection). For a tutorial on configuring your function apps with managed identities, see the [creating a function app with identity-based connections tutorial](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial).

This version supports configuration of triggers and bindings through [.NET Aspire integration](dotnet-aspire-integration#connection-configuration-with-aspire).

Add the extension to your project by installing the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs), version 6.x.

## Install bundle

To be able to use this binding extension in your app, make sure that the *host.json* file in the root of your project contains this `extensionBundle`

reference:

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensionBundle": {
"id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
"version": "[4.0.0, 5.0.0)"
}
}
```


In this example, the `version`

value of `[4.0.0, 5.0.0)`

instructs the Functions host to use a bundle version that is at least `4.0.0`

but less than `5.0.0`

, which includes all potential versions of 4.x. This notation effectively maintains your app on the latest available minor version of the v4.x extension bundle.

When possible, you should use the latest extension bundle major version and allow the runtime to automatically maintain the latest minor version. You can view the contents of the latest bundle on the [extension bundles release page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-extension-bundles/releases/latest). For more information, see [Azure Functions extension bundles](extension-bundles).

## Binding types

The binding types supported for .NET depend on both the extension version and C# execution mode, which can be one of the following options:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see binding type details for the mode and version.

The isolated worker process supports parameter types according to the tables below. Support for binding to types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs] is in preview.

**Event Hubs trigger**

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

**Event Hubs output binding**

When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types |
An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. |

For other output scenarios, create and use an [EventHubProducerClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.producer.eventhubproducerclient) with other types from [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

## SDK Binding Types

SDK Types for Azure EventHub are in Preview. Follow the [Python SDK Bindings for EventHub Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python) to get started with SDK Types for Event Hubs in Python.

Important

Using SDK type bindings requires the [Python v2 programming model](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

| Binding | Parameter types | Samples |
|---|---|---|
| EventHub trigger |
|

`EventData`

## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control behavior for the Event Hubs trigger. The configuration is different depending on the extension version.

```
{
"version": "2.0",
"extensions": {
"eventHubs": {
"maxEventBatchSize" : 100,
"minEventBatchSize" : 25,
"maxWaitTime" : "00:05:00",
"batchCheckpointFrequency" : 1,
"prefetchCount" : 300,
"transportType" : "amqpWebSockets",
"webProxy" : "https://proxyserver:8080",
"customEndpointAddress" : "amqps://company.gateway.local",
"targetUnprocessedEventThreshold" : 75,
"initialOffsetOptions" : {
"type" : "fromStart",
"enqueuedTimeUtc" : ""
},
"clientRetryOptions":{
"mode" : "exponential",
"tryTimeout" : "00:01:00",
"delay" : "00:00:00.80",
"maximumDelay" : "00:01:00",
"maximumRetries" : 3
}
}
}
}
```


| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
maxEventBatchSize2 |
100 | The maximum number of events included in a batch for a single invocation. Must be at least 1. |
minEventBatchSize1 |
1 | The minimum number of events desired in a batch. The minimum applies only when the function is receiving multiple events and must be less than `maxEventBatchSize` .The minimum size isn't strictly guaranteed. A partial batch is dispatched when a full batch can't be prepared before the `maxWaitTime` has elapsed. Partial batches are also likely for the first invocation of the function after scaling takes place. |
maxWaitTime1 |
00:01:00 | The maximum interval that the trigger should wait to fill a batch before invoking the function. The wait time is only considered when `minEventBatchSize` is larger than 1 and is otherwise ignored. If less than `minEventBatchSize` events were available before the wait time elapses, the function is invoked with a partial batch. The longest allowed wait time is 10 minutes.NOTE: This interval is not a strict guarantee for the exact timing on which the function is invoked. There is a small margin of error due to timer precision. When scaling takes place, the first invocation with a partial batch may occur more quickly or may take up to twice the configured wait time. |
| batchCheckpointFrequency | 1 | The number of batches to process before creating a checkpoint for the event hub.NOTE: Setting this value above 1 for hosting plans supported by
|
| prefetchCount | 300 | The number of events that is eagerly requested from Event Hubs and held in a local cache to allow reads to avoid waiting on a network operation |
| transportType | amqpTcp | The protocol and transport that is used for communicating with Event Hubs. Available options: `amqpTcp` , `amqpWebSockets` |
| webProxy | null | The proxy to use for communicating with Event Hubs over web sockets. A proxy cannot be used with the `amqpTcp` transport. |
| customEndpointAddress | null | The address to use when establishing a connection to Event Hubs, allowing network requests to be routed through an application gateway or other path needed for the host environment. The fully qualified namespace for the event hub is still needed when a custom endpoint address is used, and it must be specified explicitly or via the connection string. |
targetUnprocessedEventThreshold1 |
null | The desired number of unprocessed events per function instance. The threshold is used in target-based scaling to override the default scaling threshold inferred from the `maxEventBatchSize` option. When set, the total unprocessed event count is divided by this value to determine the number of function instances needed. The instance count is rounded up to a number that creates a balanced partition distribution. |
| initialOffsetOptions/type | fromStart | The location in the event stream to start processing when a checkpoint does not exist in storage. Applies to all partitions. For more information, see the
`fromStart` , `fromEnd` , `fromEnqueuedTime` |

`initialOffsetOptions/type`

is configured as `fromEnqueuedTime`

, this setting is mandatory. Supports time in any format supported by [DateTime.Parse()](/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/parsing-datetime), such as`2020-10-26T20:31Z`

. For clarity, you should also specify a timezone. When timezone isn't specified, Functions assumes the local timezone of the machine running the function app, which is UTC when running on Azure.`exponential`

, `fixed`

1 Using `minEventBatchSize`

and `maxWaitTime`

requires [v5.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/5.3.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package, or a later version.

2 The default `maxEventBatchSize`

changed in [v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs/6.0.0) of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs`

package. In earlier versions, this was 10.

The `clientRetryOptions`

are used to retry operations between the Functions host and Event Hubs (such as fetching events and sending events). Refer to guidance on [Azure Functions error handling and retries](functions-bindings-error-pages#retries) for information on applying retry policies to individual functions.

For a reference of host.json in Azure Functions 2.x and beyond, see [host.json reference for Azure Functions](functions-host-json).

# Azure Data Explorer output bindings for Azure Functions (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When a function runs, the Azure Data Explorer output binding ingests data to Azure Data Explorer.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer).

## Examples

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

More samples for the Azure Data Explorer output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-outofproc).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to `Product`

class and a corresponding database table:

```
public class Product
{
[JsonProperty(nameof(ProductID))]
public long ProductID { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Name))]
public string Name { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Cost))]
public double Cost { get; set; }
}
```


```
.create-merge table Products (ProductID:long, Name:string, Cost:double)
```


#### HTTP trigger, write one record

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a record to a database. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProduct
{
[Function("AddProduct")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products")]
public static async Task<Product> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductuni")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Product? prod = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Product>();
return prod ?? new Product { };
}
}
}
```


#### HTTP trigger, write records with mapping

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a collection of records to a database. The function uses mapping that transforms a `Product`

to `Item`

.

To transform data from `Product`

to `Item`

, the function uses a mapping reference:

```
.create-merge table Item (ItemID:long, ItemName:string, ItemCost:float)
-- Create a mapping that transforms an Item to a Product
.create-or-alter table Product ingestion json mapping "item_to_product_json" '[{"column":"ProductID","path":"$.ItemID"},{"column":"Name","path":"$.ItemName"},{"column":"Cost","path":"$.ItemCost"}]'
```


```
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common
{
public class Item
{
public long ItemID { get; set; }
public string? ItemName { get; set; }
public double ItemCost { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProductsWithMapping
{
[Function("AddProductsWithMapping")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products", MappingRef = "item_to_product_json")]
public static async Task<Item> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductswithmapping")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Item? item = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Item>();
return item ?? new Item { };
}
}
}
```


More samples for the Java Azure Data Explorer input binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-java).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a `Products`

class (in a separate file `Product.java`

) and a corresponding database table `Products`

(defined earlier):

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
public class Product {
@JsonProperty("ProductID")
public long ProductID;
@JsonProperty("Name")
public String Name;
@JsonProperty("Cost")
public double Cost;
public Product() {
}
public Product(long ProductID, String name, double Cost) {
this.ProductID = ProductID;
this.Name = name;
this.Cost = Cost;
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write a record to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds a product record to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Product`

and `ProductChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>

The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


and Java class in `ProductsChangeLog.java`

:

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;

## Attributes

The [C# library](functions-dotnet-class-library) uses the [KustoAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/src/KustoAttribute.cs) attribute to declare the Azure Data Explorer bindings on the function, which has the following properties.

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
| Database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| Connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| TableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| MappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Annotations

The [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime) uses the [ @KustoInput](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/java-library/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/kusto/annotation/KustoInput.java) annotation (

`com.microsoft.azure.functions.kusto.annotation.KustoOutput`

).| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
| type | Required. Must be set to `kusto` . |
| direction | Required. Must be set to `out` . |
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The attribute's constructor takes the database and the attributes `TableName`

, `MappingRef`

, and `DataFormat`

and the connection setting name. The KQL command can be a KQL statement or a KQL function. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json`

for local development) that contains the [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For example:`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId`

. Queries executed by the input binding are parameterized. The values provided in the KQL parameters are used at runtime.

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to Azure Data Explorer instead of using a connection string, which contains keys. For more information, see [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For mananaged identity-based connections, you must set the `managedServiceIdentity`

property in the binding definition.

# Azure Data Explorer output bindings for Azure Functions (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When a function runs, the Azure Data Explorer output binding ingests data to Azure Data Explorer.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-azure-data-explorer).

## Examples

You can create a C# function by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. An isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on long-term support (LTS) and non-LTS versions for .NET and the .NET Framework.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Azure Functions runtime.[C# script](functions-reference-csharp): Used primarily when you create C# functions in the Azure portal.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

More samples for the Azure Data Explorer output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-outofproc).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to `Product`

class and a corresponding database table:

```
public class Product
{
[JsonProperty(nameof(ProductID))]
public long ProductID { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Name))]
public string Name { get; set; }
[JsonProperty(nameof(Cost))]
public double Cost { get; set; }
}
```


```
.create-merge table Products (ProductID:long, Name:string, Cost:double)
```


#### HTTP trigger, write one record

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a record to a database. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProduct
{
[Function("AddProduct")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products")]
public static async Task<Product> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductuni")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Product? prod = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Product>();
return prod ?? new Product { };
}
}
}
```


#### HTTP trigger, write records with mapping

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library) that adds a collection of records to a database. The function uses mapping that transforms a `Product`

to `Item`

.

To transform data from `Product`

to `Item`

, the function uses a mapping reference:

```
.create-merge table Item (ItemID:long, ItemName:string, ItemCost:float)
-- Create a mapping that transforms an Item to a Product
.create-or-alter table Product ingestion json mapping "item_to_product_json" '[{"column":"ProductID","path":"$.ItemID"},{"column":"Name","path":"$.ItemName"},{"column":"Cost","path":"$.ItemCost"}]'
```


```
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common
{
public class Item
{
public long ItemID { get; set; }
public string? ItemName { get; set; }
public double ItemCost { get; set; }
}
}
```


```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Kusto;
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples.Common;
namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Kusto.SamplesOutOfProc.OutputBindingSamples
{
public static class AddProductsWithMapping
{
[Function("AddProductsWithMapping")]
[KustoOutput(Database: "productsdb", Connection = "KustoConnectionString", TableName = "Products", MappingRef = "item_to_product_json")]
public static async Task<Item> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "addproductswithmapping")]
HttpRequestData req)
{
Item? item = await req.ReadFromJsonAsync<Item>();
return item ?? new Item { };
}
}
}
```


More samples for the Java Azure Data Explorer input binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-java).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a `Products`

class (in a separate file `Product.java`

) and a corresponding database table `Products`

(defined earlier):

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
public class Product {
@JsonProperty("ProductID")
public long ProductID;
@JsonProperty("Name")
public String Name;
@JsonProperty("Cost")
public double Cost;
public Product() {
}
public Product(long ProductID, String name, double Cost) {
this.ProductID = ProductID;
this.Name = name;
this.Cost = Cost;
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write a record to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds a product record to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
<version>2.13.4.1</version>
</dependency>

throws IOException {
if (request.getBody().isPresent()) {
String json = request.getBody().get();
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Product p = mapper.readValue(json, Product.class);
product.setValue(p);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK).header("Content-Type", "application/json").body(product)
.build();
} else {
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT).header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.build();
}
}
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a Java function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Product`

and `ProductChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The function takes another dependency on the [com.fasterxml.jackson.core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON body.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
<version>2.13.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```


The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


and Java class in `ProductsChangeLog.java`

:

```
package com.microsoft.azure.kusto.common;

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to a database table.

The examples refer to the tables `Products`

and `ProductsChangeLog`

(defined earlier).

### HTTP trigger, write records to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a JavaScript function that adds records to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

The following example is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"name": "req",
"direction": "in",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"methods": [
"post"
],
"route": "addproduct"
},
{
"name": "$return",
"type": "http",
"direction": "out"
},
{
"name": "product",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "productsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "Products",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample JavaScript code:

```
// Insert the product, which will insert it into the Products table.
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
// Note that this expects the body to be a JSON object or array of objects which have a property
// matching each of the columns in the table to insert to.
context.bindings.product = req.body;
return {
status: 201,
body: req.body
};
}
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a JavaScript function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Products`

and `ProductsChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings.

The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


The following snippet is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "function",
"name": "req",
"direction": "in",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"methods": [
"post"
],
"route": "addmultitable"
},
{
"name": "res",
"type": "http",
"direction": "out"
},
{
"name": "product",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "productsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "Products",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
},
{
"name": "productchangelog",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "productsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "ProductsChangeLog",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample JavaScript code:

```
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger and Kusto output binding function processed a request.');
context.log(req.body);
if (req.body) {
var changeLog = {ProductID:req.body.ProductID, CreatedAt: new Date().toISOString()};
context.bindings.product = req.body;
context.bindings.productchangelog = changeLog;
context.res = {
body: req.body,
mimetype: "application/json",
status: 201
}
} else {
context.res = {
status: 400,
body: "Error reading request body"
}
}
}
```


More samples for the Azure Data Explorer output binding are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/tree/main/samples/samples-python).

This section contains the following examples:

The examples refer to the tables `Products`

and `ProductsChangeLog`

(defined earlier).

### HTTP trigger, write records to a table

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a Python function that adds records to a table. The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body.

The following snippet is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"scriptFile": "__init__.py",
"bindings": [
{
"authLevel": "Anonymous",
"type": "httpTrigger",
"direction": "in",
"name": "req",
"methods": [
"post"
],
"route": "addproductuni"
},
{
"type": "http",
"direction": "out",
"name": "$return"
},
{
"name": "product",
"type": "kusto",
"database": "sdktestsdb",
"direction": "out",
"tableName": "Products",
"connection": "KustoConnectionString"
}
]
}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following snippet is sample Python code:

```
import azure.functions as func
from Common.product import Product
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, product: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
body = str(req.get_body(),'UTF-8')
product.set(body)
return func.HttpResponse(
body=body,
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


### HTTP trigger, write to two tables

The following example shows an Azure Data Explorer output binding in a *function.json* file and a JavaScript function that adds records to a database in two different tables (`Products`

and `ProductsChangeLog`

). The function uses data provided in an HTTP POST request as a JSON body and multiple output bindings. The second table, `ProductsChangeLog`

, corresponds to the following definition:

```
.create-merge table ProductsChangeLog (ProductID:long, CreatedAt:datetime)
```


The following snippet is binding data in the *function.json* file:

```
{
"scriptFile": "__init__.py",

import azure.functions as func
from Common.product import Product
def main(req: func.HttpRequest, product: func.Out[str],productchangelog: func.Out[str]) -> func.HttpResponse:
body = str(req.get_body(),'UTF-8')
# parse x:
product.set(body)
id = json.loads(body)["ProductID"]
changelog = {
"ProductID": id,
"CreatedAt": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}
productchangelog.set(json.dumps(changelog))
return func.HttpResponse(
body=body,
status_code=201,
mimetype="application/json"
)
```


## Attributes

The [C# library](functions-dotnet-class-library) uses the [KustoAttribute](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/src/KustoAttribute.cs) attribute to declare the Azure Data Explorer bindings on the function, which has the following properties.

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
| Database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| Connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| TableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| MappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Annotations

The [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime) uses the [ @KustoInput](https://github.com/Azure/Webjobs.Extensions.Kusto/blob/main/java-library/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/kusto/annotation/KustoInput.java) annotation (

`com.microsoft.azure.functions.kusto.annotation.KustoOutput`

).| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, which is resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
| type | Required. Must be set to `kusto` . |
| direction | Required. Must be set to `out` . |
| name | Required. The name of the variable that represents the query results in function code. |
| database | Required. The database against which the query must be executed. |
| connection | Required. The name of the variable that holds the connection string, resolved through environment variables or through function app settings. Defaults to look up on the variable `KustoConnectionString` . At runtime, this variable is looked up against the environment. Documentation on the connection string is at
`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId` . |
| tableName | Required. The table to ingest the data into. |
| mappingRef | Optional. Attribute to pass a
|

`multijson/json`

. It can be set to *text*formats supported in the`datasource`

format [enumeration](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-client-reference#enum-datasourceformat). Samples are validated and provided for CSV and JSON formats.When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

The attribute's constructor takes the database and the attributes `TableName`

, `MappingRef`

, and `DataFormat`

and the connection setting name. The KQL command can be a KQL statement or a KQL function. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json`

for local development) that contains the [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For example:`"KustoConnectionString": "Data Source=https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net;Database=your_Database;Fed=True;AppClientId=your_AppId;AppKey=your_AppKey;Authority Id=your_TenantId`

. Queries executed by the input binding are parameterized. The values provided in the KQL parameters are used at runtime.

Important

For optimal security, your function app should use managed identities when connecting to Azure Data Explorer instead of using a connection string, which contains keys. For more information, see [Kusto connection strings](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/connection-strings/kusto). For mananaged identity-based connections, you must set the `managedServiceIdentity`

property in the binding definition.

# Azure Event Hubs trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to work with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-about) trigger for Azure Functions. Azure Functions supports trigger and [output bindings](functions-bindings-event-hubs-output) for Event Hubs.

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-event-hubs).

Use the function trigger to respond to an event sent to an event hub event stream. You need read access to the underlying event hub to set up the trigger. When the function is triggered, the message passed to the function is typed as a string.

Event Hubs scaling decisions for the Consumption and Premium plans are done via Target Based Scaling. For more information, see [Target Based Scaling](functions-target-based-scaling).

For information about how Azure Functions responds to events sent to an event hub event stream using triggers, see [Integrate Event Hubs with serverless functions on Azure](/en-us/azure/architecture/serverless/event-hubs-functions/event-hubs-functions#consuming-events-with-azure-functions).

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

Azure Functions supports two programming models for Python. The way that you define your bindings depends on your chosen programming model.

The Python v2 programming model lets you define bindings using decorators directly in your Python function code. For more information, see the [Python developer guide](functions-reference-python?pivots=python-mode-decorators#programming-model).

This article supports both programming models.

## Example

The following example shows a [C# function](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) that is triggered based on an event hub, where the input message string is written to the logs:

```
{
private readonly ILogger<EventHubsFunction> _logger;
public EventHubsFunction(ILogger<EventHubsFunction> logger)
{
_logger = logger;
}
[Function(nameof(EventHubFunction))]
[FixedDelayRetry(5, "00:00:10")]
[EventHubOutput("dest", Connection = "EventHubConnection")]
public string EventHubFunction(
[EventHubTrigger("src", Connection = "EventHubConnection")] string[] input,
FunctionContext context)
{
_logger.LogInformation("First Event Hubs triggered message: {msg}", input[0]);
var message = $"Output message created at {DateTime.Now}";
return message;
}
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger [TypeScript function](functions-reference-node?tabs=typescript). The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message.

```
import { app, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function eventHubTrigger1(message: unknown, context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log('Event hub function processed message:', message);
context.log('EnqueuedTimeUtc =', context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtc);
context.log('SequenceNumber =', context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumber);
context.log('Offset =', context.triggerMetadata.offset);
}
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'one',
handler: eventHubTrigger1,
});
```


To receive events in a batch, set `cardinality`

to `many`

, as shown in the following example.

```
import { app, InvocationContext } from '@azure/functions';
export async function eventHubTrigger1(messages: unknown[], context: InvocationContext): Promise<void> {
context.log(`Event hub function processed ${messages.length} messages`);
for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
context.log('Event hub message:', messages[i]);
context.log(`EnqueuedTimeUtc = ${context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtcArray[i]}`);
context.log(`SequenceNumber = ${context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumberArray[i]}`);
context.log(`Offset = ${context.triggerMetadata.offsetArray[i]}`);
}
}
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'many',
handler: eventHubTrigger1,
});
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node). The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'one',
handler: (message, context) => {
context.log('Event hub function processed message:', message);
context.log('EnqueuedTimeUtc =', context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtc);
context.log('SequenceNumber =', context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumber);
context.log('Offset =', context.triggerMetadata.offset);
},
});
```


To receive events in a batch, set `cardinality`

to `many`

, as shown in the following example.

```
const { app } = require('@azure/functions');
app.eventHub('eventHubTrigger1', {
connection: 'myEventHubReadConnectionAppSetting',
eventHubName: 'MyEventHub',
cardinality: 'many',
handler: (messages, context) => {
context.log(`Event hub function processed ${messages.length} messages`);
for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
context.log('Event hub message:', messages[i]);
context.log(`EnqueuedTimeUtc = ${context.triggerMetadata.enqueuedTimeUtcArray[i]}`);
context.log(`SequenceNumber = ${context.triggerMetadata.sequenceNumberArray[i]}`);
context.log(`Offset = ${context.triggerMetadata.offsetArray[i]}`);
}
},
});
```


Here's the PowerShell code:

```
param($eventHubMessages, $TriggerMetadata)
Write-Host "PowerShell eventhub trigger function called for message array: $eventHubMessages"
$eventHubMessages | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "Processed message: $_" }
```


This example uses SDK types to directly access the underlying [ EventData](/en-us/python/api/azure-eventhub/azure.eventhub.eventdata) object provided by the Event Hubs trigger:

The function reads the event body and logs it.

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
import azurefunctions.extensions.bindings.eventhub as eh
app = func.FunctionApp(http_auth_level=func.AuthLevel.FUNCTION)
@app.event_hub_message_trigger(
arg_name="event", event_hub_name="EVENTHUB_NAME", connection="EventHubConnection"
)
def eventhub_trigger(event: eh.EventData):
logging.info(
"Python EventHub trigger processed an event %s",
event.body_as_str()
)
```


For examples of using the EventData type, see the [ EventData](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-extensions/blob/dev/azurefunctions-extensions-bindings-eventhub/samples/eventhub_samples_eventdata/function_app.py) samples. For a step-by-step tutorial on how to include SDK-type bindings in your function app, follow the

[Python SDK Bindings for Event Hubs Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-functions-eventhub-sdk-bindings-python).

Note

Known limitations include:

- The
`enqueued_time`

property is not supported. - Batch message support is supported with runtime version 4.1039 or greater.

To learn more, including what other SDK type bindings are supported, see [SDK type bindings](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger binding and a Python function that uses the binding. The function reads [event metadata](#event-metadata) and logs the message. The example depends on whether you use the [v1 or v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python).

```
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="EventHubTrigger1")
@app.event_hub_message_trigger(arg_name="myhub",
event_hub_name="<EVENT_HUB_NAME>",
connection="<CONNECTION_SETTING>")
def test_function(myhub: func.EventHubEvent):
logging.info('Python EventHub trigger processed an event: %s',
myhub.get_body().decode('utf-8'))
```


The following example shows an Event Hubs trigger binding which logs the message body of the Event Hubs trigger.

```
@FunctionName("ehprocessor")
public void eventHubProcessor(
@EventHubTrigger(name = "msg",
eventHubName = "myeventhubname",
connection = "myconnvarname") String message,
final ExecutionContext context )
{
context.getLogger().info(message);
}
```


In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `EventHubTrigger`

annotation on parameters whose value comes from the event hub. Parameters with these annotations cause the function to run when an event arrives. This annotation can be used with native Java types, POJOs, or nullable values using `Optional<T>`

.

The following example illustrates extensive use of `SystemProperties`

and other Binding options for further introspection of the Event along with providing a well-formed `BlobOutput`

path that is Date hierarchical.

```
package com.example;
import java.util.Map;
import java.time.ZonedDateTime;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.*;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.*;
/**
* Azure Functions with Event Hub trigger.
* and Blob Output using date in path along with message partition ID
* and message sequence number from EventHub Trigger Properties
*/
public class EventHubReceiver {
@FunctionName("EventHubReceiver")
@StorageAccount("bloboutput")
public void run(
@EventHubTrigger(name = "message",
eventHubName = "%eventhub%",
consumerGroup = "%consumergroup%",
connection = "eventhubconnection",
cardinality = Cardinality.ONE)
String message,
final ExecutionContext context,
@BindingName("Properties") Map<String, Object> properties,
@BindingName("SystemProperties") Map<String, Object> systemProperties,
@BindingName("PartitionContext") Map<String, Object> partitionContext,
@BindingName("EnqueuedTimeUtc") Object enqueuedTimeUtc,
@BlobOutput(
name = "outputItem",
path = "iotevents/{datetime:yy}/{datetime:MM}/{datetime:dd}/{datetime:HH}/" +
"{datetime:mm}/{PartitionContext.PartitionId}/{SystemProperties.SequenceNumber}.json")
OutputBinding<String> outputItem) {
var et = ZonedDateTime.parse(enqueuedTimeUtc + "Z"); // needed as the UTC time presented does not have a TZ
// indicator
context.getLogger().info("Event hub message received: " + message + ", properties: " + properties);
context.getLogger().info("Properties: " + properties);
context.getLogger().info("System Properties: " + systemProperties);
context.getLogger().info("partitionContext: " + partitionContext);
context.getLogger().info("EnqueuedTimeUtc: " + et);
outputItem.setValue(message);
}
}
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attribute to configure the trigger. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#event-hubs-trigger).

Use the `EventHubTriggerAttribute`

to define a trigger on an event hub, which supports the following properties.

| Parameters | Description |
|---|---|
EventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. Can be referenced in
`%eventHubName%` |

**ConsumerGroup**[consumer group](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)used to subscribe to events in the hub. When omitted, the`$Default`

consumer group is used.**Connection**[Connections](#connections).## Decorators

*Applies only to the Python v2 programming model.*

For Python v2 functions defined using a decorator, the following properties on the `event_hub_message_trigger`

:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
`arg_name` |
The name of the variable that represents the event item in function code. |
`event_hub_name` |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. |
`connection` |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to Event Hubs. See
|

For Python functions defined by using *function.json*, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [EventHubTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhubtrigger) annotation, which supports the following settings:

## Configuration

*Applies only to the Python v1 programming model.*

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `app.eventHub()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
eventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. Can be referenced via
`%eventHubName%` |

**consumerGroup**[consumer group](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)used to subscribe to events in the hub. If omitted, the`$Default`

consumer group is used.**cardinality**`many`

in order to enable batching. If omitted or set to `one`

, a single message is passed to the function.**connection**[Connections](#connections).The following table explains the trigger configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file, which differs by runtime version.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `eventHubTrigger` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `in` . This property is set automatically when you create the trigger in the Azure portal. |
name |
The name of the variable that represents the event item in function code. |
eventHubName |
The name of the event hub. When the event hub name is also present in the connection string, that value overrides this property at runtime. Can be referenced via
`%eventHubName%` |

**consumerGroup**[consumer group](../event-hubs/event-hubs-features#event-consumers)used to subscribe to events in the hub. If omitted, the`$Default`

consumer group is used.**cardinality**`many`

in order to enable batching. If omitted or set to `one`

, a single message is passed to the function.**connection**[Connections](#connections).When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Usage

To learn more about how Event Hubs trigger and IoT Hub trigger scales, see [Consuming Events with Azure Functions](/en-us/azure/architecture/serverless/event-hubs-functions/event-hubs-functions#consuming-events-with-azure-functions).

Functions also supports Python SDK type bindings for Azure Event Hubs, which lets you work with data using these underlying SDK types:

Important

Support for Event Hubs SDK types in Python is in Preview and is only supported for the Python v2 programming model. For more information, see [SDK types in Python](functions-reference-python#sdk-type-bindings).

The parameter type supported by the Event Hubs output binding depends on the Functions runtime version, the extension package version, and the C# modality used.

When you want the function to process a single event, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string` |
The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
`byte[]` |
The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | When an event contains JSON data, Functions tries to deserialize the JSON data into a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type. |
1 |

If you are migrating from any older versions of the Event Hubs SDKs, note that this version drops support for the legacy

`Body`

type in favor of [EventBody](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventdata.eventbody).When you want the function to process a batch of events, the Event Hubs trigger can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`string[]` |
An array of events from the batch, as strings. Each entry represents one event. |
`EventData[]` 1 |
An array of events from the batch, as instances of
|

`T[]`

where `T`

is a JSON serializable type11 To use these types, you need to reference [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs 5.5.0 or later](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.EventHubs/5.5.0) and the [common dependencies for SDK type bindings](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#sdk-types).

The parameter type can be one of the following:

- Any native Java types such as int, String, byte[].
- Nullable values using Optional.
- Any POJO type.

To learn more, see the [EventHubTrigger](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.eventhubtrigger) reference.

The Event Hubs trigger provides several [metadata properties](functions-bindings-expressions-patterns). Metadata properties can be used as part of binding expressions in other bindings or as parameters in your code. The properties come from the [EventData](/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicebus.messaging.eventdata) class.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
`PartitionContext` |
|

`PartitionContext`

instance.`EnqueuedTimeUtc`

`DateTime`

`Offset`

`string`

`PartitionKey`

`string`

`Properties`

`IDictionary<String,Object>`

`SequenceNumber`

`Int64`

`SystemProperties`

`IDictionary<String,Object>`

See [code examples](#example) that use these properties earlier in this article.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration which specifies how the app should connect to Event Hubs. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections).

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

Obtain this connection string by clicking the **Connection Information** button for the [namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace), not the event hub itself. The connection string must be for an Event Hubs namespace, not the event hub itself.

When used for triggers, the connection string must have at least "read" permissions to activate the function. When used for output bindings, the connection string must have "send" permissions to send messages to the event stream.

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

### Identity-based connections

If you are using [version 5.x or higher of the extension](functions-bindings-event-hubs?tabs=extensionv5), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). To do this, you would define settings under a common prefix which maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

In this mode, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully Qualified Namespace | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__fullyQualifiedNamespace` |
The fully qualified Event Hubs namespace. | `myeventhubns.servicebus.windows.net` |

Additional properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

Note

When using [Azure App Configuration](../azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-functions-csharp) or [Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to provide settings for Managed Identity connections, setting names should use a valid key separator such as `:`

or `/`

in place of the `__`

to ensure names are resolved correctly.

For example, `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>:fullyQualifiedNamespace`

.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You will need to create a role assignment that provides access to your event hub at runtime. The scope of the role assignment can be for an Event Hubs namespace, or the event hub itself. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) are not sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Event Hubs extension in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles |
|---|---|
| Trigger |
|

[Azure Event Hubs Data Sender](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-event-hubs-data-sender)## host.json settings

The [host.json](functions-host-json#eventhub) file contains settings that control Event Hubs trigger behavior. See the [host.json settings](functions-bindings-event-hubs#hostjson-settings) section for details regarding available settings.

# Azure Functions with Aspire

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Aspire](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) is an opinionated stack that simplifies development of distributed applications in the cloud. The integration of Aspire with Azure Functions enables you to develop, debug, and orchestrate an Azure Functions .NET project as part of the Aspire app host.

## Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for using Azure Functions with Aspire:

[Install the Aspire Prerequisites](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling#install-aspire-prerequisites).- Full support for the Azure Functions integration requires Aspire 13.1 or later. Aspire 13.0 also includes a preview version of
`Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions`

which acts as a release candidate with go-live support.

- Full support for the Azure Functions integration requires Aspire 13.1 or later. Aspire 13.0 also includes a preview version of
- Install the
[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local).

If you use Visual Studio, update to version 17.12 or later. You must also have the latest version of the Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio. To check for updates:

- Go to
**Tools**>**Options**. - Under
**Projects and Solutions**, select**Azure Functions**. - Select
**Check for updates**and install updates as prompted.

## Solution structure

A solution that uses Azure Functions and Aspire has multiple projects, including an [app host project](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview) and one or more Functions projects.

The app host project is the entry point for your application. It orchestrates the setup of the components of your application, including the Functions project.

The solution typically also includes a *service defaults* project. This project provides a set of default services and configurations to be used across projects in your application.

### App host project

To successfully configure the integration, make sure that the app host project meets the following requirements:

- The app host project must reference
[Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Functions). This package defines the necessary logic for the integration. - The app host project needs to have a project reference for each Functions project that you want to include in the orchestration.
- In the app host's
`AppHost.cs`

file, you must include the project by calling`AddAzureFunctionsProject<TProject>()`

on your`IDistributedApplicationBuilder`

instance. You use this method instead of using the`AddProject<TProject>()`

method that you use for other project types in Aspire. If you use`AddProject<TProject>()`

, the Functions project can't start properly.

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project:

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject");
builder.Build().Run();
```


### Azure Functions project

To successfully configure the integration, make sure that the Azure Functions project meets the following requirements:

The Functions project must reference the

[2.x versions](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#version-2x)of[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker/)and[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Sdk/). You must also update any[Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http.AspNetCore/)references to the 2.x version.Your

`Program.cs`

file must use the`IHostApplicationBuilder`

version of the[host instance startup](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration). This requirement means that you must use`FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`

.If your solution includes a service defaults project, ensure that your Functions project is configured to use it:

- The Functions project should include a project reference to the service defaults project.
- Before you build
`IHostApplicationBuilder`

in`Program.cs`

, include a call to`builder.AddServiceDefaults()`

.


The following example shows a minimal `Program.cs`

file for a Functions project used in Aspire:

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
var builder = FunctionsApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddServiceDefaults();
builder.ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication();
builder.Build().Run();
```


This example doesn't include the default Application Insights configuration that appears in many other `Program.cs`

examples and in the Azure Functions templates. Instead, you configure OpenTelemetry integration in Aspire by calling the `builder.AddServiceDefaults`

method.

To get the most out of the integration, consider the following guidelines:

- Don't include any direct Application Insights integrations in the Functions project. Monitoring in Aspire is instead handled through its OpenTelemetry support. You can configure Aspire to export data to Azure Monitor through the service defaults project.
- Don't define custom app settings in the
`local.settings.json`

file for the Functions project. The only setting that should be in`local.settings.json`

is`"FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"`

. Set all other app configurations through the app host project.

## Connection configuration with Aspire

The app host project defines resources and helps you create connections between them by using code. This section shows how to configure and customize connections that your Azure Functions project uses.

Aspire includes default connection permissions that can help you get started. However, these permissions might not be appropriate or sufficient for your application.

For scenarios that use Azure role-based access control (RBAC), you can customize permissions by calling the `WithRoleAssignments()`

method on the project resource. When you call `WithRoleAssignments()`

, all default role assignments are removed, and you must explicitly define the full set role assignments that you want. If you host your application on Azure Container Apps, using `WithRoleAssignments()`

also requires that you call `AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment()`

on `DistributedApplicationBuilder`

.

### Azure Functions host storage

Azure Functions requires a [host storage connection ( AzureWebJobsStorage)](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity) for several of its core behaviors. When you call

`AddAzureFunctionsProject<TProject>()`

in your app host project, an `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection is created by default and provided to the Functions project. This default connection uses the Azure Storage emulator for local development runs and automatically provisions a storage account when it's deployed. For more control, you can replace this connection by calling `.WithHostStorage()`

on the Functions project resource.The default permissions that Aspire sets for the host storage connection depends on whether you call `WithHostStorage()`

or not. Adding `WithHostStorage()`

removes a [Storage Account Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor) assignment. The following table lists the default permissions that Aspire sets for the host storage connection:

| Host storage connection | Default roles |
|---|---|
No call to `WithHostStorage()` |
|

`WithHostStorage()`

[Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor),[Storage Queue Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-queue-data-contributor),[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that replaces the host storage and specifies a role assignment:

```
using Azure.Provisioning.Storage;
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("myEnv");
var myHostStorage = builder.AddAzureStorage("myHostStorage");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithHostStorage(myHostStorage)
.WithRoleAssignments(myHostStorage, StorageBuiltInRole.StorageBlobDataOwner);
builder.Build().Run();
```


Note

[Storage Blob Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) is the role that we recommend for the [basic needs of the host storage connection](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). Your app might encounter problems if the connection to the blob service has only the Aspire default of [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor).

For production scenarios, include calls to both `WithHostStorage()`

and `WithRoleAssignments()`

. You can then set this role explicitly, along with any others that you need.

### Trigger and binding connections

Your triggers and bindings reference connections by name. The following Aspire integrations provide these connections through a call to `WithReference()`

on the project resource:

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that configures a queue trigger. In this example, the corresponding queue trigger has its `Connection`

property set to `MyQueueTriggerConnection`

, so the call to `WithReference()`

specifies the name.

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var myAppStorage = builder.AddAzureStorage("myAppStorage").RunAsEmulator();
var queues = myAppStorage.AddQueues("queues");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithReference(queues, "MyQueueTriggerConnection");
builder.Build().Run();
```


For other integrations, calls to `WithReference`

set the configuration in a different way. They make the configuration available to [Aspire client integrations](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/integrations-overview#client-integrations), but not to triggers and bindings. For these integrations, call `WithEnvironment()`

to pass the connection information for the trigger or binding to resolve.

The following example shows how to set the environment variable `MyBindingConnection`

for a resource that exposes a connection string expression:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithEnvironment("MyBindingConnection", otherIntegration.Resource.ConnectionStringExpression);
```


If you want both Aspire client integrations and the system of triggers and bindings to use a connection, you can configure both `WithReference()`

and `WithEnvironment()`

.

For some resources, the structure of a connection might be different between when you run it locally and when you publish it to Azure. In the previous example, `otherIntegration`

could be a resource that runs as an emulator, so `ConnectionStringExpression`

would return an emulator connection string. However, when the resource is published, Aspire might set up an identity-based connection, and `ConnectionStringExpression`

would return the service's URI. In this case, to set up [identity-based connections for Azure Functions](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection), you might need to provide a different environment variable name.

The following example uses `builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode`

to conditionally add the necessary suffix:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithEnvironment("MyBindingConnection" + (builder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode ? "__serviceUri" : ""), otherIntegration.Resource.ConnectionStringExpression);
```


For details on the connection formats that each binding supports, and the permissions that those formats require, consult the binding's [reference pages](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

## Hosting the application

Aspire supports two different ways to host your Functions project in Azure:

[Publish as a container app (default)](#publish-as-a-container-app)[Publish as a function app](#publish-as-a-function-app)using preview App Service integration

In both cases, your project is deployed as a container. Aspire takes care of building the container image for you and pushing it to Azure Container Registry.

### Publish as a container app

By default, when you publish an Aspire project to Azure, it's deployed to Azure Container Apps. The system sets up scaling rules for your Functions project using [KEDA](https://keda.sh/). When using Azure Container Apps, additional setup is needed for function keys. See [Access keys on Azure Container Apps](#access-keys-on-azure-container-apps) for more information.

#### Access keys on Azure Container Apps

Several Azure Functions scenarios use access keys to provide a basic mitigation against unwanted access. For example, HTTP trigger functions by default require an access key to be invoked, though this requirement can be disabled using the [ AuthLevel property](functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger#attributes). See

[Work with access keys in Azure Functions](function-keys-how-to)for scenarios which may require a key.

When you deploy a Functions project using Aspire to Azure Container Apps, the system doesn't automatically create or manage Functions access keys. If you need to use access keys, you can manage them as part of your App Host setup. This section shows you how to create an extension method that you can call from your app host's `Program.cs`

file to create and manage access keys. This approach uses Azure Key Vault to store the keys and mounts them into the container app as secrets.

Note

The behavior here relies on the `ContainerApps`

secret provider, which is only available starting with Functions host version `4.1044.0`

. This version is not yet available in all regions, and until it is, when you publish your Aspire project, the base image used for the Functions project may not include the necessary changes.

These steps require Bicep version `0.38.3`

or later. You can check your Bicep version by running `bicep --version`

from a command prompt. If you have the Azure CLI installed, you can use `az bicep upgrade`

to quickly update Bicep to the latest version.

Add the following NuGet packages to your app host project:

Create a new class in your app host project and include the following code:

```
using Aspire.Hosting.Azure;
using Azure.Provisioning.AppContainers;
namespace Aspire.Hosting;
internal static class Extensions
{
private record SecretMapping(string OriginalName, IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference Reference);
public static IResourceBuilder<T> PublishWithContainerAppSecrets<T>(
this IResourceBuilder<T> builder,
IResourceBuilder<AzureKeyVaultResource>? keyVault = null,
string[]? hostKeyNames = null,
string[]? systemKeyExtensionNames = null)
where T : AzureFunctionsProjectResource
{
if (!builder.ApplicationBuilder.ExecutionContext.IsPublishMode)
{
return builder;
}
keyVault ??= builder.ApplicationBuilder.AddAzureKeyVault("functions-keys");
var hostKeysToAdd = (hostKeyNames ?? []).Append("default").Select(k => $"host-function-{k}");
var systemKeysToAdd = systemKeyExtensionNames?.Select(k => $"host-systemKey-{k}_extension") ?? [];
var secrets = hostKeysToAdd.Union(systemKeysToAdd)
.Select(secretName => new SecretMapping(
secretName,
CreateSecretIfNotExists(builder.ApplicationBuilder, keyVault, secretName.Replace("_", "-"))
)).ToList();
return builder
.WithReference(keyVault)
.WithEnvironment("AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType", "ContainerApps")
.PublishAsAzureContainerApp((infra, app) => ConfigureFunctionsContainerApp(infra, app, builder.Resource, secrets));
}
private static void ConfigureFunctionsContainerApp(
AzureResourceInfrastructure infrastructure,
ContainerApp containerApp,
IResource resource,
List<SecretMapping> secrets)
{
const string volumeName = "functions-keys";
const string mountPath = "/run/secrets/functions-keys";
var appIdentityAnnotation = resource.Annotations.OfType<AppIdentityAnnotation>().Last();
var containerAppIdentityId = appIdentityAnnotation.IdentityResource.Id.AsProvisioningParameter(infrastructure);
var containerAppSecretsVolume = new ContainerAppVolume
{
Name = volumeName,
StorageType = ContainerAppStorageType.Secret
};
foreach (var mapping in secrets)
{
var secret = mapping.Reference.AsKeyVaultSecret(infrastructure);
containerApp.Configuration.Secrets.Add(new ContainerAppWritableSecret()
{
Name = mapping.Reference.SecretName.ToLowerInvariant(),
KeyVaultUri = secret.Properties.SecretUri,
Identity = containerAppIdentityId
});
containerAppSecretsVolume.Secrets.Add(new SecretVolumeItem
{
Path = mapping.OriginalName.Replace("-", "."),
SecretRef = mapping.Reference.SecretName.ToLowerInvariant()
});
}
containerApp.Template.Containers[0].Value!.VolumeMounts.Add(new ContainerAppVolumeMount
{
VolumeName = volumeName,
MountPath = mountPath
});
containerApp.Template.Volumes.Add(containerAppSecretsVolume);
}
public static IAzureKeyVaultSecretReference CreateSecretIfNotExists(
IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,
IResourceBuilder<AzureKeyVaultResource> keyVault,
string secretName)
{
var secretParameter = ParameterResourceBuilderExtensions.CreateDefaultPasswordParameter(builder, $"param-{secretName}", special: false);
builder.AddBicepTemplateString($"key-vault-key-{secretName}", """
param location string = resourceGroup().location
param keyVaultName string
param secretName string
@secure()
param secretValue string
// Reference the existing Key Vault
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01' existing = {
name: keyVaultName
}
// Deploy the secret only if it does not already exist
@onlyIfNotExists()
resource newSecret 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2023-07-01' = {
parent: keyVault
name: secretName
properties: {
value: secretValue
}
}
""")
.WithParameter("keyVaultName", keyVault.GetOutput("name"))
.WithParameter("secretName", secretName)
.WithParameter("secretValue", secretParameter);
return keyVault.GetSecret(secretName);
}
}
```


You can then use this method in your app host's `Program.cs`

file:

```
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithHostStorage(storage)
.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
.PublishWithContainerAppSecrets(systemKeyExtensionNames: ["mcp"]);
```


This example uses a default key vault created by the extension method. It results in a default key and a system key for use with the [Model Context Protocol extension](functions-bindings-mcp#connect-to-your-mcp-server).

To use these keys from clients, you need to retrieve them from the key vault.

### Publish as a function app

Note

Publishing as a function app requires the Aspire Azure App Service integration, which is currently in preview.

You can configure Aspire to deploy to a function app using the [Aspire Azure App Service integration](https://aspire.dev/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-functions). Because Aspire publishes the Functions project as a container, the hosting plan for your function app must support deploying containerized applications.

To publish your Aspire Functions project as a function app, follow these steps:

- Add a reference to the
[Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService)NuGet package in your app host project. - In the
`AppHost.cs`

file, call`AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment()`

on your`IDistributedApplicationBuilder`

instance to create an App Service plan. Note that despite the name, this does not provision an App Service Environment resource. - On the Functions project resource, call
`.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()`

. This is required for deploying with the Aspire Azure App Service integration. - On the Functions project resource, call
`.PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, app) => app.Kind = "functionapp,linux")`

to publish that project to the plan.

Important

Make sure that you set the `app.Kind`

property to `"functionapp,linux"`

. This setting ensures the resource is created as a function app, which affects experiences for working with your application.

The following example shows a minimal `AppHost.cs`

file for an app host project that publishes a Functions project as a function app:

```
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("functions-env");
builder.AddAzureFunctionsProject<Projects.MyFunctionsProject>("MyFunctionsProject")
.WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
.PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, app) => app.Kind = "functionapp,linux");
```


This configuration creates a Premium V3 plan. When using a dedicated App Service plan SKU, scaling isn't event-based. Instead, scaling is managed through the App Service plan settings.

## Considerations and best practices

Consider the following points when you're evaluating the integration of Azure Functions with Aspire:

Trigger and binding configuration through Aspire is currently limited to specific integrations. For details, see

[Connection configuration with Aspire](#connection-configuration-with-aspire)in this article.Your function project's

`Program.cs`

file should use the`IHostApplicationBuilder`

version of[host instance startup](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#start-up-and-configuration).`IHostApplicationBuilder`

allows you to call`builder.AddServiceDefaults()`

to add[Aspire service defaults](/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/service-defaults)to your Functions project.Aspire uses OpenTelemetry for monitoring. You can configure Aspire to export data to Azure Monitor through the service defaults project.

In many other Azure Functions contexts, you might include direct integration with Application Insights by registering the worker service. We don't recommend this kind of integration in Aspire. It can lead to runtime errors with version 2.22.0 of

`Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService`

, though version 2.23.0 addresses this problem. When you're using Aspire, remove any direct Application Insights integrations from your Functions project.For Functions projects enlisted into a Aspire orchestration, most of the application configuration should come from the Aspire app host project. Avoid setting things in

`local.settings.json`

, other than the`FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`

setting. If you set the same environment variable in`local.settings.json`

and Aspire, the system uses the Aspire version.Don't configure the Azure Storage emulator for any connections in

`local.settings.json`

. Many Functions starter templates include the emulator as a default for`AzureWebJobsStorage`

. However, emulator configuration can prompt some developer tooling to start a version of the emulator that can conflict with the version that Aspire uses.

# Azure Functions deployment slots

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions deployment slots allow your function app to run different instances called *slots*. Slots are different environments exposed by using a publicly available endpoint. One app instance is always mapped to the production slot, and you can swap instances assigned to a slot on demand.

The number of available slots depends on your specific hosting option:

| Hosting option | Slots (including production) |
|---|---|
|

[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan)[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)[1-20](../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-app-service-limits)[Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview)[Revisions](../container-apps/revisions)The following descriptions reflect how functions are affected by swapping slots:

- Traffic redirection is seamless; no requests are dropped because of a swap. This seamless behavior occurs because the next function trigger is routed to the swapped slot.
- Currently executing function are terminated during the swap. To learn how to write stateless and defensive functions, see
[Improve the performance and reliability of Azure Functions](performance-reliability#write-functions-to-be-stateless).

## Why use slots?

There are many advantages to using deployment slots, including:

**Different environments for different purposes**: Using different slots gives you the opportunity to differentiate app instances before swapping to production or a staging slot.**Prewarming**: Deploying to a slot instead of directly to production allows the app to warm up before going live. Additionally, using slots reduces latency for HTTP-triggered workloads. Instances are warmed up before deployment, which reduces the cold start for newly deployed functions.**Easy fallbacks**: After a swap with production, the slot with a previously staged app now has the previous production app. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can immediately reverse the swap to get your "last known good instance" back.**Minimize restarts**: Changing app settings in a production slot requires a restart of the running app. You can instead change settings in a staging slot and swap the settings change into production with a prewarmed instance. Slots are the recommended way to migrate between Functions runtime versions while maintaining the highest availability. To learn more, see[Minimum downtime update](migrate-version-3-version-4#minimum-downtime-update).

## Swap operations

During a swap, one slot is considered the source and the other is the target. The source slot has the instance of the application that is applied to the target slot. The following steps ensure the target slot doesn't experience downtime during a swap:

**Apply settings:**Settings from the target slot are applied to all instances of the source slot. For example, the production settings are applied to the staging instance. The applied settings include the following categories:[Slot-specific](#manage-settings)app settings and connection strings (if applicable)[Continuous deployment](../app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment)settings (if enabled)[App Service authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)settings (if enabled)

**Wait for restarts and availability:**The swap waits for every instance in the source slot to complete its restart and to be available for requests. If any instance fails to restart, the swap operation reverts all changes to the source slot and stops the operation.**Update routing:**If all instances on the source slot are warmed up successfully, the two slots complete the swap by switching routing rules. After this step, the target slot (for example, the production slot) has the app that was previously warmed up in the source slot.**Repeat operation:**Now that the source slot has the preswap app previously in the target slot, complete the same operation by applying all settings and restarting the instances for the source slot.

Keep in mind the following points:

At any point of the swap operation, initialization of the swapped apps happens on the source slot. The target slot remains online while the source slot is prepared, whether the swap succeeds or fails.

To swap a staging slot with the production slot, make sure that the production slot is

*always*the target slot. This way, the swap operation doesn't affect your production app.Settings related to event sources and bindings must be configured as

[deployment slot settings](#manage-settings)*before you start a swap*. Marking them as "sticky" ahead of time ensures events and outputs are directed to the proper instance.When you create a new staging slot, all existing settings from the production slot are created in the new slot, regardless of the

*stickiness*of the setting.

## Manage settings

Some configuration settings are slot-specific. The following lists detail which settings change when you swap slots, and which remain the same.

**Slot-specific settings**:

- Publishing endpoints
- Custom domain names
- Nonpublic certificates and TLS/SSL settings
- Scale settings
- IP restrictions
- Always On
- Diagnostic settings
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
- Private endpoints

**Non slot-specific settings**:

- General settings, such as framework version, 32/64-bit, web sockets
- App settings (can be configured to stick to a slot)
- Connection strings (can be configured to stick to a slot)
- Handler mappings
- Public certificates
- Hybrid connections *
- Virtual network integration *
- Service endpoints *
- Azure Content Delivery Network *

Features marked with an asterisk (*) don't get swapped, by design.

Note

Certain app settings that apply to unswapped settings are also not swapped. For example, since diagnostic settings aren't swapped, related app settings like `WEBSITE_HTTPLOGGING_RETENTION_DAYS`

and `DIAGNOSTICS_AZUREBLOBRETENTIONDAYS`

are also not swapped, even if they don't show up as slot settings.

### Create a deployment setting

You can mark settings as a deployment setting, which makes it *sticky*. A sticky setting doesn't swap with the app instance.

If you create a deployment setting in one slot, make sure to create the same setting with a unique value in any other slot that is involved in a swap. This way, while a setting's value doesn't change, the setting names remain consistent among slots. This name consistency ensures your code doesn't try to access a setting that is defined in one slot but not another.

Use the following steps to create a deployment setting:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Select

**Configuration**, and then select the setting name you want to stick with the current slot.Select

**Deployment slot setting**, and then select**OK**.Once setting section disappears, select

**Save**to keep the changes

## Deployment

Slots are empty when you create a slot. You can use any of the [supported deployment technologies](functions-deployment-technologies) to deploy your application to a slot.

## Scaling

All slots scale to the same number of workers as the production slot.

- For Consumption plans, the slot scales as the function app scales.
- For App Service plans, the app scales to a fixed number of workers. Slots run on the same number of workers as the app plan.

## View slots

You can view information about existing slots using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to create a new slot in the portal:

Navigate to your function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**and the existing slots are shown.

## Add a slot

You can add a slot using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to create a slot in the portal:

Navigate to your function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**, and then select**+ Add Slot**.Type the name of the slot and select

**Add**.

You can also create a slot by using ARM templates or Bicep files. For an example of how to create a function app in a Consumption plan with a deployment slot, see this [Azure Resource Manager quickstart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-create-dynamic-slot).

## Access slot resources

You access resources (HTTP triggers and administrator endpoints) in a staging slot in the same way as the production slot. However, instead of the function app host name you use the slot-specific host name in the request URL, along with any slot-specific keys. Because staging slots are live apps, you must [secure your functions](security-concepts) in a staging slot as you would in the production slot.

## Swap slots

You can swap slots in an out of production using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to swap a staging slot into production:

Navigate to the function app.

Select

**Deployment slots**, and then select**Swap**.Verify the configuration settings for your swap and select

**Swap**.

The swap operation can take a few seconds.

## Roll back a swap

If a swap results in an error or you simply want to "undo" a swap, you can roll back to the initial state. To return to the preswapped state, do another swap to reverse the swap.

## Remove a slot

You can remove a slot using either the [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure) or through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Use these steps to remove a slot from your app in the portal:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Select

**Delete**.Type the name of the deployment slot you want to delete, and then select

**Delete**.Close the confirmation pane.


## Change App Service plan

With a function app that is running under an App Service plan, you can change the underlying App Service plan for a slot.

Note

You can't change a slot's App Service plan under the Consumption plan.

Use the following steps to change a slot's App Service plan:

Navigate to

**Deployment slots**in the function app, and then select the slot name.Under

**App Service plan**, select**Change App Service plan**.Select the plan you want to upgrade to, or create a new plan.

Select

**OK**.

## Considerations

Azure Functions deployment slots have the following considerations:

- The number of slots available to an app depends on the plan. The Consumption plan is only allowed one deployment slot. More slots are available for apps running under other plans. For details, see
[Service limits](functions-scale#service-limits). - Swapping a slot resets keys for apps that have an
`AzureWebJobsSecretStorageType`

app setting equal to`files`

. - When slots are enabled, your function app is set to read-only mode in the portal.
- Slot swaps might fail when your function app is using a
[secured storage account](configure-networking-how-to)as its default storage account (set in`AzureWebJobsStorage`

). For more information, see thereference.`WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_STICKY_DIAGNOSTICS_SETTINGS`

- Use function app names shorter than 32 characters. Names longer than 32 characters are at risk of causing
[host ID collisions](storage-considerations#host-id-considerations).

# Dapr Service Invocation trigger for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions can be triggered on a Dapr service invocation using the following Dapr events.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("CreateNewOrder")]
public static void Run(
[DaprServiceInvocationTrigger] JObject payload,
[DaprState("%StateStoreName%", Key = "order")] out JToken order,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.");
// payload must be of the format { "data": { "value": "some value" } }
order = payload["data"];
}
```


Here's the Java code for the Dapr Service Invocation trigger:

```
@FunctionName("CreateNewOrder")
public String run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "CreateNewOrder")
)
```


Use the `app`

object to register the `daprInvokeOutput`

:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('InvokeOutputBinding', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'httpTrigger',
authLevel: 'anonymous',
methods: ['POST'],
route: "invoke/{appId}/{methodName}",
name: "req"
}),
return: daprInvokeOutput,
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
const payload = await request.text();
context.log(JSON.stringify(payload));
return { body: payload };
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"type": "daprServiceInvocationTrigger",
"name": "payload",
"direction": "in"
}
]
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload
)
# C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Payload must be of the format { "data": { "value": "some value" } }
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $payload| ConvertTo-Json
# Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'.
Push-OutputBinding -Name order -Value $payload["data"]
```


The following example shows a Dapr Service Invocation trigger, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_state_input(arg_name="data", state_store="statestore", key="order")
def main(payload, data: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveOrder --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.')
logging.info(data)
```


## Attributes

# Dapr State input binding for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Dapr state input binding allows you to read Dapr state during a function execution.

For information on setup and configuration details of the Dapr extension, see the [Dapr extension overview](functions-bindings-dapr).

## Example

A C# function can be created using one of the following C# modes:

| Execution model | Description |
|---|---|
Isolated worker model |
Your function code runs in a separate .NET worker process. Use with
|

**In-process model**[Long Term Support (LTS) versions of .NET](functions-dotnet-class-library#supported-versions). To learn more, see[Develop C# class library functions using Azure Functions](functions-dotnet-class-library).```
[FunctionName("StateInputBinding")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = "state/{key}")] HttpRequest req,
[DaprState("statestore", Key = "{key}")] string state,
ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
return new OkObjectResult(state);
}
```


The following example creates a `"RetrieveOrder"`

function using the `DaprStateInput`

binding with the [ DaprServiceInvocationTrigger](functions-bindings-dapr-trigger-svc-invoke):

```
@FunctionName("RetrieveOrder")
public String run(
@DaprServiceInvocationTrigger(
methodName = "RetrieveOrder")
String payload,
@DaprStateInput(
stateStore = "%StateStoreName%",
key = "order")
String product,
final ExecutionContext context)
```


In the following example, the Dapr invoke input binding is added as an `extraInput`

and paired with an HTTP trigger, which is registered by the `app`

object:

```
const { app, trigger } = require('@azure/functions');
app.generic('StateInputBinding', {
trigger: trigger.generic({
type: 'httpTrigger',
authLevel: 'anonymous',
methods: ['GET'],
route: "state/{key}",
name: "req"
}),
extraInputs: [daprStateInput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
context.log("Node HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
const daprStateInputValue = context.extraInputs.get(daprStateInput);
// print the fetched state value
context.log(daprStateInputValue);
return daprStateInputValue;
}
});
```


The following examples show Dapr triggers in a *function.json* file and PowerShell code that uses those bindings.

Here's the *function.json* file for `daprState`

:

```
{
"bindings":
{
"type": "daprState",
"direction": "in",
"key": "order",
"stateStore": "%StateStoreName%",
"name": "order"
}
}
```


For more information about *function.json* file properties, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

In code:

```
using namespace System
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
using namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
using namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Dapr
using namespace Newtonsoft.Json.Linq
param (
$payload, $order
)
# C# function processed a CreateNewOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.
Write-Host "PowerShell function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime."
# Convert the object to a JSON-formatted string with ConvertTo-Json
$jsonString = $order | ConvertTo-Json
Write-Host "$jsonString"
```


The following example shows a Dapr State input binding, which uses the [v2 Python programming model](functions-reference-python). To use the `daprState`

binding alongside the `daprServiceInvocationTrigger`

in your Python function app code:

```
import logging
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_service_invocation_trigger(arg_name="payload", method_name="RetrieveOrder")
@app.dapr_state_input(arg_name="data", state_store="statestore", key="order")
def main(payload, data: str) :
# Function should be invoked with this command: dapr invoke --app-id functionapp --method RetrieveOrder --data '{}'
logging.info('Python function processed a RetrieveOrder request from the Dapr Runtime.')
logging.info(data)
```


## Attributes

In the [in-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library), use the `DaprState`

to read Dapr state into your function, which supports these parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
StateStore |
The name of the state store to retrieve state. |
Key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |

## Annotations

The `DaprStateInput`

annotation allows you to read Dapr state into your function.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
stateStore |
The name of the Dapr state store. |
key |
The state store key value. |

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the code.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
stateStore |
The name of the state store. |
key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
key |
The name of the key to retrieve from the specified state store. |
stateStore |
The name of the state store. |

See the [Example section](#example) for complete examples.

## Usage

To use the Dapr state input binding, start by setting up a Dapr state store component. You can learn more about which component to use and how to set it up in the official Dapr documentation.

To use the `daprState`

in Python v2, set up your project with the correct dependencies.

In your

`requirements.text`

file, add the following line:`azure-functions==1.18.0b3`

In the terminal, install the Python library.

`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Modify your

`local.setting.json`

file with the following configuration:`"PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES":1`
