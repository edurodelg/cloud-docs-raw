# Tutorial: Integrate Azure Functions with an Azure virtual network by using private endpoints

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to use Azure Functions to connect to resources in an Azure virtual network by using private endpoints. You create a new function app using a new storage account that's locked behind a virtual network by using the Azure portal. The virtual network uses a Service Bus queue trigger.

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Create a function app in the Elastic Premium plan with virtual network integration and private endpoints.
- Create Azure resources, such as the Service Bus
- Lock down your Service Bus behind a private endpoint.
- Deploy a function app that uses both the Service Bus and HTTP triggers.
- Test to see that your function app is secure inside the virtual network.
- Clean up resources.

## Create a function app in a Premium plan

You create a C# function app in an [Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan), which supports networking capabilities such as virtual network integration on create along with serverless scale. This tutorial uses C# and Windows. Other languages and Linux are also supported.

On the Azure portal menu or the

**Home**page, select**Create a resource**.On the

**New**page, select**Compute**>**Function App**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the function app settings.Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Function App name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z`

(case insensitive),`0-9`

, and`-`

.**Publish**Code Choose to publish code files or a Docker container. **Runtime stack**.NET This tutorial uses .NET. **Version**6 (LTS) This tutorial uses .NET 6.0 running [in the same process as the Functions host](functions-dotnet-class-library).**Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.**Operating system**Windows This tutorial uses Windows but also works for Linux. [Plan](functions-scale)Functions Premium Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. By default, when you select **Premium**, a new App Service plan is created. The default**Sku and size**is**EP1**, where*EP*stands for*elastic premium*. For more information, see the list of[Premium SKUs](functions-premium-plan#available-instance-skus).

When you run JavaScript functions on a Premium plan, choose an instance that has fewer vCPUs. For more information, see[Choose single-core Premium plans](functions-reference-node#considerations-for-javascript-functions).Select

**Next: Storage**. On the**Storage**page, enter the following settings.Setting Suggested value Description [Storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create)Globally unique name Create a storage account used by your function app. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters long. They might contain numbers and lowercase letters only. You can also use an existing account that isn't restricted by firewall rules and meets the [storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements). When you use Functions with a locked down storage account, you need a v2 storage account. This version is the default storage version created when creating a function app with networking capabilities through the Azure portal.Select

**Next: Networking**. On the**Networking**page, enter the following settings.Note

Some of these settings aren't visible until other options are selected.

Setting Suggested value Description **Enable public access**Off Deny public network access blocks all incoming traffic except that comes from private endpoints. **Enable network injection**On The ability to configure your application with virtual network integration at creation appears in the portal window after this option is switched to **On**.**Virtual Network**Create New Select the **Create New**field. In the pop-out screen, provide a name for your virtual network and select**Ok**. Options to restrict inbound and outbound access to your function app on create are displayed. You must explicitly enable virtual network integration in the**Outbound access**portion of the window to restrict outbound access.Enter the following settings for the

**Inbound access**section. This step creates a private endpoint on your function app.Tip

To continue interacting with your function app from the Azure portal, you need to add your local computer to the virtual network. If you don't wish to restrict inbound access, skip this step.

Setting Suggested value Description **Enable private endpoints**On The ability to configure your application with virtual network integration at creation appears in the portal after this option is enabled. **Private endpoint name**myInboundPrivateEndpointName Name that identifies your new function app private endpoint. **Inbound subnet**Create New This option creates a new subnet for your inbound private endpoint. Multiple private endpoints might be added to a singular subnet. Provide a **Subnet Name**. The**Subnet Address Block**might be left at the default value. Select**Ok**. To learn more about subnet sizing, see[Subnets](functions-networking-options#subnets).**DNS**Azure Private DNS Zone This value indicates which DNS server your private endpoint uses. In most cases if you're working within Azure, Azure Private DNS Zone is the DNS zone you should use as using **Manual**for custom DNS zones have increased complexity.Enter the following settings for the

**Outbound access**section. This step integrates your function app with a virtual network on creation. It also exposes options to create private endpoints on your storage account and restrict your storage account from network access on create. When function app is virtual network integrated, all outbound traffic by default goes[through the virtual network](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#how-regional-virtual-network-integration-works).Setting Suggested value Description **Enable VNet Integration**On This setting integrates your function app with a virtual network on create and direct all outbound traffic through the virtual network. **Outbound subnet**Create new This setting creates a new subnet for your function app's virtual network integration. A function app can only be virtual network integrated with an empty subnet. Provide a **Subnet Name**. The**Subnet Address Block**might be left at the default value. Select**Ok**. The option to create**Storage private endpoints**is displayed. To use your function app with virtual networks, you need to join it to a subnet.Enter the following settings for the

**Storage private endpoint**section. This step creates private endpoints for the blob, queue, file, and table endpoints on your storage account on create. This approach effectively integrates your storage account with the virtual network.Setting Suggested value Description **Add storage private endpoint**On The ability to configure your application with virtual network integration at creation is displayed in the portal after this option is enabled. **Private endpoint name**myInboundPrivateEndpointName Name that identifies your storage account private endpoint. **Private endpoint subnet**Create New This setting creates a new subnet for your inbound private endpoint on the storage account. Multiple private endpoints might be added to a singular subnet. Provide a **Subnet Name**. The**Subnet Address Block**might be left at the default value. Select**Ok**.**DNS**Azure Private DNS Zone This value indicates which DNS server your private endpoint uses. In most cases if you're working within Azure, Azure Private DNS Zone is the DNS zone you should use as using **Manual**for custom DNS zones will have increased complexity.Select

**Next: Monitoring**. On the**Monitoring**page, enter the following settings.Setting Suggested value Description [Application Insights](functions-monitoring)Default Create an Application Insights resource of the same app name in the nearest supported region. Expand this setting if you need to change the **New resource name**or store your data in a different**Location**in an[Azure geography](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/).Select

**Review + create**to review the app configuration selections.On the

**Review + create**page, review your settings. Then select**Create**to create and deploy the function app.In the upper-right corner of the portal, select the

**Notifications**icon and watch for the**Deployment succeeded**message.Select

**Go to resource**to view your new function app. You can also select**Pin to dashboard**. Pinning makes it easier to return to this function app resource from your dashboard.

Congratulations! You successfully created your premium function app.

Note

Some deployments might occasionally fail to create the private endpoints in the storage account with the error `StorageAccountOperationInProgress`

. This failure occurs even though the function app itself gets created successfully. When you encounter such an error, delete the function app and retry the operation. You can instead create the private endpoints on the storage account manually.

### Create a Service Bus

Next, you create a Service Bus instance that is used to test the functionality of your function app's network capabilities in this tutorial.

On the Azure portal menu or the

**Home**page, select**Create a resource**.On the

**New**page, search for*Service Bus*. Then select**Create**.On the

**Basics**tab, use the following table to configure the Service Bus settings. All other settings can use the default values.Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription in which your resources are created. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup The resource group you created with your function app. **Namespace name**myServiceBus The name of the Service Bus instance for which the private endpoint is enabled. [Location](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)myFunctionRegion The region where you created your function app. **Pricing tier**Premium Choose this tier to use private endpoints with Azure Service Bus. Select

**Review + create**. After validation finishes, select**Create**.

## Lock down your Service Bus

Create the private endpoint to lock down your Service Bus:

In your new Service Bus, in the menu on the left, select

**Networking**.On the

**Private endpoint connections**tab, select**Private endpoint**.On the

**Basics**tab, use the private endpoint settings shown in the following table.Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription in which your resources are created. [Resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup The resource group you created with your function app. **Name**sb-endpoint The name of the private endpoint for the service bus. [Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)myFunctionRegion The region where you created your storage account. On the

**Resource**tab, use the private endpoint settings shown in the following table.Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription under which your resources are created. **Resource type**Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces The resource type for the Service Bus. **Resource**myServiceBus The Service Bus you created earlier in the tutorial. **Target subresource**namespace The private endpoint that is used for the namespace from the Service Bus. On the

**Virtual Network**tab, for the**Subnet**setting, choose**default**.Select

**Review + create**. After validation finishes, select**Create**.After the private endpoint is created, return to the

**Networking**section of your Service Bus namespace and check the**Public Access**tab.Ensure

**Selected networks**is selected.Select

**+ Add existing virtual network**to add the recently created virtual network.On the

**Add networks**tab, use the network settings from the following table:Setting Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription The subscription under which your resources are created. **Virtual networks**myVirtualNet The name of the virtual network to which your function app connects. **Subnets**functions The name of the subnet to which your function app connects. Select

**Add your client IP address**to give your current client IP access to the namespace.Note

Allowing your client IP address is necessary to enable the Azure portal to

[publish messages to the queue later in this tutorial](#test-your-locked-down-function-app).Select

**Enable**to enable the service endpoint.Select

**Add**to add the selected virtual network and subnet to the firewall rules for the Service Bus.Select

**Save**to save the updated firewall rules.

Resources in the virtual network can now communicate with the Service Bus using the private endpoint.

## Create a queue

Create the queue where your Azure Functions Service Bus trigger gets events:

In your Service Bus, in the menu on the left, select

**Queues**.Select

**Queue**. For the purposes of this tutorial, provide the name*queue*as the name of the new queue.Select

**Create**.

Important

This tutorial currently shows you how to connect to Service Bus using a connection string, which requires you to handle a share secret. For improved security, you should instead use managed identities when connecting to Service Bus from your app. For more information, see [Identity-based connections](functions-bindings-service-bus-trigger?tabs=extensionv5#identity-based-connections) in the Service Bus binding reference article.

## Get a Service Bus connection string

In your Service Bus, in the menu on the left, select

**Shared access policies**.Select

**RootManageSharedAccessKey**. Copy and save the**Primary Connection String**. You need this connection string when you configure the app settings.

## Configure your function app settings

In your function app, in the menu on the left, select

**Configuration**.To use your function app with virtual networks and service bus, update the app settings shown in the following table. To add or edit a setting, select

**+ New application setting**or the**Edit**icon in the rightmost column of the app settings table. When you finish, select**Save**.Setting Suggested value Description **SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION**myServiceBusConnectionString Create this app setting for the connection string of your Service Bus. This storage connection string is from the [Get a Service Bus connection string](#get-a-service-bus-connection-string)section.**WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET**1 Create this app setting. A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when your storage account is restricted to a virtual network. Since you're using an Elastic Premium hosting plan, In the

**Configuration**view, select the**Function runtime settings**tab. Set**Runtime Scale Monitoring**to**On**. Then select**Save**. Runtime-driven scaling allows you to connect non-HTTP trigger functions to services that run inside your virtual network.

Note

Runtime scaling isn't needed for function apps hosted in a Dedicated App Service plan.

## Deploy a Service Bus trigger and HTTP trigger

Note

Enabling private endpoints on a function app also makes the Source Control Manager (SCM) site publicly inaccessible. The following instructions give deployment directions using the Deployment Center within the function app. Alternatively, use [zip deploy](functions-deployment-technologies#zip-deploy) or [self-hosted](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/docker) agents that are deployed into a subnet on the virtual network.

In GitHub, go to the following sample repository. It contains a function app and two functions, an HTTP trigger, and a Service Bus queue trigger.

At the top of the page, select

**Fork**to create a fork of this repository in your own GitHub account or organization.In your function app, in the menu on the left, select

**Deployment Center**. Then select**Settings**.On the

**Settings**tab, use the deployment settings shown in the following table.Setting Suggested value Description **Source**GitHub You should have created a GitHub repository for the sample code in step 2. **Organization**myOrganization The organization your repo is checked into. It's usually your account. **Repository**functions-vnet-tutorial The repository forked from [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-vnet-tutorial](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-vnet-tutorial).**Branch**main The main branch of the repository you created. **Runtime stack**.NET The sample code is in C#. **Version**.NET Core 3.1 The runtime version. Select

**Save**.Your initial deployment might take a few minutes. When your app is successfully deployed, on the

**Logs**tab, you see a**Success (Active)**status message. If necessary, refresh the page.

Congratulations! You successfully deployed your sample function app.

### Test your locked-down function app

In your function app, in the menu on the left, select

**Functions**.Select

**ServiceBusQueueTrigger**.In the menu on the left, select

**Monitor**.

You see that you can't monitor your app. Your browser doesn't have access to the virtual network, so it can't directly access resources within the virtual network.

Here's an alternative way to monitor your function by using Application Insights:

In your function app, in the menu on the left, select

**Application Insights**. Then select**View Application Insights data**.In the menu on the left, select

**Live metrics**.Open a new tab. In your Service Bus, in the menu on the left, select

**Queues**.Select your queue.

In the menu on the left, select

**Service Bus Explorer**. Under**Send**, for**Content Type**, choose**Text/Plain**. Then enter a message.Select

**Send**to send the message.On the

**Live metrics**tab, you should see that your Service Bus queue trigger fired. If it hasn't, resend the message from**Service Bus Explorer**.

Congratulations! You successfully tested your function app setup with private endpoints.

## Understand private DNS zones

You used a private endpoint to connect to Azure resources. You're connecting to a private IP address instead of the public endpoint. Existing Azure services are configured to use an existing DNS to connect to the public endpoint. You must override the DNS configuration to connect to the private endpoint.

A private DNS zone is created for each Azure resource that was configured with a private endpoint. A DNS record is created for each private IP address associated with the private endpoint.

The following DNS zones were created in this tutorial:

- privatelink.file.core.windows.net
- privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
- privatelink.servicebus.windows.net
- privatelink.azurewebsites.net

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created Azure resources in a resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, you can delete them by deleting the resource group:

From the Azure portal menu or home page, select

**Resource groups**>**myResourceGroup**.On the

**myResourceGroup**pane, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.Select

**Delete resource group**. Type**myResourceGroup**in the text box to confirm, and then select**Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a Premium function app, storage account, and Service Bus. You secured all of these resources behind private endpoints.

# Azure Tables output bindings for Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Use an Azure Tables output binding to write entities to a table in [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/introduction) or [Azure Table Storage](../storage/tables/table-storage-overview).

For information on setup and configuration details, see the [overview](functions-bindings-storage-table)

Note

This output binding only supports creating new entities in a table. If you need to update an existing entity from your function code, instead use an Azure Tables SDK directly.

Important

This article uses tabs to support multiple versions of the Node.js programming model. The v4 model is generally available and is designed to have a more flexible and intuitive experience for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. For more details about how the v4 model works, refer to the [Azure Functions Node.js developer guide](functions-reference-node). To learn more about the differences between v3 and v4, refer to the [migration guide](functions-node-upgrade-v4).

## Example

A C# function can be created by using one of the following C# modes:

[Isolated worker model](dotnet-isolated-process-guide): Compiled C# function that runs in a worker process that's isolated from the runtime. Isolated worker process is required to support C# functions running on LTS and non-LTS versions .NET and the .NET Framework. Extensions for isolated worker process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.*`

namespaces.[In-process model](functions-dotnet-class-library): Compiled C# function that runs in the same process as the Functions runtime. In a variation of this model, Functions can be run using[C# scripting](functions-reference-csharp), which is supported primarily for C# portal editing. Extensions for in-process functions use`Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.*`

namespaces.

Important

[Support will end for the in-process model on November 10, 2026](https://aka.ms/azure-functions-retirements/in-process-model). We highly recommend that you [migrate your apps to the isolated worker model](/en-us/azure/azure-functions/migrate-dotnet-to-isolated-model) for full support.

The following `MyTableData`

class represents a row of data in the table:

```
public class MyTableData : Azure.Data.Tables.ITableEntity
{
public string Text { get; set; }
public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
public string RowKey { get; set; }
public DateTimeOffset? Timestamp { get; set; }
public ETag ETag { get; set; }
}
```


The following function, which is started by a Queue Storage trigger, writes a new `MyDataTable`

entity to a table named **OutputTable**.

```
[Function("TableFunction")]
[TableOutput("OutputTable", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]
public static MyTableData Run(
[QueueTrigger("table-items")] string input,
[TableInput("MyTable", "<PartitionKey>", "{queueTrigger}")] MyTableData tableInput,
FunctionContext context)
{
var logger = context.GetLogger("TableFunction");
logger.LogInformation($"PK={tableInput.PartitionKey}, RK={tableInput.RowKey}, Text={tableInput.Text}");
return new MyTableData()
{
PartitionKey = "queue",
RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
Text = $"Output record with rowkey {input} created at {DateTime.Now}"
};
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that uses an HTTP trigger to write a single table row.

```
public class Person {
private String PartitionKey;
private String RowKey;
private String Name;
public String getPartitionKey() {return this.PartitionKey;}
public void setPartitionKey(String key) {this.PartitionKey = key; }
public String getRowKey() {return this.RowKey;}
public void setRowKey(String key) {this.RowKey = key; }
public String getName() {return this.Name;}
public void setName(String name) {this.Name = name; }
}
public class AddPerson {
@FunctionName("addPerson")
public HttpResponseMessage get(
@HttpTrigger(name = "postPerson", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION, route="persons/{partitionKey}/{rowKey}") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<Person>> request,
@BindingName("partitionKey") String partitionKey,
@BindingName("rowKey") String rowKey,
@TableOutput(name="person", partitionKey="{partitionKey}", rowKey = "{rowKey}", tableName="%MyTableName%", connection="MyConnectionString") OutputBinding<Person> person,
final ExecutionContext context) {
Person outPerson = new Person();
outPerson.setPartitionKey(partitionKey);
outPerson.setRowKey(rowKey);
outPerson.setName(request.getBody().get().getName());
person.setValue(outPerson);
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(outPerson)
.build();
}
}
```


The following example shows a Java function that uses an HTTP trigger to write multiple table rows.

```
public class Person {
private String PartitionKey;
private String RowKey;
private String Name;
public String getPartitionKey() {return this.PartitionKey;}
public void setPartitionKey(String key) {this.PartitionKey = key; }
public String getRowKey() {return this.RowKey;}
public void setRowKey(String key) {this.RowKey = key; }
public String getName() {return this.Name;}
public void setName(String name) {this.Name = name; }
}
public class AddPersons {
@FunctionName("addPersons")
public HttpResponseMessage get(
@HttpTrigger(name = "postPersons", methods = {HttpMethod.POST}, authLevel = AuthorizationLevel.FUNCTION, route="persons/") HttpRequestMessage<Optional<Person[]>> request,
@TableOutput(name="person", tableName="%MyTableName%", connection="MyConnectionString") OutputBinding<Person[]> persons,
final ExecutionContext context) {
persons.setValue(request.getBody().get());
return request.createResponseBuilder(HttpStatus.OK)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
.body(request.getBody().get())
.build();
}
}
```


The following example shows a table output binding that writes multiple table entities.

```
import { app, HttpRequest, HttpResponseInit, InvocationContext, output } from '@azure/functions';
const tableOutput = output.table({
tableName: 'Person',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
interface PersonEntity {
PartitionKey: string;
RowKey: string;
Name: string;
}
export async function httpTrigger1(request: HttpRequest, context: InvocationContext): Promise<HttpResponseInit> {
const rows: PersonEntity[] = [];
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
rows.push({
PartitionKey: 'Test',
RowKey: i.toString(),
Name: `Name ${i}`,
});
}
context.extraOutputs.set(tableOutput, rows);
return { status: 201 };
}
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [tableOutput],
handler: httpTrigger1,
});
```


```
const { app, output } = require('@azure/functions');
const tableOutput = output.table({
tableName: 'Person',
connection: 'MyStorageConnectionAppSetting',
});
app.http('httpTrigger1', {
methods: ['POST'],
authLevel: 'anonymous',
extraOutputs: [tableOutput],
handler: async (request, context) => {
const rows = [];
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
rows.push({
PartitionKey: 'Test',
RowKey: i.toString(),
Name: `Name ${i}`,
});
}
context.extraOutputs.set(tableOutput, rows);
return { status: 201 };
},
});
```


The following example demonstrates how to write multiple entities to a table from a function.

Binding configuration in *function.json*:

```
{
"bindings": [
{
"name": "InputData",
"type": "manualTrigger",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"tableName": "Person",
"connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
"name": "TableBinding",
"type": "table",
"direction": "out"
}
],
"disabled": false
}
```


PowerShell code in *run.ps1*:

```
param($InputData, $TriggerMetadata)
foreach ($i in 1..10) {
Push-OutputBinding -Name TableBinding -Value @{
PartitionKey = 'Test'
RowKey = "$i"
Name = "Name $i"
}
}
```


The following example demonstrates how to use the Table storage output binding. Configure the `table`

binding in the *function.json* by assigning values to `name`

, `tableName`

, `partitionKey`

, and `connection`

:

The following function generates a unique UUI for the `rowKey`

value and persists the message into Table storage.

```
import logging
import uuid
import json
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.route(route="table_out_binding")
@app.table_output(arg_name="message",
connection="AzureWebJobsStorage",
table_name="messages")
def table_out_binding(req: func.HttpRequest, message: func.Out[str]):
row_key = str(uuid.uuid4())
data = {
"Name": "Output binding message",
"PartitionKey": "message",
"RowKey": row_key
}
table_json = json.dumps(data)
message.set(table_json)
return table_json
```


## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide) C# libraries use attributes to define the function. C# script instead uses a function.json configuration file as described in the [C# scripting guide](functions-reference-csharp#table-output).

In [C# class libraries](dotnet-isolated-process-guide), the `TableInputAttribute`

supports the following properties:

| Attribute property | Description |
|---|---|
TableName |
The name of the table to which to write. |
PartitionKey |
The partition key of the table entity to write. |
RowKey |
The row key of the table entity to write. |
Connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the table service. See
|

## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the [TableOutput](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-java-library/blob/master/src/main/java/com/microsoft/azure/functions/annotation/TableOutput.java/) annotation on parameters to write values into your tables. The attribute supports the following elements:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the table or entity. |
dataType |
Defines how Functions runtime should treat the parameter value. To learn more, see
|

**tableName****partitionKey****rowKey****connection**[Connections](#connections).## Configuration

The following table explains the properties that you can set on the `options`

object passed to the `output.table()`

method.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
tableName |
The name of the table to which to write. |
partitionKey |
The partition key of the table entity to write. |
rowKey |
The row key of the table entity to write. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the table service. See
|

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file.

| function.json property | Description |
|---|---|
type |
Must be set to `table` . This property is set automatically when you create the binding in the Azure portal. |
direction |
Must be set to `out` . This property is set automatically when you create the binding in the Azure portal. |
name |
The variable name used in function code that represents the table or entity. Set to `$return` to reference the function return value. |
tableName |
The name of the table to which to write. |
partitionKey |
The partition key of the table entity to write. |
rowKey |
The row key of the table entity to write. |
connection |
The name of an app setting or setting collection that specifies how to connect to the table service. See
|

When you're developing locally, add your application settings in the [local.settings.json file](functions-develop-local#local-settings-file) in the `Values`

collection.

## Connections

The `connection`

property is a reference to environment configuration that specifies how the app should connect to your table service. It may specify:

- The name of an application setting containing a
[connection string](#connection-string) - The name of a shared prefix for multiple application settings, together defining an
[identity-based connection](#identity-based-connections)

If the configured value is both an exact match for a single setting and a prefix match for other settings, the exact match is used.

### Connection string

To obtain a connection string for tables in Azure Table storage, follow the steps shown at [Manage storage account access keys](../storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage). To obtain a connection string for tables in Azure Cosmos DB for Table, follow the steps shown at the [Azure Cosmos DB for Table FAQ](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/table-api-faq#what-is-the-connection-string-that-i-need-to-use-to-connect-to-the-api-for-table-).

This connection string should be stored in an application setting with a name matching the value specified by the `connection`

property of the binding configuration.

If the app setting name begins with "AzureWebJobs", you can specify only the remainder of the name here. For example, if you set `connection`

to "MyStorage", the Functions runtime looks for an app setting that is named "AzureWebJobsMyStorage". If you leave `connection`

empty, the Functions runtime uses the default Storage connection string in the app setting that is named `AzureWebJobsStorage`

.

### Identity-based connections

If you're using [the Tables API extension](functions-bindings-storage-table#table-api-extension), instead of using a connection string with a secret, you can have the app use an [Microsoft Entra identity](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis). This only applies when accessing tables in Azure Storage. To use an identity, you define settings under a common prefix that maps to the `connection`

property in the trigger and binding configuration.

If you're setting `connection`

to "AzureWebJobsStorage", see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity). For all other connections, the extension requires the following properties:

| Property | Environment variable template | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Table Service URI | `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__tableServiceUri` 1 |
The data plane URI of the Azure Storage table service to which you're connecting, using the HTTPS scheme. | https://<storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net |

1 `<CONNECTION_NAME_PREFIX>__serviceUri`

can be used as an alias. If both forms are provided, the `tableServiceUri`

form is used. The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables.

Other properties may be set to customize the connection. See [Common properties for identity-based connections](functions-reference#common-properties-for-identity-based-connections).

The `serviceUri`

form can't be used when the overall connection configuration is to be used across blobs, queues, and/or tables in Azure Storage. The URI can only designate the table service. As an alternative, you can provide a URI specifically for each service under the same prefix, allowing a single connection to be used.

When hosted in the Azure Functions service, identity-based connections use a [managed identity](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json). The system-assigned identity is used by default, although a user-assigned identity can be specified with the `credential`

and `clientID`

properties. Note that configuring a user-assigned identity with a resource ID is **not** supported. When run in other contexts, such as local development, your developer identity is used instead, although this can be customized. See [Local development with identity-based connections](functions-reference#local-development-with-identity-based-connections).

#### Grant permission to the identity

Whatever identity is being used must have permissions to perform the intended actions. For most Azure services, this means you need to [assign a role in Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps), using either built-in or custom roles which provide those permissions.

Important

Some permissions might be exposed by the target service that are not necessary for all contexts. Where possible, adhere to the **principle of least privilege**, granting the identity only required privileges. For example, if the app only needs to be able to read from a data source, use a role that only has permission to read. It would be inappropriate to assign a role that also allows writing to that service, as this would be excessive permission for a read operation. Similarly, you would want to ensure the role assignment is scoped only over the resources that need to be read.

You'll need to create a role assignment that provides access to your Azure Storage table service at runtime. Management roles like [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) aren't sufficient. The following table shows built-in roles that are recommended when using the Azure Tables extension against Azure Storage in normal operation. Your application may require additional permissions based on the code you write.

| Binding type | Example built-in roles (Azure Storage1) |
|---|---|
| Input binding |
|

[Storage Table Data Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-table-data-contributor)1 If your app is instead connecting to tables in Azure Cosmos DB for Table, using an identity isn't supported and the connection must use a connection string.

## Usage

The usage of the binding depends on the extension package version, and the C# modality used in your function app, which can be one of the following:

An isolated worker process class library compiled C# function runs in a process isolated from the runtime.

Choose a version to see usage details for the mode and version.

When you want the function to write to a single entity, the Azure Tables output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| A JSON serializable type that implements [ITableEntity] | Functions attempts to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type as the entity. The type must implement [ITableEntity] or have a string `RowKey` property and a string `PartitionKey` property. |

When you want the function to write to multiple entities, the Azure Tables output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
`T[]` where `T` is one of the single entity types |
An array containing multiple entities. Each entry represents one entity. |

For other output scenarios, create and use a [TableClient](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables.tableclient) with other types from [Azure.Data.Tables](/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.data.tables) directly. See [Register Azure clients](dotnet-isolated-process-guide#register-azure-clients) for an example of using dependency injection to create a client type from the Azure SDK.

There are two options for outputting a Table storage row from a function by using the [TableStorageOutput](/en-us/java/api/com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.tableoutput) annotation:

| Options | Description |
|---|---|
Return value |
By applying the annotation to the function itself, the return value of the function persists as a Table storage row. |
Imperative |
To explicitly set the table row, apply the annotation to a specific parameter of the type
`OutputBinding<T>` |

`T`

includes the `PartitionKey`

and `RowKey`

properties. You can accompany these properties by implementing `ITableEntity`

or inheriting `TableEntity`

.To write to table data, use the `Push-OutputBinding`

cmdlet, set the `-Name TableBinding`

parameter and `-Value`

parameter equal to the row data. See the [PowerShell example](#example) for more detail.

There are two options for outputting a Table storage row message from a function:

| Options | Description |
|---|---|
Return value |
Set the `name` property in function.json to `$return` . With this configuration, the function's return value persists as a Table storage row. |
Imperative |
Pass a value to the
`set` is persisted as table row. |

For specific usage details, see [Example](#example).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes the networking features available across the hosting options for Azure Functions. The following networking options can be categorized as inbound and outbound networking features. Inbound features allow you to restrict access to your app, whereas outbound features allow you to connect your app to resources secured by a virtual network and control how outbound traffic is routed.

The [hosting models](functions-scale) have different levels of network isolation available. Choosing the correct one helps you meet your network isolation requirements.

## Quickstart resources

Use the following resources to quickly get started with Azure Functions networking scenarios. These resources are referenced throughout the article.

- ARM templates, Bicep files, and Terraform templates:
- ARM templates only:
- Tutorials:

## Inbound networking features

The following features let you filter inbound requests to your function app.

### Inbound access restrictions

You can use access restrictions to define a priority-ordered list of IP addresses that are allowed or denied access to your app. The list can include IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or specific virtual network subnets using [service endpoints](#use-service-endpoints). When there are one or more entries, an implicit "deny all" exists at the end of the list. IP restrictions work with all function-hosting options.

Access restrictions are available in the [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), [Consumption](consumption-plan), and [App Service](dedicated-plan).

Note

With network restrictions in place, you can deploy only from within your virtual network, or when you put the IP address of the machine you're using to access the Azure portal on the **Safe Recipients** list. However, you can still manage the function using the portal.

To learn more, see [Azure App Service static access restrictions](../app-service/app-service-ip-restrictions).

### Private endpoints

[Azure Private Endpoint](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview) is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your virtual network, effectively bringing the service into your virtual network.

You can use Private Endpoint for your functions hosted in the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan), [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans.

If you want to make calls to Private Endpoints, then you must make sure that your DNS lookups resolve to the private endpoint. You can enforce this behavior in one of the following ways:

- Integrate with Azure DNS private zones. When your virtual network doesn't have a custom DNS server, this is done automatically.
- Manage the private endpoint in the DNS server used by your app. To manage a private endpoint, you must know the endpoint address and use an A record to reference the endpoint you're trying to reach.
- Configure your own DNS server to forward to
[Azure DNS private zones](../dns/private-dns-privatednszone).

To learn more, see [using Private Endpoints for Web Apps](../app-service/networking/private-endpoint).

To call other services that have a private endpoint connection, such as storage or service bus, be sure to configure your app to make [outbound calls to private endpoints](#private-endpoints). For more details on using private endpoints with the storage account for your function app, visit [restrict your storage account to a virtual network](#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Service endpoints

Using service endpoints, you can restrict many Azure services to selected virtual network subnets to provide a higher level of security. Regional virtual network integration enables your function app to reach Azure services that are secured with service endpoints. This configuration is supported on all [plans](functions-scale#networking-features) that support virtual network integration. Follow these steps to access a secured service endpoint:

- Configure regional virtual network integration with your function app to connect to a specific subnet.
- Go to the destination service and configure service endpoints against the integration subnet.

To learn more, see [Virtual network service endpoints](../virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).

#### Use Service Endpoints

To restrict access to a specific subnet, create a restriction rule with a **Virtual Network** type. You can then select the subscription, virtual network, and subnet that you want to allow or deny access to.

If service endpoints aren't already enabled with `Microsoft.Web`

for the subnet that you selected, they're automatically enabled unless you select the **Ignore missing Microsoft.Web service endpoints** check box. The scenario where you might want to enable service endpoints on the app but not the subnet depends mainly on whether you have the permissions to enable them on the subnet.

If you need someone else to enable service endpoints on the subnet, select the **Ignore missing Microsoft.Web service endpoints** check box. Your app is configured for service endpoints, which you enable later on the subnet.

You can't use service endpoints to restrict access to apps that run in an App Service Environment. When your app is in an App Service Environment, you can control access to it by applying IP access rules.

To learn how to set up service endpoints, see [Establish Azure Functions private site access](functions-create-private-site-access).

## Outbound networking features

You can use the features in this section to manage outbound connections made by your app.

### Virtual network integration

This section details the features that Functions supports to control data outbound from your app.

Virtual network integration gives your function app access to resources in your virtual network. Once integrated, your app routes outbound traffic through the virtual network. This allows your app to access private endpoints or resources with rules allowing traffic from only select subnets. When the destination is an IP address outside of the virtual network, the source IP will still be sent from the one of the addresses listed in your app's properties, unless you've configured a NAT Gateway.

Azure Functions supports two kinds of virtual network integration:

[Regional virtual network integration](#regional-virtual-network-integration)for apps running on the[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan),[Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan),[Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan), and[Container Apps](functions-container-apps-hosting)hosting plans (recommended)[Gateway-required virtual network integration](../app-service/configure-gateway-required-vnet-integration)for apps running on the[Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan)hosting plan

To learn how to set up virtual network integration, see [Enable virtual network integration](#enable-virtual-network-integration).

### Regional virtual network integration

Using regional virtual network integration enables your app to access:

- Resources in the same virtual network as your app.
- Resources in virtual networks peered to the virtual network your app is integrated with.
- Service endpoint secured services.
- Resources across Azure ExpressRoute connections.
- Resources across peered connections, which include Azure ExpressRoute connections.
- Private endpoints

When you use regional virtual network integration, you can use the following Azure networking features:

: You can block outbound traffic with an NSG that's placed on your integration subnet. The inbound rules don't apply because you can't use virtual network integration to provide inbound access to your app.[Network security groups (NSGs)](#network-security-groups): You can place a route table on the integration subnet to send outbound traffic where you want.[Route tables (UDRs)](#routes)

Note

When you route all of your outbound traffic into your virtual network, it's subject to the NSGs and UDRs that are applied to your integration subnet. When virtual network integrated, your function app's outbound traffic to public IP addresses is still sent from the addresses that are listed in your app properties, unless you provide routes that direct the traffic elsewhere.

Regional virtual network integration isn't able to use port 25.

Considerations for the [Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan) plan:

- The app and the virtual network must be in the same region.
- Ensure that the
`Microsoft.App`

Azure resource provider is enabled for your subscription by[following these instructions](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider). This is needed for subnet delegation. The Azure portal and Azure CLI enforce this registration when you create a Flex Consumption app, since virtual network integration can be enabled at any point after your app is created. - The subnet delegation required when running in a Flex Consumption plan is
`Microsoft.App/environments`

. This differs from the Elastic Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans, which have a different delegation requirement. - You can plan for 40 IP addresses to be used at the most for one function app, even if the app scales beyond 40. For example, if you have 15 Flex Consumption function apps that are integrated in the same subnet, you must plan for 15x40 = 600 IP addresses used at the most. This limit is subject to change, and isn't enforced.
- The subnet can't already be in use for other purposes (like private or service endpoints, or
[delegated](../virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview)to any other hosting plan or service). While you can share the same subnet with multiple Flex Consumption apps, the networking resources are shared across these function apps, which can lead to one app impacting the performance of others on the same subnet. - You can't share the same subnet between a Container Apps environment and a Flex Consumption app.
- The Flex Consumption plan currently doesn't support subnets with names that contain underscore (
`_`

) characters.

Considerations for the [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan), [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan), and [Container Apps](functions-container-apps-hosting) plans:

- The feature is available for Elastic Premium and App Service Premium V2 and Premium V3. It's also available in Standard but only from newer App Service deployments. If you are on an older deployment, you can only use the feature from a Premium V2 App Service plan. If you want to make sure you can use the feature in a Standard App Service plan, create your app in a Premium V3 App Service plan. Those plans are only supported on our newest deployments. You can scale down if you desire after that.
- The feature can't be used by Isolated plan apps that are in an App Service Environment.
- The app and the virtual network must be in the same region.
- The feature requires an unused subnet that's a /28 or larger in an Azure Resource Manager virtual network.
- The integration subnet can be used by only one App Service plan.
- You can have up to two regional virtual network integrations per App Service plan. Multiple apps in the same App Service plan can use the same integration subnet.
- The subnet can't already be in use for other purposes (like private or service endpoints, or
[delegated](../virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview)to the Flex Consumption plan or any other service). While you can share the same subnet with multiple apps in the same App Service plan, the networking resources are shared across these function apps, which can lead to one app impacting the performance of others on the same subnet. - You can't delete a virtual network with an integrated app. Remove the integration before you delete the virtual network.
- You can't change the subscription of an app or a plan while there's an app that's using regional virtual network integration.

### Enable virtual network integration

In your function app in the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select**Networking**, then under**VNet Integration**select**Click here to configure**.Select

**Add VNet**.The drop-down list contains all of the Azure Resource Manager virtual networks in your subscription in the same region. Select the virtual network you want to integrate with.

The Flex Consumption and Elastic Premium hosting plans only support regional virtual network integration. If the virtual network is in the same region, either create a new subnet or select an empty, pre-existing subnet.

To select a virtual network in another region, you must have a virtual network gateway provisioned with point to site enabled. Virtual network integration across regions is only supported for Dedicated plans, but global peerings work with regional virtual network integration.


During the integration, your app is restarted. When integration is finished, you see details on the virtual network you're integrated with. By default, Route All is enabled, and all traffic is routed into your virtual network.

If you prefer to only have your private traffic ([RFC1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918#section-3) traffic) routed, follow the steps in this [App Service article](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing).

### Subnets

Virtual network integration depends on a dedicated subnet. When you provision a subnet, Azure reserves the first five IP addresses for internal use. The way remaining IP addresses are consumed depends on your hosting plan. Since subnet size can't be changed after assignment, use a subnet that's large enough to accommodate whatever scale your app might reach.

#### Elastic Premium and Dedicated Plans

In Elastic Premium and Dedicated (App Service) plans, each running instance of your function app consumes one IP address from the subnet. When you scale up or down, the required address space may temporarily double to accommodate the transition. If multiple apps share the same subnet, the total IP address usage is the sum of all instances across those apps, plus the temporary doubling during scaling events.

**IP Consumption Scenarios**

| Scenario | IP Address Consumption |
|---|---|
| 1 app, 1 instance | 1 IP address |
| 1 app, 5 instances | 5 IP addresses |
| 1 app, scaling from 5 to 10 instances | Up to 20 IP addresses (temporary, during scale operation) |
| 3 apps, 5 instances each | 15 IP addresses |

**CIDR Range Recommendations**

| CIDR block size | Max available addresses | Max horizontal scale (instances)1 |
|---|---|---|
| /28 | 11 | 5 |
| /27 | 27 | 13 |
| /26 | 59 | 29 |
| /25 | 123 | 612 |
| /24 | 251 | 1253 |

1Assumes that you need to scale up or down in either size or SKU at some point.

2 Although the number of IP addresses supports 61 instances, individual apps on the Dedicated plan have a [30 instance maximum](functions-scale#scale).

2 Although the number of IP addresses supports 125 instances, individual apps on the Elastic Premium plan have a [100 instance maximum](functions-scale#scale).

**Additional Considerations**

For function apps on the Elastic Premium or Dedicated plans:

- To avoid any issues with subnet capacity for Functions Elastic Premium plans, you should use a /24 with 256 addresses for Windows and a /26 with 64 addresses for Linux. When creating subnets in Azure portal as part of integrating with the virtual network, a minimum size of /24 and /26 is required for Windows and Linux respectively.
- Each App Service plan can support up to two subnets that can be used for VNet integration. Multiple apps from a single App Service plan can join the same subnet, but apps from a different plan can't use that same subnet.

#### Flex Consumption Plan

In the Flex Consumption plan, outbound network traffic from function app instances are routed through shared gateways that are dedicated to the subnet. Each shared gateway consumes 1 IP address from the subnet. Regardless of how many apps are integrated with a single subnet, at most 27 shared gateways (27 IP addresses) will be used to support all instances. When selecting a subnet size, what matters is the total number of instances across all apps integrated with the subnet. When a subnet is used for too many instances or for apps performing I/O intensive workloads, network capacity issues may occur such as increased average latency and timeouts. The scale-out of apps will not be affected.

A /27 subnet size (27 usable IP addresses) is recommended to support a single function app, which can scale-out to a maximum of 1,000 instances.

If you expect your single function app to scale beyond 1,000 instances or expect the total instance count of multiple function apps to exceed 1,000 instances, then use a /26 subnet and contact the product group to request an increase to your maximum instance count.

Important

Integrating Flex Consumption function apps with a subnet size less than /27 or integrating multiple apps with a /27 size subnet reduces the available outbound network capacity for them. If you plan to do so, load test your apps with production-scale workloads to ensure network capacity constraints are not observed.

**IP Consumption Scenarios**

| Scenario | Maximum IP Address Consumption |
|---|---|
| 1 app | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |
| 2 apps | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |
| 10 apps | Up to 27 IP addresses (/27 subnet size) |

### Network security groups

You can use [network security groups](../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) to control traffic between resources in your virtual network. For example, you can create a security rule that blocks your app's outbound traffic from reaching a resource in your virtual network or from leaving the network. These security rules apply to apps that have configured virtual network integration. To block traffic to public addresses, you must have virtual network integration and Route All enabled. The inbound rules in an NSG don't apply to your app because virtual network integration affects only outbound traffic from your app.

To control inbound traffic to your app, use the Access Restrictions feature. An NSG that's applied to your integration subnet is in effect regardless of any routes applied to your integration subnet. If your function app is virtual network integrated with [Route All](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing#configure-application-routing) enabled, and you don't have any routes that affect public address traffic on your integration subnet, all of your outbound traffic is still subject to NSGs assigned to your integration subnet. When Route All isn't enabled, NSGs are only applied to RFC1918 traffic.

### Routes

You can use route tables to route outbound traffic from your app to wherever you want. By default, route tables only affect your RFC1918 destination traffic. When [Route All](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing) is enabled, all of your outbound calls are affected. When Route All is disabled, only private traffic (RFC1918) is affected by your route tables. Routes that are set on your integration subnet won't affect replies to inbound app requests. Common destinations can include firewall devices or gateways.

If you want to route all outbound traffic on-premises, you can use a route table to send all outbound traffic to your ExpressRoute gateway. If you do route traffic to a gateway, be sure to set routes in the external network to send any replies back.

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes also affect your app traffic. If you have BGP routes from something like an ExpressRoute gateway, your app outbound traffic is affected. By default, BGP routes affect only your RFC1918 destination traffic. When your function app is virtual network integrated with **Route All** enabled, all outbound traffic can be affected by your BGP routes.

### Outbound IP restrictions

Outbound IP restrictions are available in a Flex Consumption plan, Elastic Premium plan, App Service plan, or App Service Environment. You can configure outbound restrictions for the virtual network where your App Service Environment is deployed.

When you integrate a function app in an Elastic Premium plan or an App Service plan with a virtual network, the app can still make outbound calls to the internet by default. By integrating your function app with a virtual network with Route All enabled, you force all outbound traffic to be sent into your virtual network, where network security group rules can be used to restrict traffic. For Flex Consumption all traffic is already routed through the virtual network and **Route All** isn't needed.

To learn how to control the outbound IP using a virtual network, see [Tutorial: Control Azure Functions outbound IP with an Azure virtual network NAT gateway](functions-how-to-use-nat-gateway).

### Azure DNS private zones

After your app integrates with your virtual network, it uses the same DNS server that your virtual network is configured with and will work with the Azure DNS private zones linked to the virtual network.

### Automation

The following APIs let you programmatically manage regional virtual network integrations:

**Azure CLI**: Use thecommands to add, list, or remove a regional virtual network integration.`az functionapp vnet-integration`

**ARM templates**: Regional virtual network integration can be enabled by using an Azure Resource Manager template. For a full example, see[this Functions quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/function-premium-vnet-integration/).

## Hybrid Connections

[Hybrid Connections](../azure-relay/relay-hybrid-connections-protocol) is a feature of Azure Relay that you can use to access application resources in other networks. It provides access from your app to an application endpoint. You can't use it to access your application. Hybrid Connections is available to functions that run on Windows in all but the Consumption plan.

As used in Azure Functions, each hybrid connection correlates to a single TCP host and port combination. This means that the hybrid connection's endpoint can be on any operating system and any application as long as you're accessing a TCP listening port. The Hybrid Connections feature doesn't know or care what the application protocol is or what you're accessing. It just provides network access.

To learn more, see the [App Service documentation for Hybrid Connections](../app-service/app-service-hybrid-connections). These same configuration steps support Azure Functions.

Important

Hybrid Connections is only supported when your function app runs on Windows. Linux apps aren't supported.

## Connecting to Azure Services through a virtual network

Virtual network integration enables your function app to access resources in a virtual network. This section overviews things you should consider when attempting to connect your app to certain services.

### Restrict your storage account to a virtual network

Note

To quickly deploy a function app with private endpoints enabled on the storage account, refer to the following template: [Function app with Azure Storage private endpoints](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/function-app-storage-private-endpoints).

When you create a function app, you must create or link to a general-purpose Azure Storage account that supports Blob, Queue, and Table storage. You can replace this storage account with one that is secured with service endpoints or private endpoints.

You can use a network restricted storage account with function apps on the Flex Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated (App Service) plans; the Consumption plan isn't supported. For Elastic Premium and Dedicated plans, you have to ensure that private [content share routing](../app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing#content-share) is configured. To learn how to configure your function app with a storage account secured with a virtual network, see [Restrict your storage account to a virtual network](configure-networking-how-to#restrict-your-storage-account-to-a-virtual-network).

### Use Key Vault references

You can use Azure Key Vault references to use secrets from Azure Key Vault in your Azure Functions application without requiring any code changes. Azure Key Vault is a service that provides centralized secrets management, with full control over access policies and audit history.

If virtual network integration is configured for the app, [Key Vault references](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) can be used to retrieve secrets from a network-restricted vault.

### Virtual network triggers (non-HTTP)

Your workload might require your app to be triggered from an event source protected by a virtual network. There's two options if you want your app to dynamically scale based on the number of events received from non-HTTP trigger sources:

- Run your function app in a
[Flex Consumption](flex-consumption-plan). - Run your function app in an
[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)and enable virtual network trigger support.

Function apps running on the [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) plans don't dynamically scale based on events. Rather, scale out is dictated by [autoscale](dedicated-plan#scaling) rules you define.

#### Elastic Premium plan with virtual network triggers

The [Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan) lets you create functions that are triggered by services secured by a virtual network. These non-HTTP triggers are known as *virtual network triggers*.

By default, virtual network triggers don't cause your function app to scale beyond their prewarmed instance count. However, certain extensions support virtual network triggers that cause your function app to scale dynamically. You can enable this *dynamic scale monitoring* in your function app for supported extensions in one of these ways:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your function app.Under

**Settings**select**Configuration**, then in the**Function runtime settings**tab set**Runtime Scale Monitoring**to**On**.Select

**Save**to update the function app configuration and restart the app.


Tip

Enabling the monitoring of virtual network triggers can affect the performance of your application, though the impact is likely to be small.

Support for dynamic scale monitoring of virtual network triggers isn't available in version 1.x of the Functions runtime.

The extensions in this table support dynamic scale monitoring of virtual network triggers. To get the best scaling performance, you should upgrade to versions that also support [target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling#premium-plan-with-runtime-scale-monitoring-enabled).

| Extension (minimum version) | Runtime scale monitoring only | With

[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.CosmosDB)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventHubs)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.ServiceBus)[Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage/)** Queue storage only.

Important

When you enable virtual network trigger monitoring, only triggers for these extensions can cause your app to scale dynamically. You can still use triggers from extensions that aren't in this table, but they won't cause scaling beyond their prewarmed instance count. For a complete list of all trigger and binding extensions, see [Triggers and bindings](functions-triggers-bindings#supported-bindings).

#### App Service plan and App Service Environment with virtual network triggers

When your function app runs in either an App Service plan or an App Service Environment, you can write functions that are triggered by resources secured by a virtual network. For your functions to get triggered correctly, your app must be connected to a virtual network with access to the resource defined in the trigger connection.

For example, assume you want to configure Azure Cosmos DB to accept traffic only from a virtual network. In this case, you must deploy your function app in an App Service plan that provides virtual network integration with that virtual network. Integration enables a function to be triggered by that Azure Cosmos DB resource.

## Testing considerations

When testing functions in a function app with private endpoints, you must do your testing from within the same virtual network, such as on a virtual machine (VM) in that network. To use the **Code + Test** option in the portal from that VM, you need to add following [CORS origins](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#cors) to your function app:

`https://functions-next.azure.com`

`https://functions-staging.azure.com`

`https://functions.azure.com`

`https://portal.azure.com`


When you restrict access to your function app with private endpoints or any other access restriction, you also must add the service tag `AzureCloud`

to the allowed list. To update the allowed list:

Navigate to your function app and select

**Settings**>**Networking**and then select**Inbound access configuration**>**Public network access**.Make sure that

**Public network access**is set to**Enabled from select virtual networks and IP addresses**.**Add a rule**under Site access and rules:Select

`Service Tag`

as the Source settings**Type**and`AzureCloud`

as the**Service Tag**.Make sure the action is

**Allow**, and set your desired name and priority.


## Troubleshooting

The feature is easy to set up, but that doesn't mean your experience will be problem free. If you encounter problems accessing your desired endpoint, there are some utilities you can use to test connectivity from the app console. There are two consoles that you can use. One is the Kudu console, and the other is the console in the Azure portal. To reach the Kudu console from your app, go to **Tools** > **Kudu**. You can also reach the Kudo console at [sitename].scm.azurewebsites.net. After the website loads, go to the **Debug console** tab. To get to the Azure portal-hosted console from your app, go to **Tools** > **Console**.

#### Tools

In native Windows apps, the tools **ping**, **nslookup**, and **tracert** won't work through the console because of security constraints (they work in [custom Windows containers](../app-service/quickstart-custom-container)). To fill the void, two separate tools are added. To test DNS functionality, we added a tool named **nameresolver.exe**. The syntax is:

```
nameresolver.exe hostname [optional: DNS Server]
```


You can use nameresolver to check the hostnames that your app depends on. This way you can test if you have anything misconfigured with your DNS or perhaps don't have access to your DNS server. You can see the DNS server that your app uses in the console by looking at the environmental variables WEBSITE_DNS_SERVER and WEBSITE_DNS_ALT_SERVER.

Note

The nameresolver.exe tool currently doesn't work in custom Windows containers.

You can use the next tool to test for TCP connectivity to a host and port combination. This tool is called **tcpping** and the syntax is:

```
tcpping.exe hostname [optional: port]
```


The **tcpping** utility tells you if you can reach a specific host and port. It can show success only if there's an application listening at the host and port combination, and there's network access from your app to the specified host and port.

#### Debug access to virtual network-hosted resources

A number of things can prevent your app from reaching a specific host and port. Most of the time it's one of these things:

**A firewall is in the way.**If you have a firewall in the way, you hit the TCP timeout. The TCP timeout is 21 seconds in this case. Use the**tcpping**tool to test connectivity. TCP timeouts can be caused by many things beyond firewalls, but start there.**DNS isn't accessible.**The DNS timeout is 3 seconds per DNS server. If you have two DNS servers, the timeout is 6 seconds. Use nameresolver to see if DNS is working. You can't use nslookup, because that doesn't use the DNS your virtual network is configured with. If inaccessible, you could have a firewall or NSG blocking access to DNS or it could be down.

If those items don't answer your problems, look first for things like:

**Regional virtual network integration**

- Is your destination a non-RFC1918 address and you don't have
**Route All**enabled? - Is there an NSG blocking egress from your integration subnet?
- If you're going across Azure ExpressRoute or a VPN, is your on-premises gateway configured to route traffic back up to Azure? If you can reach endpoints in your virtual network but not on-premises, check your routes.
- Do you have enough permissions to set delegation on the integration subnet? During regional virtual network integration configuration, your integration subnet is delegated to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms. The VNet integration UI delegates the subnet to Microsoft.Web/serverFarms automatically. If your account doesn't have sufficient networking permissions to set delegation, you'll need someone who can set attributes on your integration subnet to delegate the subnet. To manually delegate the integration subnet, go to the Azure Virtual Network subnet UI and set the delegation for Microsoft.Web/serverFarms.

**Gateway-required virtual network integration**

- Is the point-to-site address range in the RFC 1918 ranges (10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 / 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 / 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255)?
- Does the gateway show as being up in the portal? If your gateway is down, then bring it back up.
- Do certificates show as being in sync, or do you suspect that the network configuration was changed? If your certificates are out of sync or you suspect that a change was made to your virtual network configuration that wasn't synced with your ASPs, select
**Sync Network**. - If you're going across a VPN, is the on-premises gateway configured to route traffic back up to Azure? If you can reach endpoints in your virtual network but not on-premises, check your routes.
- Are you trying to use a coexistence gateway that supports both point to site and ExpressRoute? Coexistence gateways aren't supported with virtual network integration.

Debugging networking issues is a challenge because you can't see what's blocking access to a specific host:port combination. Some causes include:

- You have a firewall up on your host that prevents access to the application port from your point-to-site IP range. Crossing subnets often requires public access.
- Your target host is down.
- Your application is down.
- You had the wrong IP or hostname.
- Your application is listening on a different port than what you expected. You can match your process ID with the listening port by using "netstat -aon" on the endpoint host.
- Your network security groups are configured in such a manner that they prevent access to your application host and port from your point-to-site IP range.

You don't know what address your app actually uses. It could be any address in the integration subnet or point-to-site address range, so you need to allow access from the entire address range.

More debug steps include:

- Connect to a VM in your virtual network and attempt to reach your resource host:port from there. To test for TCP access, use the PowerShell command
**Test-NetConnection**. The syntax is:

```
Test-NetConnection hostname [optional: -Port]
```


- Bring up an application on a VM and test access to that host and port from the console from your app by using
**tcpping**.

#### On-premises resources

If your app can't reach a resource on-premises, check if you can reach the resource from your virtual network. Use the **Test-NetConnection** PowerShell command to check for TCP access. If your VM can't reach your on-premises resource, your VPN or ExpressRoute connection might not be configured properly.

If your virtual network-hosted VM can reach your on-premises system but your app can't, the cause is likely one of the following reasons:

- Your routes aren't configured with your subnet or point-to-site address ranges in your on-premises gateway.
- Your network security groups are blocking access for your point-to-site IP range.
- Your on-premises firewalls are blocking traffic from your point-to-site IP range.
- You're trying to reach a non-RFC 1918 address by using the regional virtual network integration feature.

#### Deleting the App Service plan or web app before disconnecting the VNet integration

If you deleted the web app or the App Service plan without disconnecting the VNet integration first, you will not be able to do any update/delete operations on the virtual network or subnet that was used for the integration with the deleted resource. A subnet delegation 'Microsoft.Web/serverFarms' will remain assigned to your subnet and will prevent the update/delete operations.

In order to do update/delete the subnet or virtual network again you need to re-create the VNet integration and then disconnect it:

- Re-create the App Service plan and web app (it is mandatory to use the exact same web app name as before).
- Navigate to the 'Networking' blade on the web app and configure the VNet integration.
- After the VNet integration is configured, select the 'Disconnect' button.
- Delete the App Service plan or web app.
- Update/Delete the subnet or virtual network.

If you still encounter issues with the VNet integration after following the steps above, please contact Microsoft Support.

### Network troubleshooter

You can also use the Network troubleshooter to resolve connection issues. To open the network troubleshooter, go to the app in the Azure portal. Select **Diagnostic and solve problem**, and then search for **Network troubleshooter**.

**Connection issues** - It checks the status of the virtual network integration, including checking if the Private IP has been assigned to all instances of the plan and the DNS settings. If a custom DNS isn't configured, default Azure DNS is applied. The troubleshooter also checks for common Function app dependencies including connectivity for Azure Storage and other binding dependencies.


**Configuration issues** - This troubleshooter checks if your subnet is valid for virtual network integration.


**Subnet/VNet deletion issue** - This troubleshooter checks if your subnet has any locks and if it has any unused Service Association Links that might be blocking the deletion of the VNet/subnet.

# Tutorial: Create a function app that connects to Azure services using identities instead of secrets

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This tutorial shows you how to configure a function app using Microsoft Entra identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed. To learn more about identity-based connections, see [configure an identity-based connection](functions-reference#configure-an-identity-based-connection).

While the procedures shown work generally for all languages, this tutorial currently supports C# class library functions on Windows specifically.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create a function app in Azure using an ARM template
- Enable both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities on the function app
- Create role assignments that give permissions to other resources
- Move secrets that can't be replaced with identities into Azure Key Vault
- Configure an app to connect to the default host storage using its managed identity

After you complete this tutorial, you should complete the follow-on tutorial that shows how to [use identity-based connections instead of secrets with triggers and bindings](functions-identity-based-connections-tutorial-2).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

## Why use identity?

Managing secrets and credentials is a common challenge for teams of all sizes. Secrets need to be secured against theft or accidental disclosure, and they might need to be periodically rotated. Many Azure services allow you to instead use an identity in [Microsoft Entra ID](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) to authenticate clients and check against permissions, which can be modified and revoked quickly. Doing so allows for greater control over application security with less operational overhead. An identity could be a human user, such as the developer of an application, or a running application in Azure with a [managed identity](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

Because some services don't support Microsoft Entra authentication, your applications might still require secrets in certain cases. However, these secrets can be stored in [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview), which helps simplify the management lifecycle for your secrets. Access to a key vault is also controlled with identities.

By understanding how to use identities instead of secrets when you can, and to use Key Vault when you can't, you reduce risk, decrease operational overhead, and generally improve the security posture for your applications.

## Create a function app that uses Key Vault for necessary secrets

Azure Files is an example of a service that doesn't yet support Microsoft Entra authentication for Server Message Block (SMB) file shares. Azure Files is the default file system for Windows deployments on Premium and Consumption plans. While we could [remove Azure Files entirely](storage-considerations#create-an-app-without-azure-files), doing so introduces limitations you might not want. Instead, you move the Azure Files connection string into Azure Key Vault. That way it's centrally managed, with access controlled by the identity.

### Create an Azure Key Vault

First you need a key vault to store secrets in. You configure it to use [Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview) for determining who can read secrets from the vault.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Security**>**Key Vault**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the key vault.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Key vault name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new key vault. The vault name must only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes and can't start with a number. **Pricing Tier**Standard Options for billing. Standard is sufficient for this tutorial. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.Use the default selections for the "Recovery options" sections.

Make a note of the name you used, for use later.

Select

**Next: Access Policy**to navigate to the**Access Policy**tab.Under

**Permission model**, choose**Azure role-based access control**Select

**Review + create**. Review the configuration, and then select**Create**.

### Set up an identity and permissions for the app

In order to use Azure Key Vault, your app needs to have an identity that can be granted permission to read secrets. This app uses a user-assigned identity so that the permissions can be set up before the app is even created. For more information about managed identities for Azure Functions, see [How to use managed identities in Azure Functions](../app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Identity**>**User Assigned Managed Identity**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the identity.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.**Name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new user-assigned identity. Select

**Review + create**. Review the configuration, and then select**Create**.When the identity is created, navigate to it in the portal. Select

**Properties**, and make note of the**Resource ID**for use later.Select

**Azure Role Assignments**, and select**Add role assignment (Preview)**.In the

**Add role assignment (Preview)**page, use options as shown in the following table.Option Suggested value Description **Scope**Key Vault Scope is a set of resources that the role assignment applies to. Scope has levels that are inherited at lower levels. For example, if you select a subscription scope, the role assignment applies to all resource groups and resources in the subscription. **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. **Resource**Your key vault The key vault you created earlier. **Role**Key Vault Secrets User A role is a collection of permissions that are being granted. Key Vault Secrets User gives permission for the identity to read secret values from the vault. Select

**Save**. It might take a minute or two for the role to show up when you refresh the role assignments list for the identity.

The identity is now able to read secrets stored in the key vault. Later in the tutorial, you add additional role assignments for different purposes.

### Generate a template for creating a function app

Because the portal experience for creating a function app doesn't interact with Azure Key Vault, you need to generate and edit an Azure Resource Manager template. You can then use this template to create your function app referencing the Azure Files connection string from your key vault.

Important

Don't create the function app until after you edit the ARM template. The Azure Files configuration needs to be set up at app creation time.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose**Create a resource (+)**.On the

**Create a resource**page, select**Compute**>**Function App**.On the

**Basics**page, use the following table to configure the function app.Option Suggested value Description **Subscription**Your subscription Subscription under which this new function app is created. [Resource Group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview)myResourceGroup Name for the new resource group where you create your function app. **Function App name**Globally unique name Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z`

(case insensitive),`0-9`

, and`-`

.**Publish**Code Choose to publish code files or a Docker container. **Runtime stack**.NET This tutorial uses .NET. **Region**Preferred region Choose a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/)near you or near other services that your functions access.Select

**Review + create**. Your app uses the default values on the**Hosting**and**Monitoring**page. Review the default options, which are included in the ARM template that you generate.Instead of creating your function app here, choose

**Download a template for automation**, which is to the right of the**Next**button.In the template page, select

**Deploy**, then in the Custom deployment page, select**Edit template**.

### Edit the template

You now edit the template to store the Azure Files connection string in Key Vault and allow your function app to reference it. Make sure that you have the following values from the earlier sections before proceeding:

- The resource ID of the user-assigned identity
- The name of your key vault

Note

If you were to create a full template for automation, you would want to include definitions for the identity and role assignment resources, with the appropriate `dependsOn`

clauses. This would replace the earlier steps which used the portal. Consult the [Azure Resource Manager guidance](../azure-resource-manager/templates/syntax) and the documentation for each service.

In the editor, find where the

`resources`

array begins. Before the function app definition, add the following section, which puts the Azure Files connection string into Key Vault. Substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault.`{ "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets", "apiVersion": "2016-10-01", "name": "VAULT_NAME/azurefilesconnectionstring", "properties": { "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=',parameters('storageAccountName'),';AccountKey=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageAccountName')), '2019-06-01').keys[0].value,';EndpointSuffix=','core.windows.net')]" }, "dependsOn": [ "[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', parameters('storageAccountName'))]" ] },`

In the definition for the function app resource (which has

`type`

set to`Microsoft.Web/sites`

), add`Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/VAULT_NAME/secrets/azurefilesconnectionstring`

to the`dependsOn`

array. Again, substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault. Doing so prevents your app from being created before the secret is defined. The`dependsOn`

array should look like the following example:`{ "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites", "apiVersion": "2018-11-01", "name": "[parameters('name')]", "location": "[parameters('location')]", "tags": null, "dependsOn": [ "microsoft.insights/components/idcxntut", "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/VAULT_NAME/secrets/azurefilesconnectionstring", "[concat('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/', parameters('hostingPlanName'))]", "[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', parameters('storageAccountName'))]" ], // ... }`

Add the

`identity`

block from the following example into the definition for your function app resource. Substitute "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID" for the resource ID of your user-assigned identity.`{ "apiVersion": "2018-11-01", "name": "[parameters('name')]", "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites", "kind": "functionapp", "location": "[parameters('location')]", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned,UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": { "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID": {} } }, "tags": null, // ... }`

This

`identity`

block also sets up a system-assigned identity, which you use later in this tutorial.Add the

`keyVaultReferenceIdentity`

property to the`properties`

object for the function app, as in the following example. Substitute "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID" for the resource ID of your user-assigned identity.`{ // ... "properties": { "name": "[parameters('name')]", "keyVaultReferenceIdentity": "IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID", // ... } }`

You need this configuration because an app could have multiple user-assigned identities configured. Whenever you want to use a user-assigned identity, you must specify it with an ID. System-assigned identities don't need to be specified this way, because an app can only ever have one. Many features that use managed identity assume they should use the system-assigned one by default.

Find the JSON objects that define the

`WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

application setting, which should look like the following example:`{ "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING", "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=',parameters('storageAccountName'),';AccountKey=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageAccountName')), '2019-06-01').keys[0].value,';EndpointSuffix=','core.windows.net')]" },`

Replace the

`value`

field with a reference to the secret as shown in the following example. Substitute "VAULT_NAME" with the name of your key vault.`{ "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING", "value": "[concat('@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=', reference(resourceId('Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets', 'VAULT_NAME', 'azurefilesconnectionstring')).secretUri, ')')]" },`

Select

**Save**to save the updated ARM template.

### Deploy the modified template

Make sure that your create options, including

**Resource Group**, are still correct and select**Review + create**.After your template validates, make a note of your

**Storage Account Name**, since you'll use this account later. Finally, select**Create**to create your Azure resources and deploy your code to the function app.After deployment completes, select

**Go to resource group**and then select the new function app.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your function app to reference the Azure Files connection string from Azure Key Vault.

Whenever your app would need to add a reference to a secret, you would just need to define a new application setting pointing to the value stored in Key Vault. For more information, see [Key Vault references for Azure Functions](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references?toc=/azure/azure-functions/toc.json).

Tip

The [Application Insights connection string](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string) and its included instrumentation key are not considered secrets and can be retrieved from App Insights using [Reader](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#reader) permissions. You do not need to move them into an Azure Key Vault instance, although you certainly can. If you choose to use Key Vault, your function app must have a managed identity that can be used to securely retrieve the secret [using a Key Vault reference in the app settings](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references).

## Use managed identity for AzureWebJobsStorage

Next, you use the system-assigned identity you configured in the previous steps for the `AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection. `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used by the Functions runtime and by several triggers and bindings to coordinate between multiple running instances. It's required for your function app to operate, and like Azure Files, is configured with a connection string by default when you create a new function app.

### Grant the system-assigned identity access to the storage account

Similar to the steps you previously followed with the user-assigned identity and your key vault, you now create a role assignment granting the system-assigned identity access to your storage account.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the storage account that was created with your function app earlier.Select

**Access Control (IAM)**. This page is where you can view and configure who has access to the resource.Select

**Add**and select**add role assignment**.Search for

**Storage Blob Data Owner**, select it, and select**Next**On the

**Members**tab, under**Assign access to**, choose**Managed Identity**Select

**Select members**to open the**Select managed identities**panel.Confirm that the

**Subscription**is the one in which you created the resources earlier.In the

**Managed identity**selector, choose**Function App**from the**System-assigned managed identity**category. The**Function App**label might have a number in parentheses next to it, indicating the number of apps in the subscription with system-assigned identities.Your app should appear in a list below the input fields. If you don't see it, you can use the

**Select**box to filter the results with your app's name.Select your application. It should move down into the

**Selected members**section. Choose**Select**.On the

**Add role assignment**screen, select**Review + assign**. Review the configuration, and then select**Review + assign**.

Tip

If you intend to use the function app for a blob-triggered function, you will need to repeat these steps for the **Storage Account Contributor** and **Storage Queue Data Contributor** roles over the account used by AzureWebJobsStorage. To learn more, see [Blob trigger identity-based connections](functions-bindings-storage-blob-trigger#identity-based-connections).

### Edit the AzureWebJobsStorage configuration

Next you update your function app to use its system-assigned identity when it uses the blob service for host storage.

Important

The `AzureWebJobsStorage`

configuration is used by some triggers and bindings, and those extensions must be able to use identity-based connections, too. Apps that use blob triggers or event hub triggers may need to update those extensions. Because no functions have been defined for this app, there isn't a concern yet. To learn more about this requirement, see [Connecting to host storage with an identity](functions-reference#connecting-to-host-storage-with-an-identity).

Similarly, `AzureWebJobsStorage`

is used for deployment artifacts when using server-side build in Linux Consumption. When you enable identity-based connections for `AzureWebJobsStorage`

in Linux Consumption, you will need to deploy via [an external deployment package](run-functions-from-deployment-package).

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your function app.In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, select the**AzureWebJobsStorage**app setting, and edit it according to the following table:Option Suggested value Description **Name**AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName Change the name from **AzureWebJobsStorage**to the exact name`AzureWebJobsStorage__accountName`

. This setting instructs the host to use the identity instead of searching for a stored secret. The new setting uses a double underscore (`__`

), which is a special character in application settings.**Value**Your account name Update the name from the connection string to just your **StorageAccountName**.This configuration tells the system to use an identity to connect to the resource.

Select

**Apply**, and then select**Apply**and**Confirm**to save your changes and restart the app function.

You've now removed the storage connection string requirement for AzureWebJobsStorage by configuring your app to instead connect to blobs using managed identities.

Note

The `__accountName`

syntax is unique to the AzureWebJobsStorage connection and cannot be used for other storage connections. To learn to define other connections, check the reference for each trigger and binding your app uses.

## Next steps

This tutorial showed how to create a function app without storing secrets in its configuration.

Advance to the next tutorial to learn how to use identities in trigger and binding connections.

To identify the actual cause of your issue, you need to get the Python project files that run on your function app. If you don't have the project files on your local computer, you can get them in one of the following ways:

- If the function app has a
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

app setting and its value is a URL, download the file by copying and pasting the URL into your browser. - If the function app has
`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

set to`1`

, go to`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/vfs/data/SitePackages`

and download the file from the latest`href`

URL. - If the function app doesn't have either of the preceding app settings, go to
`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/settings`

and find the URL under`SCM_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

. Download the file by copying and pasting the URL into your browser. - If suggestions resolve the issue, go to
`https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole`

and view the content under`/home/site/wwwroot`

.

The rest of this article helps you troubleshoot potential causes of this error by inspecting your function app's content, identifying the root cause, and resolving the specific issue.

### Diagnose ModuleNotFoundError

This section details potential root causes of module-related errors. After you figure out which is the likely root cause, you can go to the related mitigation.

#### The package can't be found

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>`

. If the file path doesn't exist, this missing path is likely the root cause.

Using third-party or outdated tools during deployment might cause this issue.

To mitigate this issue, see [Enable remote build](#enable-remote-build) or [Build native dependencies](#build-native-dependencies).

#### The package isn't resolved with the proper Linux wheel

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

. Use your favorite text editor to open the *wheel* file and check the **Tag:** section. The issue might be that the tag value doesn't contain **linux**.

Python functions run only on Linux in Azure. The Functions runtime v2.x runs on Debian Stretch, and the v3.x runtime runs on Debian Buster. The artifact is expected to contain the correct Linux binaries. When you use the `--build local`

flag in Core Tools, third-party, or outdated tools, it might cause older binaries to be used.

To mitigate the issue, see [Enable remote build](#enable-remote-build) or [Build native dependencies](#build-native-dependencies).

#### The package is incompatible with the Python interpreter version

Go to `.python_packages/lib/python3.6/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

or `.python_packages/lib/site-packages/<package-name>-<version>-dist-info`

. In your text editor, open the *METADATA* file and check the **Classifiers:** section. If the section doesn't contain `Python :: 3`

, `Python :: 3.6`

, `Python :: 3.7`

, `Python :: 3.8`

, or `Python :: 3.9`

, the package version is either too old or, more likely, it's already out of maintenance.

You can check the Python version of your function app from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Navigate to your function app's **Overview** resource page to find the runtime version. The runtime version supports Python versions as described in the [Azure Functions runtime versions overview](functions-versions).

To mitigate the issue, see [Update your package to the latest version](#update-your-package-to-the-latest-version) or [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents).

#### The package conflicts with other packages

If you've verified that the package is resolved correctly with the proper Linux wheels, there might be a conflict with other packages. In certain packages, the PyPi documentation might clarify the incompatible modules. For example, in [ azure 4.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/azure/4.0.0/), you find the following statement:

This package isn't compatible with azure-storage. If you installed azure-storage, or if you installed azure 1.x/2.x and didn’t uninstall azure-storage, you must uninstall azure-storage first.


You can find the documentation for your package version in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>/<package-version>`

.

To mitigate the issue, see [Update your package to the latest version](#update-your-package-to-the-latest-version) or [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents).

#### The package supports only Windows and macOS platforms

Open the `requirements.txt`

with a text editor and check the package in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

. Some packages run only on Windows and macOS platforms. For example, pywin32 runs on Windows only.

The `Module Not Found`

error might not occur when you're using Windows or macOS for local development. However, the package fails to import on Azure Functions, which uses Linux at runtime. This issue is likely to be caused by using `pip freeze`

to export the virtual environment into *requirements.txt* from your Windows or macOS machine during project initialization.

To mitigate the issue, see [Replace the package with equivalents](#replace-the-package-with-equivalents) or [Handcraft requirements.txt](#handcraft-requirementstxt).

### Mitigate ModuleNotFoundError

The following are potential mitigations for module-related issues. Use the [previously mentioned diagnoses](#diagnose-modulenotfounderror) to determine which of these mitigations to try.

#### Enable remote build

Make sure that remote build is enabled. The way that you make sure depends on your deployment method.

Make sure that the latest version of the [Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) is installed. Verify that the *.vscode/settings.json* file exists and it contains the setting `"azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment": true`

. If it doesn't, create the file with the `azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment`

setting enabled, and then redeploy the project.

#### Build native dependencies

Make sure that the latest versions of both Docker and [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/releases) are installed. Go to your local function project folder, and use `func azure functionapp publish <app-name> --build-native-deps`

for deployment.

#### Update your package to the latest version

In the latest package version of `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

, check the **Classifiers:** section. The package should be `OS Independent`

, or compatible with `POSIX`

or `POSIX :: Linux`

in **Operating System**. Also, the programming language should contain: `Python :: 3`

, `Python :: 3.6`

, `Python :: 3.7`

, `Python :: 3.8`

, or `Python :: 3.9`

.

If these package items are correct, you can update the package to the latest version by changing the line `<package-name>~=<latest-version>`

in *requirements.txt*.

#### Handcraft requirements.txt

Some developers use `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

to generate the list of Python packages for their developing environments. Although this convenience should work in most cases, there can be issues in cross-platform deployment scenarios, such as developing functions locally on Windows or macOS, but publishing to a function app, which runs on Linux. In this scenario, `pip freeze`

can introduce unexpected operating system-specific dependencies or dependencies for your local development environment. These dependencies can break the Python function app when it's running on Linux.

The best practice is to check the import statement from each *.py* file in your project source code and then check in only the modules in the *requirements.txt* file. This practice guarantees that the resolution of packages can be handled properly on different operating systems.

#### Replace the package with equivalents

First, take a look into the latest version of the package in `https://pypi.org/project/<package-name>`

. This package usually has its own GitHub page. Go to the **Issues** section on GitHub and search to see whether your issue has been fixed. If it has been fixed, update the package to the latest version.

Sometimes, the package might have been integrated into [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) (such as `pathlib`

). If so, because we provide a certain Python distribution in Azure Functions (Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Python 3.8, and Python 3.9), the package in your *requirements.txt* file should be removed.

However, if you're finding that the issue hasn't been fixed, and you're on a deadline, we encourage you to do some research to find a similar package for your project. Usually, the Python community provides you with a wide variety of similar libraries that you can use.

#### Disable dependency isolation flag

Set the application setting [PYTHON_ISOLATE_WORKER_DEPENDENCIES](functions-app-settings#python_isolate_worker_dependencies) to a value of `0`

.

## Troubleshoot: cannot import 'cygrpc'

This section helps you troubleshoot 'cygrpc'-related errors in your Python function app. These errors typically result in the following Azure Functions error message:

Cannot import name 'cygrpc' from 'grpc._cython'


This error occurs when a Python function app fails to start with a proper Python interpreter. The root cause for this error is one of the following issues:

[The Python interpreter mismatches OS architecture](#the-python-interpreter-mismatches-os-architecture)[The Python interpreter isn't supported by Azure Functions Python Worker](#the-python-interpreter-isnt-supported-by-azure-functions-python-worker)

### Diagnose the 'cygrpc' reference error

There are several possible causes for errors that reference `cygrpc`

, which are detailed in this section.

#### The Python interpreter mismatches OS architecture

This mismatch is most likely caused by a 32-bit Python interpreter being installed on your 64-bit operating system.

If you're running on an x64 operating system, ensure that your Python version 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9 interpreter is also on a 64-bit version.

You can check your Python interpreter bitness by running the following commands:

On Windows in PowerShell, run `py -c 'import platform; print(platform.architecture()[0])'`

.

On a Unix-like shell, run `python3 -c 'import platform; print(platform.architecture()[0])'`

.

If there's a mismatch between Python interpreter bitness and the operating system architecture, download a proper Python interpreter from [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads).

#### The Python interpreter isn't supported by Azure Functions Python Worker

The Azure Functions Python Worker supports only [specific Python versions](functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-python#languages).

Check to see whether your Python interpreter matches your expected version by `py --version`

in Windows or `python3 --version`

in Unix-like systems. Ensure that the return result is one of the [supported Python versions](functions-versions?pivots=programming-language-python#languages).

If your Python interpreter version doesn't meet the requirements for Azure Functions, instead download a Python interpreter version that is supported by Functions from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads).

## Troubleshoot: python exited with code 137

Code 137 errors are typically caused by out-of-memory issues in your Python function app. As a result, you get the following Azure Functions error message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.Workers.WorkerProcessExitException : python exited with code 137


This error occurs when a Python function app is forced to terminate by the operating system with a `SIGKILL`

signal. This signal usually indicates an out-of-memory error in your Python process. The Azure Functions platform has a [service limitation](functions-scale#service-limits) that terminates any function apps that exceed this limit.

To analyze the memory bottleneck in your function app, see [Profile Python function app in local development environment](python-memory-profiler-reference#memory-profiling-process).

## Troubleshoot: python exited with code 139

This section helps you troubleshoot segmentation fault errors in your Python function app. These errors typically result in the following Azure Functions error message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Script.Workers.WorkerProcessExitException : python exited with code 139


This error occurs when a Python function app is forced to terminate by the operating system with a `SIGSEGV`

signal. This signal indicates violation of the memory segmentation, which can result from an unexpected reading from or writing into a restricted memory region. In the following sections, we provide a list of common root causes.

### A regression from third-party packages

In your function app's *requirements.txt* file, an unpinned package gets upgraded to the latest version during each deployment to Azure. Package updates can potentially introduce regressions that affect your app. To recover from such issues, comment out the import statements, disable the package references, or pin the package to a previous version in *requirements.txt*.

### Unpickling from a malformed .pkl file

If your function app is using the Python pickle library to load a Python object from a *.pkl* file, it's possible that the file contains a malformed bytes string or an invalid address reference. To recover from this issue, try commenting out the `pickle.load()`

function.

### Pyodbc connection collision

If your function app is using the popular ODBC database driver [pyodbc](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc), it's possible that multiple connections are open within a single function app. To avoid this issue, use the singleton pattern, and ensure that only one pyodbc connection is used across the function app.

## Sync triggers failed

The error `Sync triggers failed`

can be caused by several issues. One potential cause is a conflict between customer-defined dependencies and Python built-in modules when your functions run in an App Service plan. For more information, see [Package management](functions-reference-python#package-management).

## Troubleshoot: could not load file or assembly

You can see this error when you're running locally using the v2 programming model. This error is caused by a known issue to be resolved in an upcoming release.

This is an example message for this error:

DurableTask.Netherite.AzureFunctions: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=014045d636e89289'.


The system cannot find the file specified.

The error occurs because of an issue with how the extension bundle was cached. To troubleshoot the issue, run this command with `--verbose`

to see more details:

```
func host start --verbose
```


It's likely you're seeing this caching issue when you see an extension loading log like `Loading startup extension <>`

that isn't followed by `Loaded extension <>`

.

To resolve this issue:

Find the

`.azure-functions-core-tools`

path by running:`func GetExtensionBundlePath`

Delete the

`.azure-functions-core-tools`

directory.`rm -r <insert path>/.azure-functions-core-tools`


The cache directory is recreated when you run Core Tools again.

## Troubleshoot: unable to resolve the Azure Storage connection

You might see this error in your local output as the following message:

Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask: Unable to resolve the Azure Storage connection named 'Storage'.


Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'provider')

This error is a result of how extensions are loaded from the bundle locally. To resolve this error, take one of the following actions:

Use a storage emulator such as

[Azurite](../storage/common/storage-use-azurite). This option is a good one when you aren't planning to use a storage account in your function application.Create a storage account and add a connection string to the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

environment variable in the*localsettings.json*file. Use this option when you're using a storage account trigger or binding with your application, or if you have an existing storage account. To get started, see[Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create).

## Functions not found after deployment

There are several common build issues that can cause Python functions to not be found by the host after an apparently successful deployment:

The agent pool must be running on Ubuntu to guarantee that packages are restored correctly from the build step. Make sure your deployment template requires an Ubuntu environment for build and deployment.

When the function app isn't at the root of the source repo, make sure that the

`pip install`

step references the correct location in which to create the`.python_packages`

folder. Keep in mind that this location is case sensitive, such as in this command example:`pip install --target="./FunctionApp1/.python_packages/lib/site-packages" -r ./FunctionApp1/requirements.txt`

The template must generate a deployment package that can be loaded into

`/home/site/wwwroot`

. In Azure Pipelines, this is done by the`ArchiveFiles`

task.

## Development issues in the Azure portal

When using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), take into account these known issues and their workarounds:

- There are general limitations for writing your function code in the portal. For more information, see
[Development limitations in the Azure portal](functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings#development-limitations-in-the-azure-portal).

- To delete a function from a function app in the portal, remove the function code from the file itself. The
**Delete**button doesn't work to remove the function when using the Python v2 programming model.

- When creating a function in the portal, you might be admonished to use a different tool for development. There are several scenarios where you can't edit your code in the portal, including when a syntax error has been detected. In these scenarios, use
[Visual Studio Code](functions-develop-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python)or[Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local?pivots=programming-language-python)to develop and publish your function code.

# How to use a secured storage account with Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Functions requires an Azure Storage account when you create a function app instance. This default storage account is used by the Functions runtime to maintain the health of your function app. For more information, see [Storage considerations for Azure Functions](storage-considerations). This article shows you how to use a secured storage account as the default storage account. For an in-depth tutorial on how to create your function app with inbound and outbound access restrictions, see the [Integrate with a virtual network](functions-create-vnet) tutorial. To learn more about Azure Functions and networking, see [Azure Functions networking options](functions-networking-options).

## Restrict your storage account to a virtual network

When you create a function app, you either create a new storage account or link to an existing one. Keep these considerations in mind when working with secured storage account.

- To create a function app that uses an existing secured storage account as the default storage account, you must create your app either in the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)or by using[ARM template](functions-infrastructure-as-code?tabs=json&pivots=premium-plan#secured-deployments)or[Bicep](functions-infrastructure-as-code?tabs=bicep&pivots=premium-plan#secured-deployments)deployments. - When using a secured storage account with a dynamic scale plan, you should host your functions in the
[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). This plan supports both secured storage accounts and managed identity-based connections to storage, which is the most secure connection option. - All tiers of both the
[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)and the[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)also support secure storage accounts. However, there are trade-offs when using managed identities to connect from a Premium plan app. For more information, see[Create an app without Azure Files](storage-considerations#create-an-app-without-azure-files). - The
[Consumption plan](consumption-plan)doesn't support virtual networks, so you can't connect to a secured storage account when running in the Consumption plan. To take advantage of serverless function hosting, you should instead recreate your app to run in Flex Consumption plan. - This article currently shows you how to create a function app in a Premium plan that connects to a secured storage account using the storage account connection string. To provide the best protection of storage account credentials, you should instead use managed identities when connecting to a storage account. Instead follow the
[Quickstart: Create and deploy functions to Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI](create-first-function-azure-developer-cli)to create a function app in the Flex Consumption plan that connects to a new secured storage account using managed identities. - For a list of all restrictions on storage accounts, see
[Storage account requirements](storage-considerations#storage-account-requirements).

## Secure storage during function app creation

You can create a function app, along with a new storage account that is secured behind a virtual network. The following sections show you how to create these resources by using either the Azure portal or by using deployment templates.

Complete the steps in [Create a function app in a Premium plan](functions-create-vnet#create-a-function-app-in-a-premium-plan). This section of the virtual networking tutorial shows you how to create a function app that connects to storage over private endpoints.

Note

When you create your function app in the Azure portal, you can also choose an existing secured storage account in the **Storage** tab. However, you must configure the appropriate networking on the function app so that it can connect through the virtual network used to secure the storage account. If you don't have permissions to configure networking or you haven't fully prepared your network, select **Configure networking after creation** in the **Networking** tab. You can configure networking for your new function app in the portal under **Settings** > **Networking**.

## Secure storage for an existing function app

When you have an existing function app, you can directly configure networking on the storage account being used by the app. However, this process results in your function app being down while you configure networking and while your function app restarts.

To minimize downtime, you can instead swap-out an existing storage account for a new, secured storage account.

### 1. Enable virtual network integration

As a prerequisite, you need to enable virtual network integration for your function app:

Choose a function app with a storage account that doesn't have service endpoints or private endpoints enabled.

[Enable virtual network integration](functions-networking-options#enable-virtual-network-integration)for your function app.

### 2. Create a secured storage account

Set up a secured storage account for your function app:

[Create a second storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create). This storage account is the secured storage account for your function app to use instead of its original unsecured storage account. You can also use an existing storage account not already being used by Functions.Save the connection string for this storage account to use later.

[Create a file share](../storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share#create-a-file-share)in the new storage account. For your convenience, you can use the same file share name from your original storage account. Otherwise, if you use a new file share name, you must update your app setting.Secure the new storage account in one of the following ways:

[Create a private endpoint](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#creating-a-private-endpoint). As you set up your private endpoint connection, create private endpoints for the`file`

,`blob`

and`table`

subresources. For Durable Functions, you must also make`queue`

subresources accessible through private endpoints. If you're using a custom or on-premises Domain Name System (DNS) server,[configure your DNS server](../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#dns-changes-for-private-endpoints)to resolve to the new private endpoints.[Restrict traffic to specific subnets](../storage/common/storage-network-security#grant-access-from-a-virtual-network). Ensure your function app is network integrated with an allowed subnet and that the subnet has only one of these service endpoints defined:`Microsoft.Storage`

: use when your app is in the same region as your virtual network.`Microsoft.Storage.Global`

: use when your app is in a different region than your virtual network.


Copy the file and blob content from the current storage account used by the function app to the newly secured storage account and file share.

[AzCopy](../storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs-copy)and[Azure Storage Explorer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/azure-tips-and-tricks-how-to-move-azure-storage-blobs-between/ba-p/3545304)are common methods. If you use Azure Storage Explorer, you might need to allow your client IP address access to your storage account's firewall.

Now you're ready to configure your function app to communicate with the newly secured storage account.

### 3. Enable application and configuration routing

Note

These configuration steps are required only for the [Elastic Premium](functions-premium-plan) and [Dedicated (App Service)](dedicated-plan) hosting plans.
The [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan) doesn't require site settings to configure networking.

You're now ready to route your function app's traffic to go through the virtual network:

Enable

[application routing](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#application-routing)to route your app's traffic to the virtual network:In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Networking**. In the**Networking**page, under**Outbound traffic configuration**, select the subnet associated with your virtual network integration.In the new page, under

**Application routing**, select**Outbound internet traffic**.

If your app uses an Azure Files share, enable

[content share routing](../app-service/overview-vnet-integration#content-share)by selecting**Content storage**under**Configuration routing**. This allows your app to communicate with Azure Files using the virtual network.

Note

You must take special care when routing to the content share in a storage account shared by multiple function apps in the same plan. For more information, see [Consistent routing through virtual networks](storage-considerations#consistent-routing-through-virtual-networks) in the Storage considerations article.

### 4. Update application settings

Finally, you need to update your application settings to point to the new secure storage account:

In your function app, expand

**Settings**, and then select**Environment variables**.In the

**App settings**tab, update the following settings by selecting each setting, editing it, and then selecting**Apply**:Setting name Value Comment `AzureWebJobsStorage`

Storage connection string Use the connection string for your new secured storage account, which you saved earlier. `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`

Storage connection string Use the connection string for your new secured storage account, which you saved earlier. Only relevant if your app is using Azure Files. `WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE`

File share Use the name of the file share created in the secured storage account where the project deployment files reside. Only relevant if your app is using Azure Files. Select

**Apply**, and then**Confirm**to save the new application settings in the function app. This causes the function app to restart.

After the function app finishes restarting, it connects to the secured storage account.

# Azure Functions scenarios

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Often, you build systems that react to a series of critical events. Whether you're building a web API, responding to database changes, or processing event streams or messages, you can use Azure Functions to implement these systems.

In many cases, a function [integrates with an array of cloud services](functions-triggers-bindings) to provide feature-rich implementations. The following list shows common (but by no means exhaustive) scenarios for Azure Functions.

Select your development language at the top of the article.

## Process file uploads

You can use functions in several ways to process files into or out of a blob storage container. To learn more about options for triggering on a blob container, see [Working with blobs](storage-considerations#working-with-blobs) in the best practices documentation.

For example, in a retail solution, a partner system can submit product catalog information as files into blob storage. You can use a blob triggered function to validate, transform, and process the files into the main system as you upload them.

The following tutorials use a Blob trigger (Event Grid based) to process files in a blob container:

For example, use the blob trigger with an event subscription on blob containers:

```
[FunctionName("ProcessCatalogData")]
public static async Task Run([BlobTrigger("catalog-uploads/{name}", Source = BlobTriggerSource.EventGrid, Connection = "<NAMED_STORAGE_CONNECTION>")] Stream myCatalogData, string name, ILogger log)
{
log.LogInformation($"C# Blob trigger function Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {myCatalogData.Length} Bytes");
using (var reader = new StreamReader(myCatalogData))
{
var catalogEntry = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
while(catalogEntry !=null)
{
// Process the catalog entry
// ...
catalogEntry = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
}
}
}
```

[Quickstart: Respond to blob storage events by using Azure Functions](scenario-blob-storage-events)[Sample: Blob trigger with the Event Grid source type quickstart sample)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart-javascript-azd-eventgrid-blob)[Tutorial (events): Trigger Azure Functions on blob containers using an event subscription](functions-event-grid-blob-trigger?pivots=programming-language-javascript)[Tutorial (polling): Upload and analyze a file with Azure Functions and Blob Storage](../storage/blobs/blob-upload-function-trigger-javascript)

## Real-time stream and event processing

Cloud applications, IoT devices, and networking devices generate and collect a large amount of telemetry. Azure Functions can process that data in near real-time as the hot path, then store it in [Azure Cosmos DB](/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) for use in an analytics dashboard.

Your functions can also use low-latency event triggers, like Event Grid, and real-time outputs like SignalR to process data in near-real-time.

For example, you can use the event hubs trigger to read from an event hub and the output binding to write to an event hub after debatching and transforming the events:

```
[FunctionName("ProcessorFunction")]
public static async Task Run(
[EventHubTrigger(
"%Input_EH_Name%",
Connection = "InputEventHubConnectionSetting",
ConsumerGroup = "%Input_EH_ConsumerGroup%")] EventData[] inputMessages,
[EventHub(
"%Output_EH_Name%",
Connection = "OutputEventHubConnectionSetting")] IAsyncCollector<SensorDataRecord> outputMessages,
PartitionContext partitionContext,
ILogger log)
{
var debatcher = new Debatcher(log);
var debatchedMessages = await debatcher.Debatch(inputMessages, partitionContext.PartitionId);
var xformer = new Transformer(log);
await xformer.Transform(debatchedMessages, partitionContext.PartitionId, outputMessages);

## Machine learning and AI

Azure Functions provides serverless compute resources that integrate with AI and Azure services to streamline building cloud-hosted intelligent applications. You can use the Functions programming model to create and host remote Model Content Protocol (MCP) servers and implement various AI tools. For more information, see [Tools and MCP servers](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps#tools-and-mcp-servers).

The [Azure OpenAI binding extension](functions-bindings-openai) lets you integrate AI features and behaviors of the [Azure OpenAI service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), into your function code executions. For more information, see [Retrieval-augmented generation](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps#retrieval-augmented-generation).

A function might also call a TensorFlow model or Azure AI services to process and classify a stream of images.

For more information, see [Use AI tools and models in Azure Functions](functions-create-ai-enabled-apps).

## Run scheduled tasks

Functions enables you to run your code based on a [cron schedule](functions-bindings-timer#usage) that you define.

See [Create a function in the Azure portal that runs on a schedule](functions-create-scheduled-function).

For example, you might analyze a financial services customer database for duplicate entries every 15 minutes to avoid multiple communications going out to the same customer.

For examples, see these code snippets:

```
[FunctionName("TimerTriggerCSharp")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("0 */15 * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer, ILogger log)
{
if (myTimer.IsPastDue)
{
log.LogInformation("Timer is running late!");
}
log.LogInformation($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
// Perform the database deduplication
}
```


## Build a scalable web API

An HTTP triggered function defines an HTTP endpoint. These endpoints run function code that can connect to other services directly or by using binding extensions. You can compose the endpoints into a web-based API.

You can also use an HTTP triggered function endpoint as a webhook integration, such as GitHub webhooks. In this way, you can create functions that process data from GitHub events. For more information, see [Monitor GitHub events by using a webhook with Azure Functions](/en-us/training/modules/monitor-github-events-with-a-function-triggered-by-a-webhook/).

For examples, see these code snippets:

```
[FunctionName("InsertName")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post")] HttpRequest req,
[CosmosDB(
databaseName: "my-database",
collectionName: "my-container",
ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDbConnectionString")]IAsyncCollector<dynamic> documentsOut,
ILogger log)
{
string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
string name = data?.name;
if (name == null)
{
return new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name in the request body json");
}
// Add a JSON document to the output container.
await documentsOut.AddAsync(new
{
// create a random ID
id = System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
name = name
});
return new OkResult();
}
```

## Build a serverless workflow

Functions often serve as the compute component in a serverless workflow topology, such as a Logic Apps workflow. You can also create long-running orchestrations by using the Durable Functions extension. For more information, see [Durable Functions overview](durable/durable-functions-overview).

## Respond to database changes

Some processes need to log, audit, or perform other operations when stored data changes. Functions triggers provide a good way to get notified of data changes to initial such an operation.

Consider these examples:

## Create reliable message systems

You can use Functions with Azure messaging services to create advanced event-driven messaging solutions.

For example, you can use triggers on Azure Storage queues as a way to chain together a series of function executions. Or use service bus queues and triggers for an online ordering system.

These articles show how to write output to a storage queue:

# Deployment technologies in Azure Functions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can use several different technologies to deploy your Azure Functions project code to Azure. This article provides an overview of the deployment methods available to you and recommendations for the best method to use in various scenarios. It also provides a comprehensive list of and key details about the underlying deployment technologies.

## Deployment methods

The deployment technology you use to publish code to your function app in Azure depends on your specific needs and the point in the development cycle. For example, during development and testing, you can deploy directly from your development tool, such as Visual Studio Code. When your app is in production, you're more likely to publish continuously from source control or by using an automated publishing pipeline, which can include validation and testing.

The following table describes the available deployment methods for your code project.

| Deployment type | Methods | Best for... |
|---|---|---|
| Tools-based | •
•
•
•
|

[local development tools](functions-develop-local#local-development-environments).[Deployment Center (CI/CD)](functions-continuous-deployment)•

[Container deployments](functions-how-to-custom-container#enable-continuous-deployment-to-azure)[Azure Pipelines](functions-how-to-azure-devops)•

[GitHub Actions](functions-how-to-github-actions)Use the best technology for your specific scenario. Many of the deployment methods are based on [zip deployment](#zip-deploy), which is recommended for deployment.

## Deployment technology availability

The deployment method also depends on the hosting plan and operating system on which you run your function app.

Currently, Functions offers five options for hosting your function apps:

[Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan)[Consumption](consumption-plan)[Elastic Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)[Azure Container Apps](../container-apps/functions-overview)

Each plan has different behaviors. Not all deployment technologies are available for each hosting plan and operating system. This chart provides information on the supported deployment technologies:

| Deployment technology | Flex Consumption | Consumption | Elastic Premium | Dedicated | Container Apps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|

[Zip deploy](#zip-deploy)[External package URL](#external-package-url)1[Docker container](#docker-container)[Source control](#source-control)[Local Git](#local-git)1[FTPS](#ftps)1[In-portal editing](#portal-editing)21 Deployment technologies that require you to [manually sync triggers](#trigger-syncing) aren't recommended.

2 In-portal editing is disabled when code is deployed to your function app from outside the portal. For more information, including language support details for in-portal editing, see [Language support details](supported-languages#language-support-details).

## Key concepts

Some key concepts are critical to understanding how deployments work in Azure Functions.

### Trigger syncing

When you change any of your triggers, the Functions infrastructure must be aware of the changes. Synchronization happens automatically for many deployment technologies. However, in some cases, you must manually sync your triggers.

You must always manually sync triggers when using these deployment options:

You can manually sync triggers in one of these ways:

Restart your function app in the Azure portal. The Functions host performs a background trigger sync after the application starts.

Use the

command to send an HTTP POST request that calls the`az rest`

`syncfunctiontriggers`

API, as in this example:`az rest --method post --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<APP_NAME>/syncfunctiontriggers?api-version=2016-08-01`


Keep these considerations in mind for the sync triggers operation:

- You must manually restart your function app any time you deploy an updated version of the deployment package by using the same external package URL.
- For apps running in a Consumption or Elastic Premium plan, you must also
[manually sync triggers](#trigger-syncing)in these scenarios:- When deployments use an external package URL with a resource manager-based deployment by using ARM templates or Bicep or Terraform files.
- When you update the deployment package
*in-place*by using the same external package URL.

- When you add network restrictions to an existing function app, you must guarantee connectivity to the default host storage account set in the
`AzureWebJobsStorage`

app setting. For more information, see[How to use a secured storage account with Azure Functions](configure-networking-how-to).

### Remote build

You can request Azure Functions to perform a remote build of your code project during deployment. In these scenarios, request a remote build instead of building locally:

- You're deploying an app to a Linux-based function app that you developed on a Windows computer. This situation is commonly the case for Python app development. You can end up with incorrect libraries when you build the deployment package locally on Windows.
- Your project has dependencies on a
[custom package index](python-build-options#remote-build-with-an-extra-index-url). - You want to reduce the size of your deployment package.

How you request a remote build depends on whether your app runs in Azure on Windows or Linux.

All function apps running on Windows have a small management app, the `scm`

site provided by [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu). This site handles much of the deployment and build logic for Azure Functions.

When you deploy an app to Windows, the deployment process runs language-specific commands, like `dotnet restore`

(C#) or `npm install`

(JavaScript).

The following considerations apply when using remote builds during deployment:

- Remote builds are supported for function apps running on Linux in the Consumption plan. However, deployment options are limited for these apps because they don't have an
`scm`

(Kudu) site. - Function apps running on Linux in a
[Premium plan](functions-premium-plan)or in a[Dedicated (App Service) plan](dedicated-plan)do have an`scm`

(Kudu) site, but it's limited compared to Windows. - Remote builds don't occur when an app uses
[run-from-package](run-functions-from-deployment-package). To learn how to use remote build in these cases, see[Zip deploy](#zip-deploy). - You might have issues with remote build when your app was created before the feature was made available (August 1, 2019). For older apps, either create a new function app or run
`az functionapp update --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --name <APP_NAME>`

to update your function app. This command might take two tries to succeed.

### App content storage

Package-based deployment methods store the package in the storage account associated with the function app, which the [AzureWebJobsStorage](functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) setting defines. When available, Consumption and Elastic Premium plan apps try to use the Azure Files content share from this account, but you can also maintain the package in another location. Flex Consumption plan apps use a storage container in default storage account, unless you [configure a different storage account to use for deployment](flex-consumption-how-to#configure-deployment-settings). For more information, review the details in **Where app content is stored** in each deployment technology covered in the next section.

Important

The storage account is used to store important app data, sometimes including the application code itself. You should limit access from other apps and users to the storage account.

## Deployment technology details

The following deployment methods are available in Azure Functions. To determine which technologies each hosting plan supports, refer to the [deployment technology availability](#deployment-technology-availability) table.

### One deploy

One deploy is the only deployment technology supported for apps on a [Flex Consumption plan](flex-consumption-plan). The end result is a ready-to-run .zip package that your function app runs on.


How to use it:Deploy by using the[Visual Studio Code]publish feature, or from the command line by using[Azure Functions Core Tools]or the[Azure CLI]. Our[Azure Dev Ops Task]and[GitHub Action]similarly leverage one deploy when they detect that a Flex Consumption app is being deployed to.When you create a Flex Consumption app, you must specify a deployment storage (blob) container as well as an authentication method to it. By default the same storage account as the

`AzureWebJobsStorage`

connection is used, with a connection string as the authentication method. Thus, your[deployment settings]are configured during app create time without any need of application settings.


When to use it:One deploy is the only deployment technology available for function apps running in a Flex Consumption plan.


Where app content is stored:When you create a Flex Consumption function app, you specify a[deployment storage container]. This blob container is where your tools upload the app content you deployed. To change the location, you can visit the Deployment Settings blade in the Azure portal or use the[Azure CLI].

Tip

A **Flex Function App deployment details** diagnostic tool is available in the Azure portal. Open your Flex Consumption app, select **Diagnose and solve problems**, and search for `Flex Function App deployment details`

. This tool displays detailed information about your deployments, including deployment history, package status, and troubleshooting recommendations.

### Zip deploy

Zip deploy is the default and recommended deployment technology for function apps on the Consumption, Elastic Premium, and App Service (Dedicated) plans. The end result is a ready-to-run .zip package that your function app runs on. It differs from [external package URL](#external-package-url) in that the platform is responsible for remote building and storing your app content.


How to use it:Deploy by using your favorite client tool:[Visual Studio Code],[Visual Studio], or from the command line using[Azure Functions Core Tools]or the[Azure CLI]. Our[Azure Dev Ops Task]and[GitHub Action]similarly leverage zip deploy.When you deploy by using zip deploy, you can set your app to

[run from package]. To run from package, set the[application setting value to]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

`1`

. We recommend zip deployment. It yields faster loading times for your applications, and it's the default for VS Code, Visual Studio, and the Azure CLI.


When to use it:Zip deploy is the default and recommended deployment technology for function apps on the Windows Consumption, Windows and Linux Elastic Premium, and Windows and Linux App Service (Dedicated) plans.


Where app content is stored:App content from a zip deploy is by default stored on the file system, which Azure might back by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app. In Linux Consumption, the app content is instead persisted on a blob in the storage account specified by the`AzureWebJobsStorage`

app setting, and the app setting`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

takes on the value of the blob URL.

### External package URL

External package URL is an option if you want to manually control how deployments are performed. You take responsibility for uploading a ready-to-run .zip package containing your built app content to blob storage and referencing this external URL as an application setting on your function app. Whenever your app restarts, it fetches the package, mounts it, and runs in [Run From Package](run-functions-from-deployment-package) mode.


How to use it:Add[to your application settings. The value of this setting should be a blob URL pointing to the location of the specific package you want your app to run. You can add settings either]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

[in the portal]or[by using the Azure CLI].If you use Azure Blob Storage, your Function app can access the container either by using a managed identity-based connection or with a

[shared access signature (SAS)]. The option you choose affects what kind of URL you use as the value for`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`

. Managed identity is recommended for overall security and because SAS tokens expire and must be manually maintained.Whenever you deploy the package file that a function app references, you must

[manually sync triggers], including the initial deployment. When you change the contents of the package file and not the URL itself, you must also restart your function app to sync triggers. Refer to our[how-to guide]on configuring this deployment technology.


When to use it:External package URL is the only supported deployment method for apps running on the Linux Consumption plan when you don't want a[remote build]to occur. This method is also the recommended deployment technology when you[create your app without Azure Files]. For scalable apps running on Linux, you should instead consider[Flex Consumption plan]hosting.


Where app content is stored:You are responsible for uploading your app content to blob storage. You may use any blob storage account, though Azure Blob Storage is recommended.

### Docker container

You can deploy a function app running in a Linux container.


How to use it:[Create your functions in a Linux container]then deploy the container to a Premium or Dedicated plan in Azure Functions or another container host. Use the[Azure Functions Core Tools]to create a customized Dockerfile for your project that you use to build a containerized function app. You can use the container in the following deployments:

- Deploy to Azure Functions resources you create in the Azure portal. For more information, see
[Azure portal create using containers].- Deploy to Azure Functions resources you create from the command line. Requires either a Premium or Dedicated (App Service) plan. To learn how, see
[Create your first containerized Azure Functions].- Deploy to Azure Container Apps. To learn how, see
[Create your first containerized Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps].- Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy to a cluster using
[Azure Functions Core Tools]. Use the[command.]`func kubernetes deploy`


When to use it:Use the Docker container option when you need more control over the Linux environment where your function app runs and where the container is hosted. This deployment mechanism is available only for functions running on Linux.


Where app content is stored:You store app content in the specified container registry as a part of the image.

### Source control

You can enable continuous integration between your function app and a source code repository. When you enable source control, an update to code in the connected source repository triggers deployment of the latest code from the repository. For more information, see the [Continuous deployment for Azure Functions](functions-continuous-deployment).


How to use it:The easiest way to set up publishing from source control is from the Deployment Center in the Functions area of the portal. For more information, see[Continuous deployment for Azure Functions].


When to use it:Using source control is the best practice for teams that collaborate on their function apps. Source control is a good deployment option that enables more sophisticated deployment pipelines. Usually, you enable source control on a staging slot, which you can swap into production after validation of updates from the repository. For more information, see[Azure Functions deployment slots].


Where app content is stored:The source control system stores the app content. The app file system stores a locally cloned and built app content form, which Azure Files from the storage account specified when the function app was created might back.

### Local Git

Use local Git to push code from your local machine to Azure Functions by using Git.


How to use it:Follow the instructions in[Local Git deployment to Azure App Service].


When to use it:To reduce the chance of errors, avoid using deployment methods that require the additional step of[manually syncing triggers]. Use[zip deployment]when possible.


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system, which might be backed by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app.

### FTP/S

You can use FTP/S to directly transfer files to Azure Functions, but don't use this deployment method. When you aren't planning on using FTP, disable it. If you choose to use FTP, enforce FTPS. To learn how in the Azure portal, see [Enforce FTPS](../app-service/deploy-ftp#enforce-ftps).


How to use it:Follow the instructions in[FTPS deployment settings]to get the URL and credentials you can use to deploy to your function app by using FTPS.


When to use it:To reduce the chance of errors, avoid using deployment methods that require the additional step of[manually syncing triggers]. Use[zip deployment]when possible.


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system. FTP/FTPS deployments fail when your app's file system is backed by Azure Files in the default host storage account. FTP/FTPS fails with Azure Files as mounted storage because of[FTP limitations].

### Portal editing

In the portal-based editor, you can directly edit the files that are in your function app (essentially deploying every time you save your changes).


How to use it:To edit your functions in the[Azure portal], you must[create your functions in the portal]. To preserve a single source of truth, using any other deployment method makes your function read-only and prevents continued portal editing. To return to a state in which you can edit your files in the Azure portal, you can manually turn the edit mode back to`Read/Write`

and remove any deployment-related application settings (like[).]`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`


When to use it:The portal is a good way to get started with Azure Functions. Because of[development limitations in the Azure portal], you should use one of the following client tools for more advanced development work:


Where app content is stored:App content is stored on the file system, which might be backed by Azure Files from the storage account you specify when creating the function app.

## Deployment behaviors

When you deploy updates to your function app code, the deployment behavior depends on your hosting plan:

**Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated plans:** Currently executing functions are terminated when new code is deployed. After deployment completes, the new code is loaded to begin processing requests. This forceful termination behavior is known as a recreate strategy. For near zero-downtime deployments on Consumption, Elastic Premium, and Dedicated plans, use [deployment slots](#deployment-slots).

Review [Improve the performance and reliability of Azure Functions](performance-reliability#write-functions-to-be-stateless) to learn how to write stateless and defensive functions.

**Flex Consumption plan:** The default behavior also uses the recreate strategy, terminating currently executing functions during deployment. However, Flex Consumption uniquely supports two different site update strategies. You can [configure rolling updates](flex-consumption-site-updates) for zero-downtime deployments.

## Deployment slots

When you deploy your function app to Azure, you can deploy to a separate deployment slot instead of directly to production. Deploying to a deployment slot and then swapping into production after verification is the recommended way to configure [continuous deployment](functions-continuous-deployment).

The way that you deploy to a slot depends on the specific deployment tool you use. For example, when using Azure Functions Core Tools, you include the `--slot`

option to indicate the name of a specific slot for the [ func azure functionapp publish](functions-core-tools-reference#func-azure-functionapp-publish) command.

For more information on deployment slots, see the [Azure Functions Deployment Slots](functions-deployment-slots) documentation.
