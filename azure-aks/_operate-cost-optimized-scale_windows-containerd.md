This article provides guidance on how to operate cost optimized Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at scale.

## Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)

[Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/overview) enables at-scale management of multiple AKS clusters. You can create a *Fleet resource* and use it to manage multiple clusters as a single entity, orchestrate updates across multiple clusters, and propagate Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters. When creating a new *Fleet resource*, you can create it with or without a *hub cluster*. A *hub cluster* is a managed AKS cluster that acts a hub to store and propagate Kubernetes resources.


Kubernetes Fleet can help you reduce the management overhead cost of operating multiple clusters by providing a single entry point for managing multiple clusters. For more information, see the [Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager documentation](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/).

### Resource propagation

Kubernetes Fleet provides *resource propagation* to enable at-scale management of Kubernetes resources. You can create Kubernetes resources in the *hub cluster* and propagate them to specified *member clusters* using the `MemberCluster`

and `ClusterResourcePlacement`

custom resources.


For more information, see [Kubernetes Fleet resource placement from hub cluster to member clusters](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-resource-propagation).

### Intelligent resource placement

Kubernetes Fleet provides *intelligent resource placement*, which can make scheduling decisions based on node count, cost of compute/memory in target member clusters, and resource availability in target member clusters. This allows you to place workloads in the most cost-effective member cluster based on your workload requirements.


For more information, see [Intelligent cross-cluster Kubernetes resource placement using Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/intelligent-resource-placement).

## AKS Automatic

[AKS Automatic](intro-aks-automatic) offers an experience that makes the most common tasks on Kubernetes fast and frictionless, while preserving the flexibility, extensibility, and consistency of Kubernetes. Azure takes care of cluster setup, including node management, scaling, and security, and preconfigures settings that follow AKS well-architected recommendations.

AKS Automatic clusters are designed to help reduce management overhead costs of creating cluster templates, managing the cluster lifecycle, guardrails, and updates. Scaling is seamless and dynamic. Nodes are created based on workload requests using [node autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision) and workloads are automatically scaled with features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), [Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](keda-about), and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

## Azure Advisor cost recommendations

AKS cost recommendations in Azure Advisor provide recommendations to help you achieve cost-efficiency without sacrificing reliability. Advisor analyzes your resource configurations and recommends optimization solutions. For more information, see [Get Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost recommendations in Azure Advisor](cost-advisors).

# Create Windows Server node pools with containerd in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

For Kubernetes version 1.20 and higher, you can specify [ containerd](https://containerd.io/) as the container runtime for Windows Server 2019 node pools. Starting with Kubernetes 1.23,

`containerd`

is the default and only container runtime for Windows.In this article, you learn how to create Windows Server node pools with `containerd`

in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)installed and configured. Find the version using the`az version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- An existing AKS cluster with a system node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool](create-node-pools#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli).

## Limitations and considerations

When using Windows Server node pools with `containerd`

, keep the following limitations and considerations in mind:

- Both the control plane and Windows Server 2019 node pools must use Kubernetes version 1.20 or greater.
- When you create or update a node pool to run Windows Server containers, the default value for
`--node-vm-size`

is`Standard_D2s_v3`

, which was the minimum recommended size for Windows Server 2019 node pools up to Kubernetes version 1.20. The minimum recommended size for Windows Server 2019 node pools using`containerd`

is`Standard_D4s_v3`

. When setting the`--node-vm-size`

parameter, check the[list of restricted virtual machine (VM) sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview). - We recommend using
[taints or labels](manage-node-pools#set-node-pool-taints)with your Windows Server 2019 node pools running`containerd`

and tolerations or node selectors with your deployments to guarantee your workloads are scheduled correctly.

## Add a Windows Server node pool with `containerd`


Add a Windows Server node pool with

`containerd`

into your existing cluster using the [`az aks nodepool add`

][az-aks-nodepool-add].Note

If you don't specify the

`WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`

custom header, the node pool still uses`containerd`

as the container runtime by default.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --os-type Windows \ --name $CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3 \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.5 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd \ --node-count 1`


## Upgrade an existing Windows Server node pool to `containerd`


Upgrade a specific node pool from Docker to

`containerd`

using the [`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`export CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME="mywindowsnodepool" az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.7 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`


## Upgrade all existing Windows Server node pools to `containerd`


Upgrade all node pools from Docker to

`containerd`

using the [`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.7 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`
