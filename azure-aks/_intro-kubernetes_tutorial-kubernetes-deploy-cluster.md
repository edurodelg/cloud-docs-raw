Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

This article is intended for platform administrators or developers who are looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

Note

AKS is [CNCF-certified](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) and is compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure compliance overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/compliance/).

## Container solutions in Azure

Azure offers a range of container solutions designed to accommodate various workloads, architectures, and business needs.

# Tutorial - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can quickly create a production ready Kubernetes cluster.

In this tutorial, you deploy a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learn how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you created a container image and uploaded it to an ACR instance. Start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app) to follow along.

- If you're using Azure CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with
`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this tutorial requires that you're running Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Check your version with
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - If you're using Azure Developer CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure Developer CLI version 1.5.1 or later. Check your version with
`azd version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure Developer CLI](/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. If a user is assigned multiple roles, permissions are combined. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster.

To learn more about AKS and Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with `az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're using the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Install the Kubernetes CLI

You use the Kubernetes CLI, [ kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed. If you're running the commands locally, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to install `kubectl`

.Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`


## Create an AKS cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. Permissions are combined when users are assigned multiple roles. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster. For more information, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

For information about AKS resource limits and region availability, see [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions).

Important

This tutorial creates a three-node cluster. To ensure your cluster operates reliably, you should run at least two nodes. A minimum of three nodes is required to use Azure Container Storage. If you get an error message when trying to create the cluster, then you might need to request a quota increase for your Azure subscription or try a different Azure region. Alternatively, you can omit the node VM size parameter to use the default VM size.

To allow an AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources, the Azure platform automatically creates a cluster identity. In this example, the cluster identity is [granted the right to pull images](cluster-container-registry-integration) from the ACR instance you created in the previous tutorial. To execute the command successfully, you must have an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role in your Azure subscription.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a cluster named`az aks create`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*. This resource group was created in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr)in the*westus2*region. We'll continue to use the environment variable,`$ACRNAME`

, that we set in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr). If you don't have this environment variable set, set it now to the same value you used previously.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size standard_l8s_v3 \ --generate-ssh-keys \ --attach-acr $ACRNAME`

Note

If you already generated SSH keys, you might encounter an error similar to

`linuxProfile.ssh.publicKeys.keyData is invalid`

. To proceed, retry the command without the`--generate-ssh-keys`

parameter.

To avoid needing an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role, you can also manually configure a service principal to pull images from ACR. For more information, see [ACR authentication with service principals](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal) or [Authenticate from Kubernetes with a pull secret](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes). Alternatively, you can use a [managed identity](use-managed-identity) instead of a service principal for easier management.

## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the AKS cluster named`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in*myResourceGroup*.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify connection to your cluster using the

command, which returns a list of cluster nodes.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the cluster nodes:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000000 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000001 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000002 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9`


## Next step

In this tutorial, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster in AKS and configured `kubectl`

to connect to the cluster. You learned how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an ACR.
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to deploy Azure Container Storage on your cluster and create a generic ephemeral volume. If you're using Azure Developer CLI, or if you weren't able to use a storage optimized VM type due to quota issues, proceed directly to the [Deploy containerized application](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-application) tutorial.
