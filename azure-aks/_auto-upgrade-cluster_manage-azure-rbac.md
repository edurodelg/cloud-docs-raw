Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Part of the AKS cluster lifecycle involves performing periodic upgrades to the latest Kubernetes version. It's important you apply the latest security releases or upgrade to get the latest features. Before you learn about automatic upgrades, make sure you understand the [AKS cluster upgrade fundamentals](upgrade-cluster).

Note

Any upgrade operation, whether performed manually or automatically, upgrades the node image version if it's not already on the latest version. The latest version is contingent on a full AKS release and can be determined by visiting the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Autoupgrade first upgrades the control plane, and then upgrades agent pools one by one.

## Why use cluster autoupgrade

Cluster autoupgrade provides a *set once and forget* mechanism that yields tangible time and operational cost benefits. You don't need to stop your workloads, redeploy your workloads, or create a new AKS cluster. By enabling autoupgrade, you can ensure your clusters are up to date and don't miss the latest features or patches from AKS and upstream Kubernetes.

AKS follows a strict supportability versioning window. With properly selected autoupgrade channels, you can avoid clusters falling into an unsupported version. For more on the AKS support window, see [Alias minor versions](supported-kubernetes-versions).

## Customer versus AKS-initiated autoupgrades

You can specify cluster autoupgrade specifics using the following guidance. The upgrades occur based on your specified cadence and are recommended to remain on supported Kubernetes versions.

AKS also initiates autoupgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where n is the latest supported AKS GA minor version) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support [policy](supported-kubernetes-versions). Automatically upgrading a platform supported cluster to a supported version is enabled by default. Stopped node pools are upgraded during an autoupgrade operation. The upgrade applies to nodes when the node pool is started. To minimize disruptions, set up [maintenance windows](planned-maintenance).

## Cluster autoupgrade limitations

If you're using cluster autoupgrade, you can no longer upgrade the control plane first, and then upgrade the individual node pools. Cluster autoupgrade always upgrades the control plane and the node pools together. You can't upgrade the control plane only. Running the `az aks upgrade --control-plane-only`

command raises the following error:

```
NotAllAgentPoolOrchestratorVersionSpecifiedAndUnchanged: Using managed cluster api, all Agent pools' OrchestratorVersion must be all specified or all unspecified. If all specified, they must be stay unchanged or the same with control plane.
```


If using the `node-image`

(legacy and not to be used) cluster autoupgrade channel or the `NodeImage`

node image autoupgrade channel, Linux [unattended upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates) are disabled by default.

## Cluster autoupgrade channels

Automatically completed upgrades are functionally the same as manual upgrades. The [selected autoupgrade channel](planned-maintenance) determines the timing of upgrades. When making changes to autoupgrade, allow 24 hours for the changes to take effect. Automatically upgrading a cluster follows the same process as manually upgrading a cluster. For more information, see [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster).

The following upgrade channels are available:

| Channel | Action | Example |
|---|---|---|
`none` |
disables autoupgrades and keeps the cluster at its current version of Kubernetes. | Default setting if left unchanged. |
`patch` |
automatically upgrades the cluster to the latest supported patch version when it becomes available while keeping the minor version the same. | For example, if a cluster runs version 1.17.7, and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, the cluster upgrades to 1.17.9. |
`stable` |
automatically upgrades the cluster to the latest supported patch release on minor version N-1, where N is the latest supported minor version. |
For example, if a cluster runs version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, the cluster upgrades to 1.18.6. |
`rapid` |
automatically upgrades the cluster to the latest supported patch release on the latest supported minor version. | In cases where the cluster's Kubernetes version is an N-2 minor version, where N is the latest supported minor version, the cluster first upgrades to the latest supported patch version on N-1 minor version. For example, if a cluster runs version 1.17.7 and versions 1.17.9, 1.18.4, 1.18.6, and 1.19.1 are available, the cluster first upgrades to 1.18.6, then upgrades to 1.19.1. |
`node-image` (legacy) |
automatically upgrades the node image to the latest version available. | Microsoft provides patches and new images for image nodes frequently (weekly), but your running nodes don't get the new images unless you do a node image upgrade. Turning on the node-image channel automatically updates your node images whenever a new version is available. If you use this channel, Linux [unattended upgrades] are disabled by default. Node image upgrades work on patch versions that are deprecated, so long as the minor Kubernetes version is still supported. This channel is no longer recommended and is planned for deprecation in future. For an option that can automatically upgrade node images, see the `NodeImage` channel in
|

Note

Keep the following information in mind when using cluster autoupgrade:

Cluster autoupgrade only updates to GA versions of Kubernetes and doesn't update to preview versions.

With AKS, you can create a cluster without specifying the exact patch version. When you create a cluster without designating a patch, the cluster runs the minor version's latest GA patch. To learn more, see

[AKS support window](supported-kubernetes-versions).Autoupgrade requires the cluster's Kubernetes version to be within the

[AKS support window](supported-kubernetes-versions), even if using the`node-image`

channel.If you're using the preview API

`11-02-preview`

or later, and you select the`node-image`

cluster autoupgrade channel, the[node image autoupgrade channel](auto-upgrade-node-image)automatically sets to`NodeImage`

.Each cluster can only be associated with a single autoupgrade channel. The reason is because your specified channel determines the Kubernetes version that runs on the cluster.

If your cluster has no autoupgrade channel and you enable it for Long-Term Support (LTS), the cluster defaults to a

`patch`

autoupgrade channel.

## Use cluster autoupgrade with a new AKS cluster

Set the autoupgrade channel when creating a new cluster using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and the

`auto-upgrade-channel`

parameter.```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster"
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --auto-upgrade-channel stable --generate-ssh-keys
```


## Use cluster autoupgrade with an existing AKS cluster

Set the autoupgrade channel on an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`auto-upgrade-channel`

parameter.```
az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --auto-upgrade-channel stable
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa6a6a-bb7b-cc8c-dd9d-eeeeee0e0e0e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupabc123/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster",
"properties": {
"autoUpgradeChannel": "stable",
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
}
}
```


## Use autoupgrade with Planned Maintenance

If using Planned Maintenance and cluster autoupgrade, your upgrade starts during your specified maintenance window.

Note

To ensure proper functionality, use a maintenance window of *four hours or more*.

For more information on how to set a maintenance window with Planned Maintenance, see [Use Planned Maintenance to schedule maintenance windows for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](planned-maintenance).

## Best practices for cluster autoupgrade

Use the following best practices to help maximize your success when using autoupgrade:

- To ensure your cluster is always in a supported version, for example within the N-2 rule, choose either
`stable`

or`rapid`

channels. - If you're interested in getting the latest patches as soon as possible, use the
`patch`

channel. The`node-image`

channel is a good fit if you want your agent pools to always run the most recent node images. - To automatically upgrade node images while using a different cluster upgrade channel, consider using the
[node image autoupgrade](auto-upgrade-node-image)`NodeImage`

channel. - Follow
[Operator best practices](operator-best-practices-scheduler#plan-for-availability-using-pod-disruption-budgets). - Follow
[PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/). - For upgrade troubleshooting information, see the
[AKS troubleshooting documentation](/en-us/support/azure/azure-kubernetes/welcome-azure-kubernetes).

For a detailed discussion of upgrade best practices and other considerations, see [AKS patch and upgrade guidance](/en-us/azure/architecture/operator-guides/aks/aks-upgrade-practices).

# Use Azure role-based access control for Kubernetes Authorization

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article covers how to use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization, which allows for the unified management and access control across Azure resources, AKS, and Kubernetes resources. For more information, see [Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization](/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-rbac-for-kubernetes-authorization).

Note

When using [integrated authentication between Microsoft Entra ID and AKS](managed-azure-ad), you can use Microsoft Entra users, groups, or service principals as subjects in [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-rbac-for-kubernetes-authorization). With this feature, you don't need to separately manage user identities and credentials for Kubernetes. However, you still need to set up and manage Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC separately.

## Before you begin

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.24.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need
`kubectl`

, with a minimum version of[1.18.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1183). - You need managed Microsoft Entra integration enabled on your cluster before you can add Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization. If you need to enable managed Microsoft Entra integration, see
[Use Microsoft Entra ID in AKS](managed-azure-ad). - If you have CRDs and are making custom role definitions, the only way to cover CRDs today is to use
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/*/read`

. For the remaining objects, you can use the specific API groups, such as`Microsoft.ContainerService/apps/deployments/read`

. - New role assignments can take
*up to five minutes*to propagate and be updated by the authorization server. - Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization requires that the Microsoft Entra tenant configured for authentication is same as the tenant for the subscription that holds your AKS cluster.

## Create a new AKS cluster with managed Microsoft Entra integration and Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name> export LOCATION=<azure-region> az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster with managed Microsoft Entra integration and Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization using the

command.`az aks create`

`export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster-name> az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-aad \ --enable-azure-rbac \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`"AADProfile": { "adminGroupObjectIds": null, "clientAppId": null, "enableAzureRbac": true, "managed": true, "serverAppId": null, "serverAppSecret": null, "tenantId": "****-****-****-****-****" }`


## Enable Azure RBAC on an existing AKS cluster

Enable Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac`


## Disable Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization from an AKS cluster

Remove Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization from an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-rbac`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --disable-azure-rbac`


## AKS built-in roles

AKS provides the following built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader | Allows read-only access to see most objects in a namespace. It doesn't allow viewing roles or role bindings. This role doesn't allow viewing `Secrets` , since reading the contents of Secrets enables access to ServiceAccount credentials in the namespace, which would allow API access as any ServiceAccount in the namespace (a form of privilege escalation). |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer | Allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace. This role doesn't allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing `Secrets` and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin | Allows admin access, intended to be granted within a namespace. Allows read/write access to most resources in a namespace (or cluster scope), including the ability to create roles and role bindings within the namespace. This role doesn't allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace itself. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin | Allows super-user access to perform any action on any resource. It gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. |

## Create role assignments for cluster access

Get your AKS resource ID using the

command.`az aks show`

`AKS_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --query id --output tsv)`

Create a role assignment using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`<AAD-ENTITY-ID>`

can be a username or the client ID of a service principal. The following example creates a role assignment for the*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin*role.`az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID`

Note

You can create the

*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader*and*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer*role assignments scoped to a specific namespace within the cluster using thecommand and setting the scope to the desired namespace.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID/namespaces/<namespace-name>`


## Create custom roles definitions

The following example custom role definition allows a user to only read deployments and nothing else. For the full list of possible actions, see [Microsoft.ContainerService operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftcontainerservice).

To create your own custom role definitions, copy the following file, replacing

`<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>`

with your own subscription ID, and then save it as`deploy-view.json`

.`{ "Name": "AKS Deployment Reader", "Description": "Lets you view all deployments in cluster/namespace.", "Actions": [], "NotActions": [], "DataActions": [ "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/read" ], "NotDataActions": [], "assignableScopes": [ "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>" ] }`

Create the role definition using the

command, setting the`az role definition create`

`--role-definition`

to the`deploy-view.json`

file you created in the previous step.`az role definition create --role-definition @deploy-view.json`

Assign the role definition to a user or other identity using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "AKS Deployment Reader" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID`


## Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization with `kubectl`


Make sure you have the

[Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-user-role)built-in role, and then get the kubeconfig of your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`

You can now use

`kubectl`

to manage your cluster. For example, you can list the nodes in your cluster using`kubectl get nodes`

.`kubectl get nodes`

Example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11`


## Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization with `kubelogin`


AKS created the [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) plugin to help unblock scenarios such as non-interactive logins, older

`kubectl`

versions, or leveraging SSO across multiple clusters without the need to sign in to a new cluster.Use the

`kubelogin`

plugin by running the following command:`export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig kubelogin convert-kubeconfig`

You can now use

`kubectl`

to manage your cluster. For example, you can list the nodes in your cluster using`kubectl get nodes`

.`kubectl get nodes`

Example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11`


## Clean up resources

### Delete role assignment

List role assignments using the

command.`az role assignment list`

`az role assignment list --scope $AKS_ID --query [].id --output tsv`

Delete role assignments using the

command.`az role assignment delete`

`az role assignment delete --ids <LIST OF ASSIGNMENT IDS>`


### Delete role definition

Delete the custom role definition using the

command.`az role definition delete`

`az role definition delete --name "AKS Deployment Reader"`


### Delete resource group and AKS cluster

Delete the resource group and AKS cluster using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes --no-wait`
