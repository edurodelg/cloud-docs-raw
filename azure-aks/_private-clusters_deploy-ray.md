Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article helps you deploy a private link-based AKS cluster. If you're interested in creating an AKS cluster without required private link or tunnel, see [Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with API Server VNet integration](api-server-vnet-integration).

## Overview of private clusters in AKS

In a private cluster, the control plane or API server has internal IP addresses that are defined in the [RFC1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internet](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) document. By using a private cluster, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains only on the private network.

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure resource group, and your cluster or node pool is in your resource group. The server and the cluster or node pool can communicate with each other through the [Azure Private Link service](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#limitations) in the API server virtual network and a private endpoint exposed on the subnet of your AKS cluster.

When you create a private AKS cluster, AKS creates both private and public fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) with corresponding DNS zones by default. For detailed DNS configuration options, see [Configure a private DNS zone, private DNS subzone, or custom subdomain](#configure-a-private-dns-zone-private-dns-subzone-or-custom-subdomain-for-a-private-aks-cluster).

## Region availability

Private clusters are available in public regions, Azure Government, and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet regions where [AKS is supported](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).

Important

All Microsoft Defender for Cloud features will be officially retired in the Azure in China region on August 18, 2026. Due to this upcoming retirement, Azure in China customers are no longer able to onboard new subscriptions to the service. A new subscription is any subscription that was not already onboarded to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service prior to August 18, 2025, the date of the retirement announcement. For more information on the retirement, see [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Deprecation in Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Announcement](https://aka.ms/mdcretirementinchina).

Customers should work with their account representatives for Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet to assess the impact of this retirement on their own operations.

## Prerequisites for private AKS clusters

- The Azure CLI version 2.28.0 or higher. Run
`az --version`

to find the version, and run`az upgrade`

to upgrade the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) or the Azure REST API, the AKS API version must be
*2021-05-01 or higher*. - To use a custom DNS server, add the Azure public IP address
*168.63.129.16*as the upstream DNS server in the custom DNS server, and make sure to add this public IP address as the*first*DNS server. For more information about the Azure IP address, see[What is IP address 168.63.129.16?](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/what-is-ip-address-168-63-129-16)- The cluster's DNS zone should be what you forward to
*168.63.129.16*. You can find more information on zone names in[Azure services DNS zone configuration](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-dns#azure-services-dns-zone-configuration).

- The cluster's DNS zone should be what you forward to
- Existing AKS clusters enabled with API Server VNet integration can have private cluster mode enabled. For more information, see
[Enable or disable private cluster mode on an existing cluster with API Server VNet integration](api-server-vnet-integration#enable-or-disable-private-cluster-mode-on-an-existing-cluster-with-api-server-vnet-integration).

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Limitations and considerations for private AKS clusters

- You can't apply IP authorized ranges to the private API server endpoint - they only apply to the public API server.
[Azure Private Link service limitations](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#limitations)apply to private clusters.- There's no support for Azure DevOps Microsoft-hosted Agents with private clusters. Consider using
[self-hosted agents](/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents). - If you need to enable Azure Container Registry on a private AKS cluster,
[set up a private link for the container registry in the cluster virtual network (VNet)](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-private-link)or set up peering between the container registry's virtual network and the private cluster's virtual network. - Deleting or modifying the private endpoint in the customer subnet causes the cluster to stop functioning.
- Azure Private Link service is supported on Standard Azure Load Balancer only. Basic Azure Load Balancer isn't supported.

## Hub and spoke with custom DNS for private AKS clusters

[Hub and spoke architectures](/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) are commonly used to deploy networks in Azure. In many of these deployments, DNS settings in the spoke VNets are configured to reference a central DNS forwarder to allow for on-premises and Azure-based DNS resolution.

Keep the following considerations in mind when deploying private AKS clusters in hub and spoke architectures with custom DNS:

When a private cluster is created, a private endpoint (1) and a private DNS zone (2) are created in the cluster-managed resource group by default. The cluster uses an

`A`

record in the private zone to resolve the IP of the private endpoint for communication to the API server.The private DNS zone is linked only to the VNet that the cluster nodes are attached to (3), which means that the private endpoint can only be resolved by hosts in that linked VNet. In scenarios where no custom DNS is configured on the VNet (default), it works without issue as hosts point at

*168.63.129.16*for DNS that can resolve records in the private DNS zone because of the link.If you keep the default private DNS zone behavior, AKS tries to link the zone directly to the spoke VNet that hosts the cluster even when the zone is already linked to a hub VNet.

In spoke VNets that use custom DNS servers, this action can fail if the cluster's managed identity lacks

**Network Contributor**on the spoke VNet.To prevent the failure, choose

**one**of the following supported configurations:**Custom private DNS zone**: Provide a precreated private zone and set`privateDNSZone`

/`--private-dns-zone`

to its resource ID. Link that zone to the appropriate VNet (for example, the hub VNet) and set`publicDNS`

to`false`

/ use`--disable-public-fqdn`

.**Public DNS only**: Disable private zone creation by setting`privateDNSZone`

/`--private-dns-zone`

to`none`

**and**leave`publicDNS`

at its default value (`true`

) / don't use`--disable-public-fqdn`

.

If you're using

[bring your own (BYO) route table with kubenet](configure-kubenet#bring-your-own-subnet-and-route-table-with-kubenet)and BYO DNS with private clusters, cluster creation fails. You need to associate thein the node resource group to the subnet after the cluster creation failed to make the creation successful.`RouteTable`


Keep the following limitations in mind when using custom DNS with private AKS clusters:

- Setting
`privateDNSZone`

/`--private-dns-zone`

to`none`

**and**`publicDNS: false`

/`--disable-public-fqdn`

at the same time**isn't supported**. - Conditional forwarding doesn't support subdomains.

## Create a private AKS cluster with default basic networking

Create a resource group using the

command. You can also use an existing resource group for your AKS cluster.`az group create`

`az group create \ --name <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --location <location>`

Create a private cluster with default basic networking using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-private-cluster`

flag.**Key parameters in this command**:`--enable-private-cluster`

: Enables private cluster mode.

`az aks create \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-private-cluster \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with advanced networking

command. You can also use an existing resource group for your AKS cluster.`az group create`

`az group create \ --name <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --location <location>`

Create a private cluster with advanced networking using the

command.`az aks create`

**Key parameters in this command**:`--enable-private-cluster`

: Enables private cluster mode.`--network-plugin azure`

: Specifies the Azure CNI networking plugin.`--vnet-subnet-id`

: The resource ID of an existing subnet in a virtual network.`--dns-service-ip`

: An available IP address within the Kubernetes service address range to use for the cluster DNS service.`--service-cidr`

: A CIDR notation IP range from which to assign service cluster IPs.

`az aks create \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-private-cluster \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id <subnet-id> \ --dns-service-ip 10.2.0.10 \ --service-cidr 10.2.0.0/24 --generate-ssh-keys`


## Use custom domains with private AKS clusters

If you want to configure custom domains that can only be resolved internally, see [Use custom domains](coredns-custom#use-custom-domains).

## Disable a public FQDN on a private AKS cluster

### Disable a public FQDN on a new cluster

Disable a public FQDN when creating a private AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--disable-public-fqdn`

flag.`az aks create \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-private-cluster \ --assign-identity <resource-id> \ --private-dns-zone <private-dns-zone-mode> \ --disable-public-fqdn \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Disable a public FQDN on an existing cluster

Disable a public FQDN on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-public-fqdn`

flag.`az aks update \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --disable-public-fqdn`


## Configure a private DNS zone, private DNS subzone, or custom subdomain for a private AKS cluster

You can configure private DNS settings for a private AKS cluster using the Azure CLI (with the `--private-dns-zone`

parameter) or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template (with the `privateDNSZone`

property). The following table outlines the options available for the `--private-dns-zone`

parameter / `privateDNSZone`

property:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
`system` |
The default value when configuring a private DNS zone. If you omit `--private-dns-zone` / `privateDNSZone` , AKS creates a private DNS zone in the node resource group. |
`none` |
If you set `--private-dns-zone` / `privateDNSZone` to `none` , AKS doesn't create a private DNS zone. |
`<custom-private-dns-zone-resource-id>` |
To use this parameter, you need to create a private DNS zone in the following format for Azure global cloud: `privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io` or `<subzone>.privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io` . You need the resource ID of the private DNS zone for future use. You also need a user-assigned identity or service principal with the
`private.<region>.azmk8s.io` or `<subzone>.private.<region>.azmk8s.io` . You can't change or delete this resource after creating the cluster, as it can cause performance issues and cluster upgrade failures. You can use `--fqdn-subdomain <subdomain>` with `<custom-private-dns-zone-resource-id>` only to provide subdomain capabilities to `privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io` . If you're specifying a subzone, there's a 32 character limit for the `<subzone>` name. |

Keep the following considerations in mind when configuring private DNS for a private AKS cluster:

- If the private DNS zone is in a different subscription than the AKS cluster, you need to register the
`Microsoft.ContainerServices`

Azure provider in both subscriptions. - If your AKS cluster is configured with an Active Directory service principal, AKS doesn't support using a system-assigned managed identity with custom private DNS zone. The cluster must use
[user-assigned managed identity authentication](use-managed-identity).

## Create a private AKS cluster with a private DNS zone

Create a private AKS cluster with a private DNS zone using the

command.`az aks create`

**Key parameters in this command**:`--enable-private-cluster`

: Enables private cluster mode.`--private-dns-zone [system|none]`

: Configures the private DNS zone for the cluster. The default value is`system`

.`--assign-identity <resource-id>`

: The resource ID of a user-assigned managed identity with the[Private DNS Zone Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#dns-zone-contributor)and[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)roles.

`az aks create \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-private-cluster \ --assign-identity <resource-id> \ --private-dns-zone [system|none] \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with a custom private DNS zone or private DNS subzone

Create a private AKS cluster with a custom private DNS zone or subzone using the

command.`az aks create`

**Key parameters in this command**:`--enable-private-cluster`

: Enables private cluster mode.`--private-dns-zone <custom-private-dns-zone-resource-id>|<custom-private-dns-subzone-resource-id>`

: The resource ID of a precreated private DNS zone or subzone in the following format for Azure global cloud:`privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io`

or`<subzone>.privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io`

.`--assign-identity <resource-id>`

: The resource ID of a user-assigned managed identity with the[Private DNS Zone Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#dns-zone-contributor)and[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)roles.

`# The custom private DNS zone name should be in the following format: "<subzone>.privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io" az aks create \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-private-cluster \ --assign-identity <resource-id> \ --private-dns-zone [<custom-private-dns-zone-resource-id>|<custom-private-dns-subzone-resource-id>] \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with a custom private DNS zone and custom subdomain

Create a private AKS cluster with a custom private DNS zone and subdomain using the

command.`az aks create`

**Key parameters in this command**:`--enable-private-cluster`

: Enables private cluster mode.`--private-dns-zone <custom-private-dns-zone-resource-id>`

## Update an existing private AKS cluster from a private DNS zone to public

You can only update from `byo`

(bring your own) or `system`

to `none`

. No other combination of update values is supported.

Warning

When you update a private cluster from `byo`

or `system`

to `none`

, the agent nodes change to use a public FQDN. In an AKS cluster that uses Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, a [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) is performed to update your nodes with the public FQDN.

Update a private cluster from

`byo`

or`system`

to`none`

using thecommand with the`az aks update`

`--private-dns-zone`

parameter set to`none`

.`az aks update \ --name <private-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> \ --private-dns-zone none`


## Configure kubectl to connect to a private AKS cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell. To install `kubectl`

locally, use the [ az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <private-cluster-resource-group> --name <private-cluster-name>`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The command returns output similar to the following example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11`

# Configure and deploy a Ray cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you configure and deploy a Ray cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using KubeRay. You also learn how to use the Ray cluster to train a simple machine learning model and display the results on the Ray Dashboard.

This article provides two methods to deploy the Ray cluster on AKS:

: Use the[Non-interactive deployment](#deploy-the-ray-sample-non-interactively)`deploy.sh`

script in the GitHub repository to deploy the complete Ray sample non-interactively.: Follow the manual deployment steps to deploy the Ray sample to AKS.[Manual deployment](#manually-deploy-the-ray-sample)

## Prerequisites

- Review the
[Ray cluster on AKS overview](ray-overview)to understand the components and deployment process. - An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a free account
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The Azure CLI installed on your local machine. You can install it using the instructions in
[How to install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The
[Azure Kubernetes Service Preview extension](/en-us/azure/aks/draft#install-the-aks-preview-azure-cli-extension)installed. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.[Terraform client tools](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)or[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/)installed. This article uses Terraform, but the modules used should be compatible with OpenTofu.

## Deploy the Ray sample non-interactively

If you want to deploy the complete Ray sample non-interactively, you can use the `deploy.sh`

script in the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-ray-sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-ray-sample)). This script completes the steps outlined in the [Ray deployment process section](ray-overview#ray-deployment-process).

Clone the GitHub repo locally and change to the root of the repo using the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-ray-sample cd aks-ray-sample`

Deploy the complete sample using the following commands:

`chmod +x deploy.sh ./deploy.sh`

Once the deployment completes, review the output of the logs and the resource group in the Azure portal to see the infrastructure that was created.


## Manually deploy the Ray sample

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from ten classes. In this guide, you train a simple PyTorch model on this dataset using the Ray cluster.

### Deploy the RayJob specification

To train the model, you need to submit a Ray Job specification to the KubeRay operator running on a private AKS cluster. The Ray Job specification is a YAML file that describes the resources required to run the job, including the Docker image, the command to run, and the number of workers to use.

Looking at the Ray Job description, you might need to modify some fields to match your environment:

- The
`replicas`

field under the`workerGroupSpecs`

section in`rayClusterSpec`

specifies the number of worker pods that KubeRay schedules to the Kubernetes cluster. Each worker pod requires*3 CPUs*and*4 GB of memory*. The head pod requires*1 CPU*and*4 GB of memory*. Setting the`replicas`

field to*2*requires*8 vCPUs*in the node pool used to implement the RayCluster for the job. - The
`NUM_WORKERS`

field under`runtimeEnvYAML`

in`spec`

specifies the number of Ray actors to launch. Each Ray actor must be serviced by a worker pod in the Kubernetes cluster, so this field must be less than or equal to the`replicas`

field. In this example, we set`NUM_WORKERS`

to*2*, which matches the`replicas`

field. - The
`CPUS_PER_WORKER`

field must be set to*less than or equal the number of CPUs allocated to each worker pod minus 1*. In this example, the CPU resource request per worker pod is*3*, so`CPUS_PER_WORKER`

is set to*2*.

To summarize, you need a total of *8 vCPUs* in the node pool to run the PyTorch model training job. Since we added a taint on the system node pool so that no user pods can be scheduled on it, we must create a new node pool with at least *8 vCPUs* to host the Ray cluster.

Download the Ray Job specification file using the following command:

`curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/kuberay/master/ray-operator/config/samples/pytorch-mnist/ray-job.pytorch-mnist.yaml`

Make any necessary modifications to the Ray Job specification file.

Launch the PyTorch model training job using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -n kuberay -f ray-job.pytorch-mnist.yaml`


### Verify the RayJob deployment

Verify that you have two worker pods and one head pod running in the namespace using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -n kuberay`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kuberay-operator-7d7998bcdb-9h8hx 1/1 Running 0 3d2h pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-worker-small-group-knpgl 1/1 Running 0 6m15s pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-worker-small-group-p74cm 1/1 Running 0 6m15s rayjob-pytorch-mnist-fc959 1/1 Running 0 5m35s rayjob-pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-head-l24hn 1/1 Running 0 6m15s`

Check the status of the RayJob using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get rayjob -n kuberay`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME JOB STATUS DEPLOYMENT STATUS START TIME END TIME AGE rayjob-pytorch-mnist RUNNING Running 2024-11-22T03:08:22Z 9m36s`

Wait until the RayJob completes. This might take a few minutes. Once the

`JOB STATUS`

is`SUCCEEDED`

, you can check the training logs. You can do this by first getting the name of the pod running the RayJob using the`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -n kuberay`

In the output, you should see a pod with a name that starts with

`rayjob-pytorch-mnist`

, similar to the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kuberay-operator-7d7998bcdb-9h8hx 1/1 Running 0 3d2h pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-worker-small-group-knpgl 1/1 Running 0 14m pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-worker-small-group-p74cm 1/1 Running 0 14m rayjob-pytorch-mnist-fc959 0/1 Completed 0 13m rayjob-pytorch-mnist-raycluster-s7xd9-head-l24hn 1/1 Running 0 14m`

View the logs of the RayJob using the

`kubectl logs`

command. Make sure to replace`rayjob-pytorch-mnist-fc959`

with the name of the pod running your RayJob.`kubectl logs -n kuberay rayjob-pytorch-mnist-fc959`

In the output, you should see the training logs for the PyTorch model, similar to the following example output:

## View training results on the Ray Dashboard

When the RayJob successfully completes, you can view the training results on the Ray Dashboard. The Ray Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and visualizations of Ray clusters. You can use the Ray Dashboard to monitor the status of Ray clusters, view logs, and visualize the results of machine learning jobs.

To access the Ray Dashboard, you need to expose the Ray head service to the public internet by creating a *service shim* to expose the Ray head service on port 80 instead of port 8265.

Note

The `deploy.sh`

described in the previous section automatically exposes the Ray head service to the public internet. The following steps are included in the `deploy.sh`

script.

Get the name of the Ray head service and save it in a shell variable using the following command:

`rayclusterhead=$(kubectl get service -n $kuberay_namespace | grep 'rayjob-pytorch-mnist-raycluster' | grep 'ClusterIP' | awk '{print $1}')`

Create the service shim to expose the Ray head service on port 80 using the

`kubectl expose service`

command.`kubectl expose service $rayclusterhead \ -n $kuberay_namespace \ --port=80 \ --target-port=8265 \ --type=NodePort \ --name=ray-dash`

Create the ingress to expose the service shim using the ingress controller using the following command:

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: ray-dash namespace: kuberay annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / spec: ingressClassName: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com rules: - http: paths: - backend: service: name: ray-dash port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix EOF`

Get the public IP address of the ingress controller using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service -n app-routing-system`

In the output, you should see the public IP address of the load balancer attached to the ingress controller. Copy the public IP address and paste it into a web browser. You should see the Ray Dashboard.


## Clean up resources

To clean up the resources created in this guide, you can delete the Azure resource group that contains the AKS cluster.
