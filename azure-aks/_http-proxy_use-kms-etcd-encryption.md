# HTTP proxy support in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to configure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to use an HTTP proxy for outbound internet access.

AKS clusters deployed into managed or custom virtual networks have certain outbound dependencies that are necessary to function properly, which created problems in environments requiring internet access to be routed through HTTP proxies. Nodes had no way of bootstrapping the configuration, environment variables, and certificates necessary to access internet services.

The HTTP proxy feature adds HTTP proxy support to AKS clusters, exposing a straightforward interface that you can use to secure AKS-required network traffic in proxy-dependent environments. With this feature, both AKS nodes and pods are configured to use the HTTP proxy. The feature also enables installation of a trusted certificate authority onto the nodes as part of bootstrapping a cluster. More complex solutions might require creating a chain of trust to establish secure communications across the network.

## Limitations and considerations

The following scenarios are **not** supported:

- Different proxy configurations per node pool
- User/Password authentication
- Custom certificate authorities (CAs) for API server communication
- AKS clusters with Windows node pools
- Node pools using Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS)
- Using * as wildcard attached to a domain suffix for noProxy

`httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, and `trustedCa`

have no value by default. Pods are injected with the following environment variables:

`HTTP_PROXY`

`http_proxy`

`HTTPS_PROXY`

`https_proxy`

`NO_PROXY`

`no_proxy`


To disable the injection of the proxy environment variables, you need to annotate the Pod with `"kubernetes.azure.com/no-http-proxy-vars":"true"`

.

## Before you begin

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a configuration file with HTTP proxy values

Create a file and provide values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, and `noProxy`

. If your environment requires it, provide a value for `trustedCa`

.

The schema for the config file looks like this:

```
{
"httpProxy": "string",
"httpsProxy": "string",
"noProxy": [
"string"
],
"trustedCa": "string"
}
```


Review requirements for each parameter:

`httpProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be`http`

.`httpsProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If not specified, then`httpProxy`

is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.`noProxy`

: A list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.`trustedCa`

: A string containing the`base64 encoded`

alternative CA certificate content. Currently only the`PEM`

format is supported.

Important

For compatibility with Go-based components that are part of the Kubernetes system, the certificate **must** support `Subject Alternative Names(SANs)`

instead of the deprecated Common Name certs.

There are differences in applications on how to comply with the environment variable `http_proxy`

, `https_proxy`

, and `no_proxy`

. Curl and Python don't support CIDR in `no_proxy`

, but Ruby does.

Example input:

```
{
"httpProxy": "http://myproxy.server.com:8080",
"httpsProxy": "https://myproxy.server.com:8080",
"noProxy": [
"localhost",
"127.0.0.1"
],
"trustedCA": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUgvVENDQmVXZ0F3SUJB...S0tLS0="
}
```


## Create a cluster with an HTTP proxy configuration using the Azure CLI

You can configure an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy configuration during cluster creation.

Use the

command and pass in your configuration as a JSON file.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --name $clusterName \ --resource-group $resourceGroup \ --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config.json \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Your cluster should initialize with the HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.

Verify the HTTP proxy configuration is on the pods and nodes by checking that the environment variables contain the appropriate values for

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

using the`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables are set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


## Update an HTTP proxy configuration

You can update HTTP proxy configurations on existing clusters, including:

- Updating an existing cluster to enable HTTP proxy and adding a new HTTP proxy configuration.
- Updating an existing cluster to change an HTTP proxy configuration.

### HTTP proxy update considerations

The `--http-proxy-config`

parameter should be set to a new JSON file with updated values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, `noProxy`

, and `trustedCa`

if necessary. The update injects new environment variables into pods with the new `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, or `noProxy`

values. Pods must be rotated for the apps to pick it up, because the environment variable values are injected by a mutating admission webhook.

Note

If switching to a new proxy, the new proxy must already exist for the update to be successful. After the upgrade is completed, you can delete the old proxy.

### Update a cluster to update or enable HTTP proxy

Enable or update HTTP proxy configurations on an existing cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

For example, let's say you created a new file with the base64 encoded string of the new CA cert called

*aks-proxy-config-2.json*. You can update the proxy configuration on your cluster with the following command:`az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config-2.json`


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Verify the HTTP proxy configuration is on the pods and nodes by checking that the environment variables contain the appropriate values for

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

using the`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables are set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


## Disable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster (Preview)

### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Disable HTTP Proxy requires a minimum of 18.0.0b13**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register `DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Update cluster to disable HTTP proxy (preview)

Update your cluster to disable HTTP proxy using the

command with`az aks update`

`--disable-http-proxy`

flag.`az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --disable-http-proxy`


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Verify HTTP proxy is disabled by validating the HTTP proxy configuration isn't set on the pods and nodes using the

`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables aren't set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


### Re-enable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster

When you create a cluster, HTTP proxy is enabled by default. Once you disable HTTP proxy on a cluster, the proxy configuration is saved in the database but the proxy variables are removed from the pods and nodes.

To re-enable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster, use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--enable-http-proxy`

flag.```
az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --enable-http-proxy
```


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Important

If you had an HTTP proxy configuration on your cluster before disabling, the existing HTTP proxy configuration automatically applies when you re-enable HTTP proxy on that cluster. We recommend verifying the configuration to ensure it meets your current requirements before proceeding. If you want to change your HTTP proxy configuration after re-enabling HTTP proxy, follow the steps to [Update the HTTP proxy configuration on an existing cluster](#update-a-cluster-to-update-or-enable-http-proxy).

## Configure an HTTP proxy configuration using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

You can deploy an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy using an ARM template.

Review requirements for each parameter:

`httpProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be`http`

.`httpsProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If not specified, then`httpProxy`

is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.`noProxy`

: A list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.`trustedCa`

: A string containing the`base64 encoded`

alternative CA certificate content. Currently only the`PEM`

format is supported.

Important

For compatibility with Go-based components that are part of the Kubernetes system, the certificate

**must**support`Subject Alternative Names (SANs)`

instead of the deprecated Common Name certs.There are differences in applications on how to comply with the environment variable

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

. Curl and Python don't support CIDR in`no_proxy`

, but Ruby does.Create a template with HTTP proxy parameters. In your template, provide values for

`httpProxy`

,`httpsProxy`

, and`noProxy`

. If necessary, provide a value for`trustedCa`

. The same schema used for CLI deployment exists in the`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

definition under`"properties"`

, as shown in the following example:`"properties": { ..., "httpProxyConfig": { "enabled": "true", "httpProxy": "string", "httpsProxy": "string", "noProxy": [ "string" ], "trustedCa": "string" } }`

Deploy your ARM template with the HTTP Proxy configuration. Your cluster should initialize with your HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.


## Update an HTTP proxy configuration

You can update HTTP proxy configurations on existing clusters, including:

- Updating an existing cluster to enable HTTP proxy and adding a new HTTP proxy configuration.
- Updating an existing cluster to change an HTTP proxy configuration.

### HTTP proxy update considerations

The `--http-proxy-config`

parameter should be set to a new JSON file with updated values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, `noProxy`

values. Pods must be rotated for the apps to pick it up, because the environment variable values are injected by a mutating admission webhook.

Note

If switching to a new proxy, the new proxy must already exist for the update to be successful. After the upgrade is completed, you can delete the old proxy.

### Update an ARM template to configure HTTP proxy

In your template, provide new values for

`httpProxy`

,`httpsProxy`

, and`noProxy`

. If necessary, provide a value for`trustedCa`

.The same schema used for CLI deployment exists in the

`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

definition under`"properties"`

, as shown in the following example:`"properties": { ..., "httpProxyConfig": { "enabled": "true", "httpProxy": "string", "httpsProxy": "string", "noProxy": [ "string" ], "trustedCa": "string" } }`

Deploy your ARM template with the updated HTTP Proxy configuration.

If you want to re-enable HTTP proxy, follow the steps to [Update an HTTP proxy configuration using an ARM template](#update-an-arm-template-to-configure-http-proxy).

## Istio add-on HTTP proxy for External Services

If you're using the [Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS](istio-about), you must create a Service Entry to enable your applications in the mesh to access noncluster or external resources via the HTTP proxy.

For example:

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
name: proxy
spec:
hosts:
- my-company-proxy.com # ignored
addresses:
- $PROXY_IP/32
ports:
- number: $PROXY_PORT
name: tcp
protocol: TCP
location: MESH_EXTERNAL
```


Create a file and provide values for

`PROXY_IP`

and`PROXY_PORT`

.You can deploy the Service Entry using:

`kubectl apply -f service_proxy.yaml`


## Monitoring add-on configuration

HTTP proxy with the monitoring add-on supports the following configurations:

- Outbound proxy without authentication
- Outbound proxy with trusted cert for Log Analytics endpoint

The following configuration isn't supported:

- Custom Metrics and Recommended Alerts features when using a proxy with trusted certificates

# Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

This article describes the legacy KMS experience for AKS. For new clusters running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later, we recommend using the new [KMS data encryption](kms-data-encryption) experience, which offers platform-managed keys, customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation, and a simplified configuration experience.

For conceptual information about data encryption options, see [Data encryption at rest concepts for AKS](kms-data-encryption-concepts).

This article shows you how to turn on encryption at rest for a public or private key vault using Azure Key Vault and the Key Management Service (KMS) plugin on AKS. You can use the KMS plugin to:

- Use a key in a key vault for etcd encryption.
- Bring your own keys.
- Provide encryption at rest for secrets stored in etcd.
- Rotate the keys in a key vault.

For more information on using KMS, see [Using a KMS provider for data encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.39.0 or later. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Warning

Starting on September 15, 2024, Konnectivity is no longer supported for private key vaults for new subscriptions or subscriptions that didn't previously use this configuration. For subscriptions currently using this configuration or used it in the past 60 days, support continues until AKS version 1.30 reaches end of life for community support.

KMS supports Konnectivity or [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for public key vaults.

KMS supports [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for both private and public key vaults.

You can use `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`

to verify the results and show that a `konnectivity-agent`

pod is running. If a pod is running, the AKS cluster is using Konnectivity. When you use API Server VNet Integration, you can run the `az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

command to verify that the `enableVnetIntegration`

setting is set to `true`

.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate KMS etcd encryption with AKS:

- Deleting the key, the key vault, or the associated identity isn't supported.
- KMS etcd encryption doesn't work with system-assigned managed identity. The key vault access policy must be set before the feature is turned on. System-assigned managed identity isn't available until after the cluster is created. Consider the cycle dependency.
- Because the firewall blocks traffic from the KMS plugin to Key Vault, two scenarios aren't supported. First, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with the firewall option
*Allow public access from specific virtual networks and IP addresses*. Second, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with*Disable public access*unless[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)is enabled. - The maximum number of secrets supported by a cluster with KMS turned on is
*2,000*. However, it's important to note that[KMS v2](use-kms-v2)isn't limited by this restriction and can handle a higher number of secrets. - Bring your own (BYO) Azure key vault from another tenant isn't supported.
- With KMS turned on, you can't change the associated key vault mode (public versus private). To
[update a key vault mode](update-kms-key-vault), you must first turn off KMS, and then turn it on again. - If a cluster has KMS turned on and has a private key vault, it must use the
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)tunnel. Konnectivity isn't supported. - Using the Virtual Machine Scale Sets API to scale the nodes in the cluster down to zero deallocates the nodes. The cluster then goes down and becomes unrecoverable.
- After you turn off KMS, you can't delete or expire the keys. Such behaviors would cause the API server to stop working.
- For a private cluster with KMS enabled and virtual network integration that uses a private key vault, the network security group (NSG) must allow TCP port 443 from the API server to the private key vault's private endpoint IP address. This limitation needs to be considered when using other rules in the API subnet NSG or cluster subnet NSG.

## Create a key vault and key for a public key vault

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault. You can use a public key vault with or without Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Warning

Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable.

If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see [Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a key vault with Azure RBAC using the

command. This example command also exports the key vault resource ID to an environment variable.`az keyvault create`

`export KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --enable-rbac-authorization true --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself permissions to create a key using the

command. This example assigns the Key Vault Crypto Officer role to the signed-in user.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) --assignee-principal-type "User" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`

Get the key ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az keyvault key show`

`export KEY_ID=$(az keyvault key show --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT --query 'key.kid' -o tsv) echo $KEY_ID`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a public key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a public key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a public key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a public key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a public key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a public key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable a public key vault and KMS on an existing AKS cluster

Enable KMS on a public key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Rotate existing keys in a public key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the public key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

KMS uses two keys at the same time. After the first key rotation, you need to ensure both the old and new keys are valid (not expired) until the next key rotation. After the second key rotation, the oldest key can be safely removed/expired.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

## Create a key vault and key for a private key vault

If you turn on KMS for a private key vault, AKS automatically creates a private endpoint and a private link in the node resource group. The key vault has a private endpoint connection with the AKS cluster.

Warning

Keep the following information in mind when using a private key vault:

- KMS only supports
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)for private key vault. - Creating or updating keys in a private key vault that doesn't have a private endpoint isn't supported. To learn how to manage private key vaults, see
[Integrate a key vault by using Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/private-link-service). - Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable. If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see
[Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a private key vault using the

command with the`az keyvault create`

`--public-network-access Disabled`

parameter.`az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --public-network-access Disabled`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a private key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a private key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a private key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a private key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a private key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to create a private link

For private key vaults, the Key Vault Contributor role is required to create a private link between the private key vault and the cluster.

Assign the Key Vault Contributor role using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Contributor" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a private key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a private key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update an existing AKS cluster to turn on KMS etcd encryption for a private key vault

Enable KMS on a private key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


### Rotate existing keys in a private key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the private key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

After you rotate the key, the previous key (key1) is still cached and shouldn't be deleted. If you want to delete the previous key (key1) immediately, you need to rotate the key twice. Then key2 and key3 are cached, and key1 can be deleted without affecting the existing cluster.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys in a private key vault using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Disable KMS on an AKS cluster

Before you turn off KMS, verify that KMS is enabled on the cluster using the

command.`az aks list`

`az aks list --query "[].{Name:name, KmsEnabled:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.enabled, KeyId:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId}" -o table`

Once confirmed, you can disable KMS using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

parameter.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`
