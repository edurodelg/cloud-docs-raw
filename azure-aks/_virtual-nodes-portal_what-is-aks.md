# Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to use virtual nodes in the Azure portal

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. To provide this communication, a virtual network subnet is created and delegated permissions are assigned. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet) by default.

This article shows you how to create a virtual network and subnets, and then deploy an AKS cluster that uses advanced networking using the Azure portal.

Note

For an overview of virtual node region availability and limitations, see [Use virtual nodes in AKS](virtual-nodes).

## Before you begin

You need the ACI service provider registered on your subscription.

Check the status of the ACI provider registration using the

command.`az provider list`

`az provider list --query "[?contains(namespace,'Microsoft.ContainerInstance')]" -o table`

The following example output shows the

*Microsoft.ContainerInstance*provider is*Registered*:`Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy --------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- Microsoft.ContainerInstance Registered RegistrationRequired`

If the provider is

*NotRegistered*, register it using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerInstance`


## Create an AKS cluster

- Navigate to the Azure portal home page.
- Select
**Create a resource**>**Containers**. - On the
**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**resource, select**Create**. - On the
**Basics**page, configure the following options:*Project details*: Select an Azure subscription, then select or create an Azure resource group, such as*myResourceGroup*.*Cluster details*: Enter a**Kubernetes cluster name**, such as*myAKSCluster*. Select a region and Kubernetes version for the AKS cluster.

- Select
**Next: Node pools**and check **Enable virtual nodes*. - Select
**Review + create**. - After the validation completes, select
**Create**.

By default, this process creates a managed cluster identity, which is used for cluster communication and integration with other Azure services. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity). You can also use a service principal as your cluster identity.

This process configures the cluster for advanced networking and the virtual nodes to use their own Azure virtual network subnet. The subnet has delegated permissions to connect Azure resources between the AKS cluster. If you don't already have a delegated subnet, the Azure portal creates and configures an Azure virtual network and subnet with the virtual nodes.

## Connect to the cluster

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. The `kubectl`

client is pre-installed in the Azure Cloud Shell.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the cluster name`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*:`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the single VM node created and the virtual Linux node named

*virtual-node-aci-linux*:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION virtual-node-aci-linux Ready agent 28m v1.11.2 aks-agentpool-14693408-0 Ready agent 32m v1.11.2`


## Deploy a sample app

In the Azure Cloud Shell, create a file named

`virtual-node.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: aci-helloworld spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: aci-helloworld template: metadata: labels: app: aci-helloworld spec: containers: - name: aci-helloworld image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld ports: - containerPort: 80 nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/role: agent beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux type: virtual-kubelet tolerations: - key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider operator: Exists`

The YAML defines a

[nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)and[toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/), which allows the pod to be scheduled on the virtual node. The pod is assigned an internal IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet delegated for use with virtual nodes.Run the application using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f virtual-node.yaml`

View the pods scheduled on the node using the

command with the`kubectl get pods`

`-o wide`

argument.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the

`virtual-node-helloworld`

pod scheduled on the`virtual-node-linux`

node.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE virtual-node-helloworld-9b55975f-bnmfl 1/1 Running 0 4m 10.241.0.4 virtual-node-aci-linux`


Note

If you use images stored in Azure Container Registry, [configure and use a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). A limitation of virtual nodes is you can't use integrated Microsoft Entra service principal authentication. If you don't use a secret, pods scheduled on virtual nodes fail to start and report the error `HTTP response status code 400 error code "InaccessibleImage"`

.

## Test the virtual node pod

To test the pod running on the virtual node, browse to the demo application with a web client. The pod is assigned an internal IP address, so you can easily test the connectivity from another pod on the AKS cluster.

Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it using the following

`kubectl run`

command.`kubectl run -it --rm virtual-node-test --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

Install

`curl`

in the pod using the following`apt-get`

command.`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

Access the address of your pod using the following

`curl`

command and provide your internal IP address.`curl -L http://10.241.0.4`

The following condensed example output shows the demo application.

`<html> <head> <title>Welcome to Azure Container Instances!</title> </head> [...]`

Close the terminal session to your test pod with

`exit`

, which also deletes the pod.`exit`


## Next steps

In this article, you scheduled a pod on the virtual node and assigned a private, internal IP address. If you want, you can instead create a service deployment and route traffic to your pod through a load balancer or ingress controller. For more information, see [Create a basic ingress controller in AKS](ingress-basic).

Virtual nodes are one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:

# What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

This article is intended for platform administrators or developers who are looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

Note

AKS is [CNCF-certified](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) and is compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure compliance overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/compliance/).

## Container solutions in Azure

Azure offers a range of container solutions designed to accommodate various workloads, architectures, and business needs.
