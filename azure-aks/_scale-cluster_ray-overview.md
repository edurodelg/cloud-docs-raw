# Manually scale the node count in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

If the resource needs of your applications change, your cluster performance may be impacted due to low capacity on CPU, memory, PID space, or disk sizes. To address these changes, you can manually scale your AKS cluster to run a different number of nodes. When you scale in, nodes are carefully [cordoned and drained](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/) to minimize disruption to running applications. When you scale out, AKS waits until nodes are marked **Ready** by the Kubernetes cluster before pods are scheduled on them.

This article describes how to manually increase or decrease the number of nodes in an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

Review the

[AKS service quotas and limits](quotas-skus-regions#service-quotas-and-limits)to verify your cluster can scale to your desired number of nodes.The name of a node pool may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-11 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.


## Scale the cluster nodes

Important

Removing nodes from a node pool using the kubectl command isn't supported. Doing so can create scaling issues with your AKS cluster.

Get the

*name*of your node pool using thecommand. The following example gets the node pool name for the cluster named`az aks show`

*myAKSCluster*in the*myResourceGroup*resource group:`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query agentPoolProfiles`

The following example output shows that the

*name*is*nodepool1*:`[ { "count": 1, "maxPods": 110, "name": "nodepool1", "osDiskSizeGb": 30, "osType": "Linux", "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2" } ]`

Scale the cluster nodes using the

command. The following example scales a cluster named`az aks scale`

*myAKSCluster*to a single node. Provide your own`--nodepool-name`

from the previous command, such as*nodepool1*:`az aks scale --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --nodepool-name <your node pool name>`

The following example output shows the cluster successfully scaled to one node, as shown in the

*agentPoolProfiles*section:`{ "aadProfile": null, "addonProfiles": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": 1, "maxPods": 110, "name": "nodepool1", "osDiskSizeGb": 30, "osType": "Linux", "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", "vnetSubnetId": null } ], [...] }`


## Scale `User`

node pools to 0

Unlike `System`

node pools that always require running nodes, `User`

node pools allow you to scale to 0. To learn more on the differences between system and user node pools, see [System and user node pools](use-system-pools).

Important

You can't scale a user node pool with the cluster autoscaler enabled to 0 nodes. To scale a user node pool to 0 nodes, you must disable the cluster autoscaler first. For more information, see [Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool](cluster-autoscaler#disable-the-cluster-autoscaler-on-a-node-pool).

To scale a user pool to 0, you can use the

[az aks nodepool scale](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-scale)in alternative to the above`az aks scale`

command, and set`0`

as your node count.`az aks nodepool scale --name <your node pool name> --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-count 0`

You can also autoscale

`User`

node pools to zero nodes, by setting the`--min-count`

parameter of the[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to`0`

.

## Next steps

In this article, you manually scaled an AKS cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes. You can also use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler) to automatically scale your cluster.

# Deploy a Ray cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy a Ray cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the KubeRay operator. You also learn how to use the Ray cluster to train a simple machine learning model and display the results on the Ray Dashboard.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## What is Ray?

[Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html#) is an open-source project developed at UC Berkeley's RISE Lab that provides a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. It consists of a core distributed runtime and a set of AI libraries designed to accelerate machine learning workloads.

Ray simplifies the process of running compute-intensive Python tasks at scale, allowing you to seamlessly scale your applications. The framework supports various machine learning tasks, including distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and production model serving.

For more information, see the [Ray GitHub repository](https://github.com/ray-project/ray).

## What is KubeRay?

[KubeRay](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started.html) is an open-source Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing Ray clusters on Kubernetes. KubeRay automates the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of Ray clusters. It provides a declarative way to define Ray clusters using Kubernetes custom resources, making it easy to manage Ray clusters alongside other Kubernetes resources.

For more information, see the [KubeRay GitHub repository](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay).

## Ray deployment process

The deployment process consists of the following steps:

- Use Terraform to create a local plan file to define the desired state for infrastructure required AKS infrastructure that consists of an Azure resource group, a dedicated system node pool, and a workload node pool for Ray with three nodes.
- Deploy a local Terraform plan to Azure.
- Retrieve outputs from the Terraform deployment and obtain Kubernetes credentials to the newly deployed AKS cluster.
- Install the Helm Ray repository and deploy KubeRay to the AKS cluster using Helm.
- Download and execute a
[Ray Job](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/index.html)YAML manifest from the Ray GitHub samples repo to perform an image classification with a[MNIST](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist)dataset using[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/machinelearning/what-is-convolutional-neural-network-%E2%80%94-cnn-deep-learning/4184725). - Output the logs from the Ray Job to gain insight into the machine learning process performed by Ray.
