# Node Problem Detector (NPD) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Node Problem Detector (NPD)](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) is an open source Kubernetes component that detects node-related problems and reports on them. It runs as a systemd serviced on each node in the cluster and collects various metrics and system information, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network connectivity. When it detects a problem, it generates *events and/or node conditions*. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses NPD to monitor and manage nodes in a Kubernetes cluster running on the Azure cloud platform. The AKS Linux extension enables NPD by default.

Note

Upgrades to NPD are independent of the node image and Kubernetes version upgrade processes. If a node pool is unhealthy (that is, in a failed state), new NPD versions aren't installed.

## Node conditions

Node conditions indicate a permanent problem that makes the node unavailable. AKS uses the following node conditions from NPD to expose permanent problems on the node. NPD also emits corresponding Kubernetes events.

| Problem Daemon type | NodeCondition | Reason | Compute type |
|---|---|---|---|
| CustomPluginMonitor | FilesystemCorruptionProblem | FilesystemCorruptionDetected | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | KubeletProblem | KubeletIsDown | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | ContainerRuntimeProblem | ContainerRuntimeIsDown | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | VMEventScheduled | VMEventScheduled | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentUnregisterNetDevice | UnregisterNetDevice | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentKubeletRestart | FrequentKubeletRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentContainerdRestart | FrequentContainerdRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentDockerRestart | FrequentDockerRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | GPUMissing | Observed GPU count does not match expected GPU count | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | NVLinkStatusInactive | NVLinkStatusInactive | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | XIDErrors | XID errors present in kernel log | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | IBLinkFlapping | Intermittent InfiniBand device connectivity | GPU only |
| SystemLogMonitor | KernelDeadlock | DockerHung | General purpose |
| SystemLogMonitor | ReadonlyFilesystem | FilesystemIsReadOnly | General purpose |

Note

The `GPU only`

node conditions currently apply to AKS node pools with `Standard_ND96asr_v4`

or `Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5`

VM size, and are supported on standard GPU and [MIG-enabled GPU node pools](gpu-multi-instance).

## Events

NPD emits events with relevant information to help you diagnose underlying issues.

| Problem Daemon type | Reason | Frequency | Description | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CustomPluginMonitor | EgressBlocked | 30 min | This event checks for connectivity to external
|

[https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents](https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents)for more information[https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents](https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents)for more information[https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents](https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents)for more information[https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents](https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents)for more information[https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents](https://aka.ms/aks/scheduledevents)for more informationIn certain instances, AKS automatically cordons and drains the node to minimize disruption to workloads. For more information about the events and actions, see [Node autodrain](/en-us/azure/aks/node-auto-repair#node-auto-drain).

### EgressBlocked

The list of endpoints checked by the EgressBlocked are listed below

Note

The actual endpoints will depend on the type of the cluster and the location where it's hosted (Public cloud vs Airgapped clouds). Review the documentation for outbound access [here](/en-us/azure/aks/outbound-rules-control-egress). The documentation is for public clouds

| Type | Example | Note |
|---|---|---|
| MCR |
|

## Check the node conditions and events

Check the node conditions and events using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node my-aks-node`

Your output should look similar to the following example condensed output:

`... ...

These events are also available in [Container Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) through [KubeEvents](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/kubeevents).

## Metrics

NPD also exposes Prometheus metrics based on the node problems, which you can use for monitoring and alerting. These metrics are exposed on port 20257 of the Node IP and Prometheus can scrape them.

The following example YAML shows a scrape config you can use with the [Azure Managed Prometheus add on as a DaemonSet](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration#advanced-setup-configure-custom-prometheus-scrape-jobs-for-the-daemonset):

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: ama-metrics-prometheus-config-node
namespace: kube-system
data:
prometheus-config: |-
global:
scrape_interval: 1m
scrape_configs:
- job_name: node-problem-detector
scrape_interval: 1m
scheme: http
metrics_path: /metrics
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__metrics_path__]
regex: (.*)
target_label: metrics_path
- source_labels: [__address__]
replacement: '$NODE_NAME'
target_label: instance
static_configs:
- targets: ['$NODE_IP:20257']
```


The following example shows the scraped metrics:

```
problem_gauge{reason="UnregisterNetDevice",type="FrequentUnregisterNetDevice"} 0
problem_gauge{reason="VMEventScheduled",type="VMEventScheduled"} 0
```

# Enable Istio CNI for Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to enable Istio CNI for the Istio-based service mesh add-on on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Istio CNI improves security by eliminating the need for privileged network capabilities in application workloads within the service mesh.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Overview

By default, Istio service mesh uses privileged init containers (`istio-init`

) in each application pod to configure network traffic redirection to the Envoy sidecar proxy. These init containers require `NET_ADMIN`

and `NET_RAW`

capabilities, which are often flagged as security concerns in enterprise environments.

Istio CNI addresses this security concern by moving the network configuration responsibilities from individual pod init containers to a cluster-level CNI plugin. This approach:

**Improves security**: Removes the need for privileged network capabilities (`NET_ADMIN`

,`NET_RAW`

) from application workloads**Simplifies pod security policies**: Application pods only require minimal capabilities**Maintains functionality**: Provides the same traffic management capabilities as the traditional init container approach

When Istio CNI is enabled, application pods use a minimal `istio-validation`

init container that drops all capabilities instead of the privileged `istio-init`

container.

Note

Istio CNI is **not** a replacement for [Azure CNI](concepts-network-cni-overview) and will not interfere with your normal AKS networking. It is a separate plugin designed to handle Istio’s traffic redirection setup at the node level, improving security by removing the need for privileged init containers in application pods.

## Before you begin

Install the Azure CLI version 2.77.0 or later. You can run

`az --version`

to verify the version. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension version 19.0.0b5 or later:`az extension add --name aks-preview`

If you already have the

`aks-preview`

extension, update it to the latest version:`az extension update --name aks-preview`

Register the

`IstioCNIPreview`

feature flag on your Azure subscription:`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "IstioCNIPreview"`

Use the following command to check the registration status:

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "IstioCNIPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the feature to register. Verify the registration state shows

`Registered`

:`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Features/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/features/IstioCNIPreview", "name": "Microsoft.ContainerService/IstioCNIPreview", "properties": { "state": "Registered" }, "type": "Microsoft.Features/providers/features" }`

You need an AKS cluster with the Istio-based service mesh add-on enabled. If you don't have this setup, see

[Deploy Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service](istio-deploy-addon).Ensure your Istio service mesh is using revision

`asm-1-25`

or later. You can check the current revision with:`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --query 'serviceMeshProfile.istio.revisions'`


Note

Istio CNI is not compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 node pools. Ensure your cluster uses Ubuntu 22.04 or Azure Linux node pools.

### Set environment variables

```
export CLUSTER=<cluster-name>
export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name>
```


## Enable Istio CNI

Use the following command to enable Istio CNI on your AKS cluster:

```
az aks mesh enable-istio-cni --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


## Verify Istio CNI is enabled

Use `az aks get-credentials`

to get the credentials for your AKS cluster:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


After enabling Istio CNI, verify the installation by checking that the CNI DaemonSet is running:

```
kubectl get daemonset -n aks-istio-system
```


You should see the Istio CNI DaemonSet running:

```
NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE NODE SELECTOR AGE
azure-service-mesh-istio-cni-addon-node 3 3 3 3 3 kubernetes.io/os=linux 94s
```


## Deploy workloads and verify behavior

To verify the security improvement, you can deploy the bookinfo sample application and check that workloads use the secure `istio-validation`

init container instead of the privileged `istio-init`

container.

### Deploy sample application

First, enable sidecar injection for the default namespace:

```
# Get the current Istio revision
REVISION=$(az aks show --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER} --query 'serviceMeshProfile.istio.revisions[0]' -o tsv)
# Label the namespace for sidecar injection
kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=${REVISION}
```


Deploy the bookinfo sample application:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.25/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```


### Verify secure init container usage

Check that the deployed pods use the secure `istio-validation`

init container instead of `istio-init`

:

```
kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.initContainers[0].name}{"\t"}{.spec.initContainers[0].securityContext.capabilities}{"\n"}{end}'
```


Expected output should show `istio-validation`

as the init container with dropped capabilities:

```
details-v1-799dc5d847-7x9gl istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
productpage-v1-99d6d698f-89gpj istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
ratings-v1-7545c4bb6c-m7t42 istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
reviews-v1-8679d76d6c-jz4vg istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
reviews-v2-5b9c77895c-b2b7m istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
reviews-v3-5b57874f5f-kk9rt istio-validation {"drop":["ALL"]}
```


You can also describe a specific pod to verify the security context:

```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -A 10 -B 5 "istio-validation"
```


The output should show that the `istio-validation`

init container has no privileged capabilities:

```
Init Containers:
istio-validation:
Container ID: containerd://...
Image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:...
...
Security Context:
capabilities:
drop:
- ALL
runAsGroup: 1337
runAsNonRoot: true
runAsUser: 1337
```


## Disable Istio CNI

To disable Istio CNI and return to using traditional init containers, use the following command:

```
az aks mesh disable-istio-cni --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


After disabling Istio CNI:

The CNI DaemonSet will be removed:

`kubectl get daemonset azure-service-mesh-istio-cni-addon-node -n aks-istio-system`

Expected output (no CNI DaemonSet):

`Error from server (NotFound): daemonsets.apps "azure-service-mesh-istio-cni-addon-node" not found`

New workloads will use the traditional

`istio-init`

init container with network capabilities. Restart all existing deployments to pick up the change:`kubectl rollout restart deployment/details-v1 kubectl rollout restart deployment/productpage-v1 kubectl rollout restart deployment/ratings-v1 kubectl rollout restart deployment/reviews-v1 kubectl rollout restart deployment/reviews-v2 kubectl rollout restart deployment/reviews-v3`

Verify init container name and capabilities:

`kubectl get pods -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.spec.initContainers[0].name}{"\t"}{.spec.initContainers[0].securityContext.capabilities}{"\n"}{end}'`

Expected output should show

`istio-init`

with network capabilities:`details-v1-57bc58c559-722v8 istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]} productpage-v1-7bb64f657c-jw6gs istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]} ratings-v1-57d5594c75-4zd49 istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]} reviews-v1-7fd8f9cd59-mdcf9 istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]} reviews-v2-7b8bdc9cdf-k9qgb istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]} reviews-v3-588854d9d7-s2f7j istio-init {"drop":["ALL"]}`

# Use GPUs for compute-intensive workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Graphical processing units (GPUs) are often used for compute-intensive workloads, such as graphics and visualization workloads. AKS supports GPU-enabled Linux node pools to run compute-intensive Kubernetes workloads.

This article helps you provision nodes with schedulable GPUs on new and existing AKS clusters.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported GPU-enabled VMs

To view the available GPU-enabled VMs, see [GPU-optimized VM sizes in Azure](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu). If a GPU VM size is not in our list of supported VM sizes, AKS does not install the necessary GPU software components or provide support. AKS allows the use of unsupported GPU VM sizes after [skipping the automatic GPU driver installation](#skip-gpu-driver-installation).

Check available and supported VM sizes using the [ az vm list-skus](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command.

```
az vm list-skus --location <your-location> --output table
```


For AKS node pools, we recommend a minimum size of *Standard_NC6s_v3*. The NVv4 series (based on AMD GPUs) aren't supported on AKS.

Note

GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) tool and [region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

## Limitations

- If you're using an Azure Linux GPU-enabled node pool, automatic security patches aren't applied. Refer to your current AKS API version for the default behavior of node OS upgrade channel.
[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks)isn't supported with NVIDIA GPU on AKS.[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard)isn't supported with NVIDIA GPU on AKS.

Note

For AKS API version 2023-06-01 or later, the default channel for node OS upgrade is *NodeImage*. For previous versions, the default channel is *None*. To learn more, see [auto-upgrade](auto-upgrade-node-image).

- Updating an existing node pool to add GPU VM size is not supported on AKS.

Note

The AKS GPU image (preview) is retired starting on January 10, 2025. The custom header is no longer available, meaning that you can't create new GPU-enabled node pools using the AKS GPU image. We recommend migrating to or using the default GPU configuration rather than the GPU image, as the GPU image is no longer supported. For more information, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases), or view this retirement announcement in our [AKS public roadmap](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4472).

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.72.2 or later installed to set the
`--gpu-driver`

field. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you have the
`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension installed, please update the version to 18.0.0b2 or later.

## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command. The following example command gets the credentials for the

*myAKSCluster*in the

*myResourceGroup*resource group:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```


## Options for using NVIDIA GPUs

Using NVIDIA GPUs involves the installation of various NVIDIA software components such as the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file), GPU driver installation, and more.

Note

By default, Microsoft automatically maintains the version of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment, and AKS * supports and manages* it. While the NVIDIA drivers are installed by default on GPU capable nodes, you need to install the device plugin.

### NVIDIA device plugin installation

NVIDIA device plugin installation is required when using GPUs on AKS. In some cases, the installation is handled automatically, such as when using the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html). Alternatively, you can manually install the NVIDIA device plugin.

#### Manually install the NVIDIA device plugin

You can deploy a DaemonSet for the NVIDIA device plugin, which runs a pod on each node to provide the required drivers for the GPUs. This is the recommended approach when using GPU-enabled node pools for Azure Linux.

To use the default OS SKU, you create the node pool without specifying an OS SKU. The node pool is configured for the default operating system based on the Kubernetes version of the cluster.

Add a node pool to your cluster using the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name gpunp \
--node-count 1 \
--node-vm-size Standard_NC6s_v3 \
--node-taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \
--enable-cluster-autoscaler \
--min-count 1 \
--max-count 3
```


This command adds a node pool named *gpunp* to *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup* and uses parameters to configure the following node pool settings:

`--node-vm-size`

: Sets the VM size for the node in the node pool to*Standard_NC6s_v3*.`--node-taints`

: Specifies a*sku=gpu:NoSchedule*taint on the node pool.`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

: Enables the cluster autoscaler.`--min-count`

: Configures the cluster autoscaler to maintain a minimum of one node in the node pool.`--max-count`

: Configures the cluster autoscaler to maintain a maximum of three nodes in the node pool.

Note

Taints and VM sizes can only be set for node pools during node pool creation, but you can update autoscaler settings at any time.

Create a namespace using the

command.`kubectl create namespace`

`kubectl create namespace gpu-resources`

Create a file named

*nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml*and paste the following YAML manifest provided as part of the[NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes project](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/blob/4b3d6b0a6613a3672f71ea4719fd8633eaafb4f3/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml):`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: name: nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset namespace: gpu-resources spec: selector: matchLabels: name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds updateStrategy: type: RollingUpdate template: metadata: labels: name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds spec: tolerations: - key: "sku" operator: "Equal" value: "gpu" effect: "NoSchedule" # Mark this pod as a critical add-on; when enabled, the critical add-on # scheduler reserves resources for critical add-on pods so that they can # be rescheduled after a failure. # See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/ priorityClassName: "system-node-critical" containers: - image: nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:v0.18.0 name: nvidia-device-plugin-ctr env: - name: FAIL_ON_INIT_ERROR value: "false" securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false capabilities: drop: ["ALL"] volumeMounts: - name: device-plugin mountPath: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins volumes: - name: device-plugin hostPath: path: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins`

Create the DaemonSet and confirm the NVIDIA device plugin is created successfully using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml`

Now that you successfully installed the NVIDIA device plugin, you can check that your

[GPUs are schedulable](#confirm-that-gpus-are-schedulable)and[run a GPU workload](#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload).

### Skip GPU driver installation

If you want to control the installation of the NVIDIA drivers or use the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html), you can skip the default GPU driver installation. Microsoft **doesn't support or manage** the maintenance and compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment.

Note

The `gpu-driver`

API field is a suggested alternative for customers previously using the `--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag.

- The
`--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag on AKS will be retired on 14 August 2025. When spinning up a new node pool, the existing behavior of skipping automatic GPU driver installation can be replicated by setting the`--gpu-driver`

field to`none`

. - After 14 August 2025, you will not be able to provision AKS GPU-enabled node pools with the
`--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag to bypass this default behavior. For more information, see.`skip-gpu-driver`

tag retirement

Create a node pool using the

command and set`az aks nodepool add`

`--gpu-driver`

field to`none`

to skip default GPU driver installation.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \ --node-count 1 \ --gpu-driver none \ --node-vm-size Standard_NC6s_v3 \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3`

Setting the

`--gpu-driver`

API field to`none`

during node pool creation skips the automatic GPU driver installation. Any existing nodes aren't changed. You can scale the node pool to zero and then back up to make the change take effect.If you get the error

`unrecognized arguments: --gpu-driver none`

then[update the Azure CLI version](/en-us/cli/azure/update-azure-cli). For more information, see[Before you begin](#before-you-begin).You can optionally install the NVIDIA GPU Operator following

[these steps](nvidia-gpu-operator).

## Confirm that GPUs are schedulable

After creating your cluster, confirm that GPUs are schedulable in Kubernetes.

List the nodes in your cluster using the

command.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-gpunp-28993262-0 Ready agent 13m v1.20.7`

Confirm the GPUs are schedulable using the

command.`kubectl describe node`

`kubectl describe node aks-gpunp-28993262-0`

Under the

*Capacity*section, the GPU should list as`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`

. Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:`Name: aks-gpunp-28993262-0 Roles: agent Labels: accelerator=nvidia [...] Capacity: [...] nvidia.com/gpu: 1 [...]`


## Run a GPU-enabled workload

To see the GPU in action, you can schedule a GPU-enabled workload with the appropriate resource request. In this example, we'll run a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) job against the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Create a file named

*samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml*and paste the following YAML manifest, which includes a resource limit of`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`

:Note

If you receive a version mismatch error when calling into drivers, such as "CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version", review the

[NVIDIA driver matrix compatibility chart](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).`apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: labels: app: samples-tf-mnist-demo name: samples-tf-mnist-demo spec: template: metadata: labels: app: samples-tf-mnist-demo spec: containers: - name: samples-tf-mnist-demo image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu args: ["--max_steps", "500"] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 restartPolicy: OnFailure tolerations: - key: "sku" operator: "Equal" value: "gpu" effect: "NoSchedule"`

Run the job using the

command, which parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml`


## View the status of the GPU-enabled workload

Monitor the progress of the job using the

command with the`kubectl get jobs`

`--watch`

flag. It may take a few minutes to first pull the image and process the dataset.`kubectl get jobs samples-tf-mnist-demo --watch`

When the

*COMPLETIONS*column shows*1/1*, the job has successfully finished, as shown in the following example output:`NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE samples-tf-mnist-demo 0/1 3m29s 3m29s samples-tf-mnist-demo 1/1 3m10s 3m36s`

Exit the

`kubectl --watch`

process with*Ctrl-C*.Get the name of the pod using the

command.`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get pods --selector app=samples-tf-mnist-demo`

View the output of the GPU-enabled workload using the

command.`kubectl logs`

`kubectl logs samples-tf-mnist-demo-smnr6`

The following condensed example output of the pod logs confirms that the appropriate GPU device,

`Tesla K80`

, has been discovered:`2019-05-16 16:08:31.258328: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:137] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA 2019-05-16 16:08:31.396846: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1030] Found device 0 with properties: name: Tesla K80 major: 3 minor: 7 memoryClockRate(GHz): 0.8235 pciBusID: 2fd7:00:00.0 totalMemory: 11.17GiB freeMemory: 11.10GiB 2019-05-16 16:08:31.396886: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1120] Creating TensorFlow device (/device:GPU:0) -> (device: 0, name: Tesla K80, pci bus id: 2fd7:00:00.0, compute capability: 3.7) 2019-05-16 16:08:36.076962: I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:139] successfully opened CUDA library libcupti.so.8.0 locally Successfully downloaded train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz 9912422 bytes.

## Upgrading a node pool

Whether you want to [update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) or [upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) your node pools, you might notice that there is no `--gpu-driver`

parameter for either operation. You might run into an error like `unrecognized arguments: --gpu-driver none`

if you attempt to pass the parameter. There is no need to call on the parameter, as the value is not affected by any such operations.

When you first create your node pool, whatever parameter you declare for `--gpu-driver`

will not be impacted by upgrade/update operations. If you don't want any drivers to be installed, and selected `--gpu-driver None`

when creating your node pool, drivers will not be installed in any subsequent updates/upgrades.

## Clean up resources

Remove the associated Kubernetes objects you created in this article using the [ kubectl delete job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#delete) command.

```
kubectl delete jobs samples-tf-mnist-demo
```

# Use GPUs for compute-intensive workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Graphical processing units (GPUs) are often used for compute-intensive workloads, such as graphics and visualization workloads. AKS supports GPU-enabled Linux node pools to run compute-intensive Kubernetes workloads.

This article helps you provision nodes with schedulable GPUs on new and existing AKS clusters.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported GPU-enabled VMs

To view the available GPU-enabled VMs, see [GPU-optimized VM sizes in Azure](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu). If a GPU VM size is not in our list of supported VM sizes, AKS does not install the necessary GPU software components or provide support. AKS allows the use of unsupported GPU VM sizes after [skipping the automatic GPU driver installation](#skip-gpu-driver-installation).

Check available and supported VM sizes using the [ az vm list-skus](/en-us/cli/azure/vm) command.

```
az vm list-skus --location <your-location> --output table
```


For AKS node pools, we recommend a minimum size of *Standard_NC6s_v3*. The NVv4 series (based on AMD GPUs) aren't supported on AKS.

Note

GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) tool and [region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

## Limitations

- If you're using an Azure Linux GPU-enabled node pool, automatic security patches aren't applied. Refer to your current AKS API version for the default behavior of node OS upgrade channel.
[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks)isn't supported with NVIDIA GPU on AKS.[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard)isn't supported with NVIDIA GPU on AKS.

Note

For AKS API version 2023-06-01 or later, the default channel for node OS upgrade is *NodeImage*. For previous versions, the default channel is *None*. To learn more, see [auto-upgrade](auto-upgrade-node-image).

- Updating an existing node pool to add GPU VM size is not supported on AKS.

Note

The AKS GPU image (preview) is retired starting on January 10, 2025. The custom header is no longer available, meaning that you can't create new GPU-enabled node pools using the AKS GPU image. We recommend migrating to or using the default GPU configuration rather than the GPU image, as the GPU image is no longer supported. For more information, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases), or view this retirement announcement in our [AKS public roadmap](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4472).

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.72.2 or later installed to set the
`--gpu-driver`

field. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you have the
`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension installed, please update the version to 18.0.0b2 or later.

## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command. The following example command gets the credentials for the

*myAKSCluster*in the

*myResourceGroup*resource group:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```


## Options for using NVIDIA GPUs

Using NVIDIA GPUs involves the installation of various NVIDIA software components such as the [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file), GPU driver installation, and more.

Note

By default, Microsoft automatically maintains the version of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment, and AKS * supports and manages* it. While the NVIDIA drivers are installed by default on GPU capable nodes, you need to install the device plugin.

### NVIDIA device plugin installation

NVIDIA device plugin installation is required when using GPUs on AKS. In some cases, the installation is handled automatically, such as when using the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html). Alternatively, you can manually install the NVIDIA device plugin.

#### Manually install the NVIDIA device plugin

You can deploy a DaemonSet for the NVIDIA device plugin, which runs a pod on each node to provide the required drivers for the GPUs. This is the recommended approach when using GPU-enabled node pools for Azure Linux.

To use the default OS SKU, you create the node pool without specifying an OS SKU. The node pool is configured for the default operating system based on the Kubernetes version of the cluster.

Add a node pool to your cluster using the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name gpunp \
--node-count 1 \
--node-vm-size Standard_NC6s_v3 \
--node-taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \
--enable-cluster-autoscaler \
--min-count 1 \
--max-count 3
```


This command adds a node pool named *gpunp* to *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup* and uses parameters to configure the following node pool settings:

`--node-vm-size`

: Sets the VM size for the node in the node pool to*Standard_NC6s_v3*.`--node-taints`

: Specifies a*sku=gpu:NoSchedule*taint on the node pool.`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

: Enables the cluster autoscaler.`--min-count`

: Configures the cluster autoscaler to maintain a minimum of one node in the node pool.`--max-count`

: Configures the cluster autoscaler to maintain a maximum of three nodes in the node pool.

Note

Taints and VM sizes can only be set for node pools during node pool creation, but you can update autoscaler settings at any time.

Create a namespace using the

command.`kubectl create namespace`

`kubectl create namespace gpu-resources`

Create a file named

*nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml*and paste the following YAML manifest provided as part of the[NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes project](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/blob/4b3d6b0a6613a3672f71ea4719fd8633eaafb4f3/deployments/static/nvidia-device-plugin.yml):`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: name: nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset namespace: gpu-resources spec: selector: matchLabels: name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds updateStrategy: type: RollingUpdate template: metadata: labels: name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds spec: tolerations: - key: "sku" operator: "Equal" value: "gpu" effect: "NoSchedule" # Mark this pod as a critical add-on; when enabled, the critical add-on # scheduler reserves resources for critical add-on pods so that they can # be rescheduled after a failure. # See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/ priorityClassName: "system-node-critical" containers: - image: nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:v0.18.0 name: nvidia-device-plugin-ctr env: - name: FAIL_ON_INIT_ERROR value: "false" securityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false capabilities: drop: ["ALL"] volumeMounts: - name: device-plugin mountPath: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins volumes: - name: device-plugin hostPath: path: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins`

Create the DaemonSet and confirm the NVIDIA device plugin is created successfully using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml`

Now that you successfully installed the NVIDIA device plugin, you can check that your

[GPUs are schedulable](#confirm-that-gpus-are-schedulable)and[run a GPU workload](#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload).

### Skip GPU driver installation

If you want to control the installation of the NVIDIA drivers or use the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html), you can skip the default GPU driver installation. Microsoft **doesn't support or manage** the maintenance and compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment.

Note

The `gpu-driver`

API field is a suggested alternative for customers previously using the `--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag.

- The
`--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag on AKS will be retired on 14 August 2025. When spinning up a new node pool, the existing behavior of skipping automatic GPU driver installation can be replicated by setting the`--gpu-driver`

field to`none`

. - After 14 August 2025, you will not be able to provision AKS GPU-enabled node pools with the
`--skip-gpu-driver-install`

node pool tag to bypass this default behavior. For more information, see.`skip-gpu-driver`

tag retirement

Create a node pool using the

command and set`az aks nodepool add`

`--gpu-driver`

field to`none`

to skip default GPU driver installation.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \ --node-count 1 \ --gpu-driver none \ --node-vm-size Standard_NC6s_v3 \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3`

Setting the

`--gpu-driver`

API field to`none`

during node pool creation skips the automatic GPU driver installation. Any existing nodes aren't changed. You can scale the node pool to zero and then back up to make the change take effect.If you get the error

`unrecognized arguments: --gpu-driver none`

then[update the Azure CLI version](/en-us/cli/azure/update-azure-cli). For more information, see[Before you begin](#before-you-begin).You can optionally install the NVIDIA GPU Operator following

[these steps](nvidia-gpu-operator).

## Confirm that GPUs are schedulable

After creating your cluster, confirm that GPUs are schedulable in Kubernetes.

List the nodes in your cluster using the

command.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-gpunp-28993262-0 Ready agent 13m v1.20.7`

Confirm the GPUs are schedulable using the

command.`kubectl describe node`

`kubectl describe node aks-gpunp-28993262-0`

Under the

*Capacity*section, the GPU should list as`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`

. Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:`Name: aks-gpunp-28993262-0 Roles: agent Labels: accelerator=nvidia [...] Capacity: [...] nvidia.com/gpu: 1 [...]`


## Run a GPU-enabled workload

To see the GPU in action, you can schedule a GPU-enabled workload with the appropriate resource request. In this example, we'll run a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) job against the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Create a file named

*samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml*and paste the following YAML manifest, which includes a resource limit of`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`

:Note

If you receive a version mismatch error when calling into drivers, such as "CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version", review the

[NVIDIA driver matrix compatibility chart](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).`apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: labels: app: samples-tf-mnist-demo name: samples-tf-mnist-demo spec: template: metadata: labels: app: samples-tf-mnist-demo spec: containers: - name: samples-tf-mnist-demo image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu args: ["--max_steps", "500"] imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 restartPolicy: OnFailure tolerations: - key: "sku" operator: "Equal" value: "gpu" effect: "NoSchedule"`

Run the job using the

command, which parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml`


## View the status of the GPU-enabled workload

Monitor the progress of the job using the

command with the`kubectl get jobs`

`--watch`

flag. It may take a few minutes to first pull the image and process the dataset.`kubectl get jobs samples-tf-mnist-demo --watch`

When the

*COMPLETIONS*column shows*1/1*, the job has successfully finished, as shown in the following example output:`NAME COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE samples-tf-mnist-demo 0/1 3m29s 3m29s samples-tf-mnist-demo 1/1 3m10s 3m36s`

Exit the

`kubectl --watch`

process with*Ctrl-C*.Get the name of the pod using the

command.`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get pods --selector app=samples-tf-mnist-demo`

View the output of the GPU-enabled workload using the

command.`kubectl logs`

`kubectl logs samples-tf-mnist-demo-smnr6`

The following condensed example output of the pod logs confirms that the appropriate GPU device,

`Tesla K80`

, has been discovered:`2019-05-16 16:08:31.258328: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:137] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA 2019-05-16 16:08:31.396846: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1030] Found device 0 with properties: name: Tesla K80 major: 3 minor: 7 memoryClockRate(GHz): 0.8235 pciBusID: 2fd7:00:00.0 totalMemory: 11.17GiB freeMemory: 11.10GiB 2019-05-16 16:08:31.396886: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1120] Creating TensorFlow device (/device:GPU:0) -> (device: 0, name: Tesla K80, pci bus id: 2fd7:00:00.0, compute capability: 3.7) 2019-05-16 16:08:36.076962: I tensorflow/stream_executor/dso_loader.cc:139] successfully opened CUDA library libcupti.so.8.0 locally Successfully downloaded train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz 9912422 bytes.

## Upgrading a node pool

Whether you want to [update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) or [upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) your node pools, you might notice that there is no `--gpu-driver`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. You can use multiple Kubernetes actions to deploy to containers from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - A GitHub account. If you don't have one,
[sign up for free](https://github.com/join).- When using GitHub Actions, you need to configure the integration between Azure and your GitHub repository. To configure the integration, see
[Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure](/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux).

- When using GitHub Actions, you need to configure the integration between Azure and your GitHub repository. To configure the integration, see
- An existing AKS cluster with an attached ACR. If you don't have one, see
[Authenticate with ACR from AKS](cluster-container-registry-integration).

## GitHub Actions for AKS

With GiHub Actions, you can automate your software development workflows from within GitHub. For more information, see [GitHub Actions for Azure](/en-us/azure/developer/github/github-actions).

action to use OIDC. For more information, see [Set up Azure Login with OpenID Connect authentication](/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect).

### Fork and update the repository

Navigate to the

[Azure Vote](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis)repository and select**Fork**.Update the

`azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml`

to use your ACR for the`azure-vote-front`

image. Replace`<registryName>`

with the name of your registry.`... containers: - name: azure-vote-front image: <registryName>.azurecr.io/azuredocs/azure-vote-front:v1 ...`

Commit the updated

`azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml`

to your repository.

### Create secrets

Create a service principal to access your resource group with the

`Contributor`

role using thecommand. Replace`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`

with the subscription ID of your Azure account and`<RESOURCE_GROUP>`

with the name of the resource group containing your ACR.`az ad sp create-for-rbac \ --name "ghActionAzureVote" \ --scope /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP> \ --role Contributor \ --json-auth`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`{ "clientId": <clientId>, "clientSecret": <clientSecret>, "subscriptionId": <subscriptionId>, "tenantId": <tenantId>, ... }`

Navigate to your GitHub repository settings and select

**Security**>**Secrets and variables**>**Actions**.For each secret, select

**New Repository Secret**and enter the name and value of the secret.Secret name Secret value AZURE_CREDENTIALS The entire JSON output from the `az ad sp create-for-rbac`

command.service_principal The value of `<clientId>`

.service_principal_password The value of `<clientSecret>`

.subscription The value of `<subscriptionId>`

.tenant The value of `<tenantId>`

.registry The name of your registry. repository azuredocs resource_group The name of your resource group. cluster_name The name of your cluster.

For more information about creating secrets, see [Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Create actions file

In your repository, create a

`.github/workflows/main.yml`

and paste in the following contents:`name: build_deploy_aks on: push: paths: - "azure-vote/**" jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout source code uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: ACR build id: build-push-acr uses: azure/acr-build@v1 with: service_principal: ${{ secrets.service_principal }} service_principal_password: ${{ secrets.service_principal_password }} tenant: ${{ secrets.tenant }} registry: ${{ secrets.registry }} repository: ${{ secrets.repository }} image: azure-vote-front folder: azure-vote branch: master tag: ${{ github.sha }} - name: Azure login id: login uses: azure/login@v1.4.3 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Set AKS context id: set-context uses: azure/aks-set-context@v3 with: resource-group: '${{ secrets.resource_group }}' cluster-name: '${{ secrets.cluster_name }}' - name: Setup kubectl id: install-kubectl uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3 - name: Deploy to AKS id: deploy-aks uses: Azure/k8s-deploy@v4 with: namespace: 'default' manifests: | azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml images: '${{ secrets.registry }}.azurecr.io/${{ secrets.repository }}/azure-vote-front:${{ github.sha }}' pull-images: false`

The

`on`

section contains the event that triggers the action. In the example file, the action triggers when a change is pushed to the`azure-vote`

directory.The

`steps`

section contains each distinct action:*Checkout source code*uses the[GitHub Actions Checkout Action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)to clone the repository.*ACR build*uses the[Azure Container Registry Build Action](https://github.com/Azure/acr-build)to build the image and upload it to your registry.*Azure login*uses the[Azure Login Action](https://github.com/Azure/login)to sign in to your Azure account.*Set AKS context*uses the[Azure AKS Set Context Action](https://github.com/Azure/aks-set-context)to set the context for your AKS cluster.*Setup kubectl*uses the[Azure AKS Setup Kubectl Action](https://github.com/Azure/setup-kubectl)to install kubectl on your runner.*Deploy to AKS*uses the[Azure Kubernetes Deploy Action](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-deploy)to deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster.

Commit the

`.github/workflows/main.yml`

file to your repository.To confirm the action is working, update the

`azure-vote/azure-vote/config_file.cfg`

with the following contents:`# UI Configurations TITLE = 'Azure Voting App' VOTE1VALUE = 'Fish' VOTE2VALUE = 'Dogs' SHOWHOST = 'false'`

Commit the updated

`azure-vote/azure-vote/config_file.cfg`

to your repository.In your repository, select

**Actions**and confirm a workflow is running. Then, confirm the workflow has a green checkmark and the updated application is deployed to your cluster.

# Troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion for a Standard Load Balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

If you know that you're starting many outbound TCP or UDP connections to the same destination IP address and port, and you observe failing outbound connections or support notifies you that you're exhausting SNAT ports, you have several general mitigation options. Review these options and decide what's best for your scenario. It's possible that one or more can help manage your scenario. For detailed information, review the [outbound connections troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/troubleshoot-outbound-connection).

The root cause of SNAT exhaustion is frequently an anti-pattern for how outbound connectivity is established, managed, or configurable timers changed from their default values.

This article helps you troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion issues when using a Standard Load Balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Steps to troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion

Use the following steps to troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion:

- Check if your connections remain idle for a long time and rely on the default idle timeout for releasing that port. If so, the default timeout of 30 minutes might need to be reduced for your scenario.
- Investigate how your application creates outbound connectivity (for example: code review or packet capture).
- Determine if this activity is expected behavior or whether the application is misbehaving. Use
[metrics](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-diagnostics)and[logs](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/monitor-load-balancer)in Azure Monitor to substantiate your findings. For example, use the "Failed" category for SNAT connections metric. - Evaluate if appropriate
[design patterns](#snat-port-exhaustion-design-patterns)are followed. - Evaluate if SNAT port exhaustion should be mitigated with
[more outbound IP addresses and allocated outbound ports](configure-load-balancer-standard#configure-the-allocated-outbound-ports).

## SNAT port exhaustion design patterns

Take advantage of connection reuse and connection pooling whenever possible. These patterns help you avoid resource exhaustion problems and result in predictable behavior.

- Atomic requests (one request per connection) generally aren't a good design choice. Such anti-patterns limit scale, reduce performance, and decrease reliability. Instead, reuse HTTP/S connections to reduce the numbers of connections and associated SNAT ports. The application scale increases and performance improves because of reduced handshakes, overhead, and cryptographic operation cost when using TLS.
- If you're using out of cluster/custom DNS, or custom upstream servers on coreDNS, keep in mind that DNS can introduce many individual flows at volume when the client isn't caching the DNS resolvers result. Make sure to customize coreDNS first instead of using custom DNS servers and to define a good caching value.
- UDP flows (for example, DNS lookups) allocate SNAT ports during the idle timeout. The longer the idle timeout, the higher the pressure on SNAT ports. Use short idle timeout (for example, 4 minutes).
- Use connection pools to shape your connection volume.
- Never silently abandon a TCP flow and rely on TCP timers to clean up flow. If you don't let TCP explicitly close the connection, state remains allocated at intermediate systems and endpoints, and it makes SNAT ports unavailable for other connections. This pattern can trigger application failures and SNAT exhaustion.
- Don't change OS-level TCP close related timer values without expert knowledge of impact. While the TCP stack recovers, your application performance can be negatively affected when the endpoints of a connection have mismatched expectations. Wishing to change timers is usually a sign of an underlying design problem. Review following recommendations.

# Create a multi-instance GPU node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Certain NVIDIA GPUs can be divided in up to seven independent instances. Each instance has its own Stream Multiprocessor (SM), which is responsible for executing instructions in parallel, and GPU memory. For more information on GPU partitioning, see [NVIDIA MIG](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/).

This article walks you through how to create a multi-instance GPU node pool using a MIG-compatible VM size in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Prerequisites and limitations

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, you can
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Kubernetes command-line client,
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), installed and configured. If you use Azure Cloud Shell,`kubectl`

is already installed. If you want to install it locally, you can use thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

- Helm v3 installed and configured. For more information, see
[Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - Multi-instance GPU is currently supported on the
`Standard_NC40ads_H100_v5`

,`Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5`

, and A100 GPU VM sizes on AKS.

## GPU instance profiles

GPU instance profiles define how GPUs are partitioned. The following table shows the available GPU instance profile for the `Standard_ND96asr_v4`

:

| Profile name | Fraction of SM | Fraction of memory | Number of instances created |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIG 1g.5gb | 1/7 | 1/8 | 7 |
| MIG 2g.10gb | 2/7 | 2/8 | 3 |
| MIG 3g.20gb | 3/7 | 4/8 | 2 |
| MIG 4g.20gb | 4/7 | 4/8 | 1 |
| MIG 7g.40gb | 7/7 | 8/8 | 1 |

As an example, the GPU instance profile of `MIG 1g.5gb`

indicates that each GPU instance has 1g SM (streaming multiprocessors) and 5gb memory. In this case, the GPU is partitioned into seven instances.

The available GPU instance profiles available for this VM size include `MIG1g`

, `MIG2g`

, `MIG3g`

, `MIG4g`

, and `MIG7g`

.

Important

You can't change the applied GPU instance profile after node pool creation.

## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location southcentralus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


## Create a multi-instance GPU node pool

You can use either the Azure CLI or an HTTP request to the ARM API to create the node pool.

Create a multi-instance GPU node pool using the

command and specify the GPU instance profile. The example below creates a node pool with the`az aks nodepool add`

`Standard_ND96asr_v4`

MIG-compatible GPU VM size.`az aks nodepool add \ --name aksMigNode \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --node-vm-size Standard_ND96asr_v4 \ --node-count 1 \ --gpu-instance-profile MIG1g`


## Determine multi-instance GPU (MIG) strategy

Before you install the NVIDIA plugins, you need to specify which multi-instance GPU (MIG) strategy to use for GPU partitioning: *Single strategy* or *Mixed strategy*. The two strategies don't affect how you execute CPU workloads, but how GPU resources are displayed.

**Single strategy**: The single strategy treats every GPU instance as a GPU. If you use this strategy, the GPU resources are displayed as`nvidia.com/gpu: 1`

.**Mixed strategy**: The mixed strategy exposes the GPU instances and the GPU instance profile. If you use this strategy, the GPU resource are displayed as`nvidia.com/mig1g.5gb: 1`

.

## Install the NVIDIA device plugin and GPU feature discovery (GFD) components

Set your MIG strategy as an environment variable. You can use either single or mixed strategy.

`# Single strategy export MIG_STRATEGY=single # Mixed strategy export MIG_STRATEGY=mixed`

Add the NVIDIA device plugin helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

and`helm repo update`

commands.`helm repo add nvdp https://nvidia.github.io/k8s-device-plugin helm repo update`

Install the NVIDIA device plugin using the

`helm install`

command.`helm install nvdp nvdp/nvidia-device-plugin \ --version=0.17.0 \ --set migStrategy=${MIG_STRATEGY} \ --set gfd.enabled=true \ --namespace nvidia-device-plugin \ --create-namespace`


Note

Helm installation of the NVIDIA device plugin consolidates the Kubernetes device plugin and GFD repositories. Separate helm installation of the GFD software component is not recommended when using AKS-managed multi-instance GPU.

## Confirm multi-instance GPU capability

Verify the

`kubectl`

connection to your cluster using the`kubectl get`

command to return a list of cluster nodes.`kubectl get nodes -o wide`

Confirm the node has multi-instance GPU capability using the

`kubectl describe node`

command. The following example command describes the node named*aksMigNode*, which uses MIG1g as the GPU instance profile.`kubectl describe node aksMigNode`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`# Single strategy output Allocatable: nvidia.com/gpu: 56 # Mixed strategy output Allocatable: nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb: 56`


## Schedule work

The following examples are based on CUDA base image **version 12.1.1** for Ubuntu **22.04**, tagged as `12.1.1-base-ubuntu22.04`

.

### Single strategy

Create a file named

`single-strategy-example.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: nvidia-single spec: containers: - name: nvidia-single image: nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-base-ubuntu22.04 command: ["/bin/sh"] args: ["-c","sleep 1000"] resources: limits: "nvidia.com/gpu": 1`

Deploy the application using the

`kubectl apply`

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply -f single-strategy-example.yaml`

Verify the allocated GPU devices using the

`kubectl exec`

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl exec nvidia-single -- nvidia-smi -L`

The following example resembles output showing successfully created deployments and services:

`GPU 0: NVIDIA A100 40GB PCIe (UUID: GPU-48aeb943-9458-4282-da24-e5f49e0db44b) MIG 1g.5gb Device 0: (UUID: MIG-fb42055e-9e53-5764-9278-438605a3014c) MIG 1g.5gb Device 1: (UUID: MIG-3d4db13e-c42d-5555-98f4-8b50389791bc) MIG 1g.5gb Device 2: (UUID: MIG-de819d17-9382-56a2-b9ca-aec36c88014f) MIG 1g.5gb Device 3: (UUID: MIG-50ab4b32-92db-5567-bf6d-fac646fe29f2) MIG 1g.5gb Device 4: (UUID: MIG-7b6b1b6e-5101-58a4-b5f5-21563789e62e) MIG 1g.5gb Device 5: (UUID: MIG-14549027-dd49-5cc0-bca4-55e67011bd85) MIG 1g.5gb Device 6: (UUID: MIG-37e055e8-8890-567f-a646-ebf9fde3ce7a)`


### Mixed strategy

Create a file named

`mixed-strategy-example.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: nvidia-mixed spec: containers: - name: nvidia-mixed image: nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-base-ubuntu22.04 command: ["/bin/sh"] args: ["-c","sleep 100"] resources: limits: "nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb": 1`

Deploy the application using the

`kubectl apply`

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply -f mixed-strategy-example.yaml`

Verify the allocated GPU devices using the

`kubectl exec`

# Recommended active-active high availability solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. In the event of a disaster that causes the region to become unavailable, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

While there are multiple patterns that can provide recoverability for an AKS solution, this guide outlines the recommended active-active high availability solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with both clusters actively serving traffic.

Note

The following use case can be considered standard practice within AKS. It has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Active-active high availability solution overview

This solution relies on two identical AKS clusters configured to actively serve traffic. You place a global traffic manager, such as [Azure Front Door](/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview), in front of the two clusters to distribute traffic across them. You must consistently configure the clusters to host an instance of all applications required for the solution to function.

Availability zones are another way to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your AKS cluster within the same region. Availability zones allow you to distribute your cluster nodes across multiple isolated locations within an Azure region. This way, if one zone goes down due to a power outage, hardware failure, or network issue, your cluster can continue to run and serve your applications. Availability zones also improve the performance and scalability of your cluster by reducing the latency and contention among nodes. To set up availability zones for your AKS cluster, you need to specify the zone numbers when creating or updating your node pools. For more information, see [What are Azure availability zones?](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview)

Note

Many regions support availability zones. Consider using regions with availability zones to provide more resiliency and availability for your workloads. For more information, see [Recover from a region-wide service disruption](/en-us/azure/architecture/resiliency/recovery-loss-azure-region).

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented when hosting stateless applications and/or with other technologies also deployed across both regions, such as horizontal scaling. In scenarios where the hosted application is reliant on resources, such as databases, that are actively in only one region, we recommend instead implementing an [active-passive solution](active-passive-solution) for potential cost savings, as active-passive has more downtime than active-active.

## Components

The active-active high availability solution uses many Azure services. This section covers only the components unique to this multi-cluster architecture. For more information on the remaining components, see the [AKS baseline architecture](/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks?toc=%2Fazure%2Faks%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Faks%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. During normal operations, your Azure Front Door configuration routes network traffic between all regions. If one region becomes unavailable, traffic routes to a region with the fastest load time for the user.

**Hub-spoke network per region**: A regional hub-spoke network pair is deployed for each regional AKS instance. [Azure Firewall Manager](/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/overview) policies manage the firewall policies across all regions.

**Regional key store**: You provision [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in each region to store sensitive values and keys specific to the AKS instance and to support services found in that region.

**Azure Front Door**: [Azure Front Door](/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) load balances and routes traffic to a regional [Azure Application Gateway](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) instance, which sits in front of each AKS cluster. Azure Front Door allows for *layer seven* global routing.

**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

**Container Registry**: The container images for the workload are stored in a managed container registry. With this solution, a single [Azure Container Registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) instance is used for all Kubernetes instances in the cluster. Geo-replication for Azure Container Registry enables you to replicate images to the selected Azure regions and provides continued access to images even if a region experiences an outage.

## Failover process

If a service or service component becomes unavailable in one region, traffic should be routed to a region where that service is available. A multi-region architecture includes many different failure points. In this section, we cover the potential failure points.

### Application Pods (Regional)

A Kubernetes deployment object creates multiple replicas of a pod (*ReplicaSet*). If one is unavailable, traffic is routed between the remaining replicas. The Kubernetes *ReplicaSet* attempts to keep the specified number of replicas up and running. If one instance goes down, a new instance should be recreated. [Liveness probes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe) can check the state of the application or process running in the pod. If the pod is unresponsive, the liveness probe removes the pod, which forces the *ReplicaSet* to create a new instance.

For more information, see [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

### Application Pods (Global)

When an entire region becomes unavailable, the pods in the cluster are no longer available to serve requests. In this case, the Azure Front Door instance routes all traffic to the remaining health regions. The Kubernetes clusters and pods in these regions continue to serve requests. To compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster, keep in mind the following guidance:

- Make sure network and compute resources are right sized to absorb any sudden increase in traffic due to region failover. For example, when using Azure Container Network Interface (CNI), make sure you have a subnet that can support all pod IPs with a spiked traffic load.
- Use the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler)to increase the pod replica count to compensate for the increased regional demand. - Use the AKS
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to increase the Kubernetes instance node counts to compensate for the increased regional demand.

### Kubernetes node pools (Regional)

Occasionally, localized failure can occur to compute resources, such as power becoming unavailable in a single rack of Azure servers. To protect your AKS nodes from becoming a single point regional failure, use [Azure Availability Zones](availability-zones). Availability zones ensure that AKS nodes in each availability zone are physically separated from those defined in another availability zones.

### Kubernetes node pools (Global)

In a complete regional failure, Azure Front Door routes traffic to the remaining healthy regions. Again, make sure to compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster.

## Failover testing strategy

While there are no mechanisms currently available within AKS to take down an entire region of deployment for testing purposes, [Azure Chaos Studio](/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-overview) offers the ability to create a chaos experiment on your cluster.

# Access a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the command invoke or Run command feature

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you access a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you need to connect to the cluster from the cluster virtual network (VNet), a peered network, or a configured private endpoint. These approaches require extra configuration, such as setting up a VPN or Express Route.

With the Azure CLI, you can use `command invoke`

to access private clusters without the need to configure a VPN or Express Route. `command invoke`

allows you to remotely invoke commands, like `kubectl`

and `helm`

, on your private cluster through the Azure API without directly connecting to the cluster. The RBAC actions `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/runcommand/action`

and `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/commandResults/read`

control the permissions for using `command invoke`

.

With the Azure portal, you can use the `Run command`

feature to run commands on your private cluster. The `Run command`

feature uses the same `command invoke`

functionality to run commands on your cluster. The pod created by `Run command`

provides `kubectl`

and `helm`

for operating your cluster. `jq`

, `xargs`

, `grep`

, and `awk`

are available for Bash support.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to run `kubectl`

commands in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#run-cluster-commands).

## Prerequisites

**System and permission requirements**

| Requirement type | Specification | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
Azure CLI version |
2.24.0 or later | Use the
`az --version` |

**Private AKS cluster**[Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters).**RBAC actions**`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/runcommand/action`

and `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/commandResults/read`

[Azure CLI command.](/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-list)`az role assignment list`

**Run command pod resource specifications**

| Resource type | Value | Impact |
|---|---|---|
CPU requests |
200m | Minimum CPU reserved for command pod |
Memory requests |
500Mi | Minimum memory reserved for command pod |
CPU limits |
500m | Maximum CPU available to command pod |
Memory limits |
1Gi | Maximum memory available to command pod |
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API timeout |
60 seconds | Maximum time for pod scheduling |
Output size limit |
512kB | Maximum command output size |

## Limitations and considerations

**Design scope**

**Not for programmatic access**: Use Bastion, VPN, or ExpressRoute for automated API calls.**Pod scheduling dependency**: Requires sufficient cluster resources (see the[resource specifications](#prerequisites)).**Output limitations**:*exitCode*and*text*only, no API-level details.**Network constraints apply**: Subject to cluster networking and security restrictions.

**Potential failure points**

- Pod scheduling failure if nodes are resource-constrained.
- ARM API timeout (60 seconds) if pod can't be scheduled quickly.
- Output truncation if response exceeds 512kB limit.

## Use `command invoke`

on a private AKS cluster with the Azure CLI

Set environment variables for your resource group and cluster name to use in subsequent commands.

`export AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>"`

These environment variables allow you to run AKS commands without having to rewrite their names.


### Use `command invoke`

to run a single command

Run a single command on your cluster using the

command and the`az aks command invoke`

`--command`

parameter to specify the command to run. The following example gets the pods in the`kube-system`

namespace.`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \ --command "kubectl get pods -n kube-system"`


### Use `command invoke`

to run multiple commands

Run multiple commands on your cluster using the

command and the`az aks command invoke`

`--command`

parameter to specify the commands to run. The following example adds the Bitnami Helm chart repository, updates the repository, and installs the`nginx`

chart.`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \ --command "helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami && helm repo update && helm install my-release bitnami/nginx"`


### Use `command invoke`

to run commands with an attached file

If you want to run a command with an attached file, the file must exist and be accessible in your current working directory. In the following example, we create a minimal deployment file for demonstration.

Create a Kubernetes manifest file named

`deployment.yaml`

. The following example deployment file deploys an`nginx`

pod.`cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-demo spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx-demo template: metadata: labels: app: nginx-demo spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.21.6 ports: - containerPort: 80 EOF`

Apply the deployment file to your cluster using the

command with the`az aks command invoke`

`--file`

parameter to attach the file. The following example applies the`deployment.yaml`

file to the`default`

namespace.`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \ --command "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n default" \ --file deployment.yaml`


### Use `command invoke`

to run commands with all files in the current directory

Note

Use only small, necessary files to avoid exceeding system size limits.

In the following example, we create two minimal deployment files for demonstration.

Create two Kubernetes manifest files named

`deployment.yaml`

and`configmap.yaml`

. The following example deployment files deploy an`nginx`

pod and create a ConfigMap with a welcome message.`cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx-demo spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx-demo template: metadata: labels: app: nginx-demo spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:1.21.6 ports: - containerPort: 80 EOF cat <<EOF > configmap.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nginx-config data: welcome-message: "Hello from configmap" EOF`

Apply the deployment files to your cluster using the

command with the`az aks command invoke`

`--file`

parameter to attach the file. The following example applies the`deployment.yaml`

and`configmap.yaml`

files to the`default`

namespace.`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \ --command "kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -f configmap.yaml -n default" \ --file deployment.yaml \ --file configmap.yaml`


## Use `Run command`

on a private AKS cluster in the Azure portal

You can use the following `kubectl`

commands with the `Run command`

feature:

`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get deployments`

`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl describe nodes`

`kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`

`kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>`

`kubectl apply -f <file-name>`


### Use `Run command`

to run a single command

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your private cluster.
- From the service menu, under
**Kubernetes resources**, select**Run command**. - Enter the command you want to run and select
**Run**.

### Use `Run command`

to run commands with attached files

In the Azure portal, navigate to your private cluster.

From the service menu, under

**Kubernetes resources**, select**Run command**.Select

**Attach files**>**Browse for files**.Select the file or files you want to attach, and then select

**Attach**.Enter the command you want to run and select

**Run**.

## Disable `Run command`


You can disable the `Run command`

feature by setting [ .properties.apiServerAccessProfile.disableRunCommand to true](/en-us/rest/api/aks/managed-clusters/create-or-update).


## Troubleshoot `command invoke`

issues

For information on the most common issues with `az aks command invoke`

and how to fix them, see [Resolve az aks command invoke failures](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/resolve-az-aks-command-invoke-failures).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

Support for Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) on **Windows** nodes in AKS ends on **September 30, 2026**.

This change applies only to customers already onboarded to NPM. **Subscriptions that aren't registered with this feature will no longer be able to onboard**. Existing onboarded customers can continue using NPM until the end-of-support date.

To ensure your setup continues to receive support, security updates, and deployment compatibility, explore alternative options like [Network Security Groups (NSGs)](concepts-network) on the node level or open-source tools like [Project Calico](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico/).

Important

Support for Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) on **Linux** nodes in AKS ends on **September 30, 2026**.

To avoid service disruptions, you need to [migrate AKS clusters running Linux nodes from NPM to Cilium Network Policy](migrate-from-npm-to-cilium-network-policy) by the end-of-support date.

Important

Support for kubenet networking on AKS clusters ends on **March 31, 2028**.

To avoid service disruptions, you need to upgrade to [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) by the end-of-support date.

Install a network policy engine and create Kubernetes network policies to control the flow of traffic between pods in AKS clusters.

## Overview of network policy

By default, all pods in an AKS cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations. To improve security, you can define rules that control the flow of traffic.

Network policy is a Kubernetes specification that defines access policies for communication between pods. When you use network policies, you define an ordered set of rules to send and receive traffic. You apply the rules to a collection of pods that match one or more label selectors.

You define the network policy rules as YAML manifests, and you can include them in wider manifests that also create a deployment or service.

## Network policy options in AKS

Azure provides three network policy engines for enforcing network policies:

**Cilium**(for AKS clusters using[Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](azure-cni-powered-by-cilium))**Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)****Calico**(an open-source network and network security solution founded by[Tigera](https://www.tigera.io/))

We recommend using Cilium. Cilium enforces network policy on the traffic using Linux Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), which is more efficient than *IPTables*.

To enforce the specified policies, Azure NPM uses *IPTables* for Linux and *Host Network Service (HNS) ACLPolicies* for Windows. Policies are translated into sets of allowed and disallowed IP pairs. These pairs are then programmed as `IPTable`

or `HNS ACLPolicy`

filter rules.

## Differences between network policy engines: Cilium, Azure NPM, and Calico

| Network policy engine | Supported platforms | Supported networking options | Kubernetes specification compliance | Other features | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cilium | Linux | Azure CNI | Supports all policy types |
|

[Calico Network Policy issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4038).## Azure Network Policy Manager limitations (Linux)

Azure NPM for Linux has the following limitations:

- Scaling beyond
*250 nodes*and*20,000 pods*isn't supported. If you attempt to scale beyond these limits, you might experience*Out of Memory (OOM)*errors. For better scalability and IPv6 support, we recommend using or upgrading to[Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](update-azure-cni)for your network policy engine. - IPv6 isn't supported. Otherwise, it fully supports the network policy specifications in Linux.

## Azure Network Policy Manager limitations (Windows)

Azure NPM for Windows doesn't support the following features of the network policy specifications:

- Named ports.
- Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
- Negative match label or namespace selectors. For example, all labels except
`debug=true`

. `except`

classless interdomain routing (CIDR) blocks (CIDR with exceptions).

## Known issues with Azure Network Policy Manager

You might experience temporary connectivity issues for new connections to/from pods on impacted nodes when either editing or deleting a "large enough" network policy. Hitting this race condition never impacts active connections.

If this race condition occurs for a node, the Azure NPM pod on that node enters a state where it can't update security rules, which might lead to unexpected connectivity for new connections to/from pods on the impacted node. To mitigate the issue, the Azure NPM pod automatically restarts ~15 seconds after entering this state. While Azure NPM is rebooting on the impacted node, it deletes all security rules, then reapplies security rules for all network policies. While all the security rules are being reapplied, there's a chance of temporary, unexpected connectivity for new connections to/from pods on the impacted node.

To limit the chance of hitting this race condition, you can reduce the size of the network policy. This issue is most likely to happen for a network policy with several `ipBlock`

sections. A network policy with *four or fewer* `ipBlock`

sections is less likely to hit the issue.

## Load balancer services and network policies

Kubernetes service routing for both inbound and outbound services often involves rewriting the source and destination IPs on traffic that's being processed, including traffic that comes into the cluster from a `LoadBalancer`

service. This rewrite behavior means that the network policies might not properly process traffic being received from or sent to an external service. For more information, see the [Kubernetes Network Policies documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

To restrict what sources can send traffic to a load balancer service, use `spec.loadBalancerSourceRanges`

to configure traffic blocking that applies before any rewrites occur. For more information, see the [AKS Standard load balancer documentation](/en-us/azure/aks/load-balancer-standard#restrict-inbound-traffic-to-specific-ip-ranges).

## Before you begin

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later installed and configured. Find the version using the `az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Instead of using a system-assigned identity, you can also use a user-assigned identity. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

## Create an AKS cluster with Azure Network Policy Manager (Linux)

Set environment variables for the resource group name, cluster name, and location. Replace the values as needed.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP=myResourceGroup export CLUSTER_NAME=myAKSCluster export LOCATION=eastus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

and specify`az aks create`

`azure`

for the`network-plugin`

and`network-policy`

.`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-policy azure \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create an AKS cluster with Azure Network Policy Manager (Windows Server 2022 (preview))

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `WindowsNetworkPolicyPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`WindowsNetworkPolicyPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "WindowsNetworkPolicyPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "WindowsNetworkPolicyPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create administrator credentials for Windows Server containers

Create a username to use as administrator credentials for your Windows Server containers on your cluster. The following command prompts you for a username. Set it to

`WINDOWS_USERNAME`

.`echo "Please enter the username to use as administrator credentials for Windows Server containers on your cluster: " && read WINDOWS_USERNAME`


### Create the AKS cluster

Set environment variables for the resource group name, cluster name, and location. Replace the values as needed.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP=myResourceGroup export CLUSTER_NAME=myAKSCluster export LOCATION=eastus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

and specify`az aks create`

`azure`

for the`network-plugin`

and`network-policy`

.`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --windows-admin-username $WINDOWS_USERNAME \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-policy azure \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create an AKS cluster with Calico

Create an AKS cluster using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and specify

`--network-plugin azure`

and `--network-policy calico`

. Specifying `--network-policy calico`

enables Calico on both Linux and Windows node pools.If you plan on adding Windows node pools to your cluster, include the `windows-admin-username`

and `windows-admin-password`

parameters that meet the [Windows Server password requirements](/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements#reference). To create administrator credentials for Windows Server containers on your cluster, see [Create administrator credentials for Windows Server containers](#create-administrator-credentials-for-windows-server-containers).

Important

At this time, using Calico network policies with Windows nodes is available on new clusters using Kubernetes version 1.20 or later with Calico 3.17.2 and requires that you use Azure CNI networking. Windows nodes on AKS clusters with Calico enabled also have Floating IP enabled by default.

For clusters with only Linux node pools running Kubernetes 1.20 with earlier versions of Calico, the Calico version automatically upgrades to 3.17.2.

## Install Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico on an existing cluster

Warning

Keep the following information in mind when installing Azure NPM or Calico on an existing cluster:

- The upgrade process triggers each node pool to be reimaged simultaneously. Upgrading each node pool separately isn't supported.
- Within each node pool, nodes follow the same reimaging process as standard Kubernetes version upgrade operations. This behavior means that buffer nodes are temporarily added to minimize disruption to running applications during the node reimaging process. Any disruptions that might occur are similar to what you might encounter during a node image upgrade or
[Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster).

The following information applies to upgrades from kubenet with Calico to Azure CNI Overlay with Calico:

- In kubenet clusters with Calico enabled, Calico is used as both a CNI and network policy engine.
- In Azure CNI clusters, Calico is used only for network policy enforcement, not as a CNI. This can cause a short delay between when the pod starts and when Calico allows outbound traffic from the pod.

Update an existing cluster to install Azure NPM or Calico using the

command and specifying`az aks update`

`azure`

or`calico`

for the`--network-policy`

parameter. The following example command shows how to install either Azure NPM:`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --network-policy azure`


## Upgrade an existing cluster with Azure NPM or Calico to Cilium

To upgrade an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, see [Upgrade an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane)

## Connect to the AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Verify network policy setup

To begin verification of network policy, you create a sample application and set traffic rules.

Create a namespace named

`demo`

to run the sample pods using the`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace demo`

Create a pod named

`server`

to server on TCP port 80 using the`kubectl run`

command.`kubectl run server -n demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 --labels="app=server" --port=80 --command -- /agnhost serve-hostname --tcp --http=false --port "80"`

Create a pod named

`client`

to run Bash using the`kubectl run`

command.`kubectl run -it client -n demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 --command -- bash`

Note

If you want to schedule the client or server on a particular node, add the following bit before the

`--command`

argument in the pod creationcommand:`kubectl run`

`--overrides='{"spec": { "nodeSelector": {"kubernetes.io/os": "linux|windows"}}}'`

.In a separate window, get the IP address of the

`server`

pod using the`kubectl get pod`

command.`kubectl get pod --output=wide -n demo`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES server 1/1 Running 0 30s 10.224.0.72 akswin22000001 <none> <none>`


## Test connectivity with network policies

Tip

To test connectivity without network policies, run the following command in the client shell: `/agnhost connect <server-ip>:80 --timeout=3s --protocol=tcp`

. Replace `<server-ip>`

with the IP address of the server pod. If the connection is successful, there's no output.

Create a file named

`demo-policy.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: demo-policy namespace: demo spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: server ingress: - from: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: client ports: - port: 80 protocol: TCP`

Apply the network policy manifest using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply –f demo-policy.yaml`

In the client shell, verify connectivity with the server using the following

`/agnhost`

command:`/agnhost connect <server-ip>:80 --timeout=3s --protocol=tcp`

Connectivity with traffic is blocked because the server is labeled with

`app=server`

, but the client isn't labeled. Your output should resemble the following example output:`TIMEOUT`

Label the

`client`

and verify connectivity with the server using the`kubectl label`

command.`kubectl label pod client -n demo app=client`

If the connection is successful, there's no output.


## Migrate to self-managed Calico

AKS only supports Calico for standard Kubernetes network policies and doesn't test other features. If you want to move to self-managed Calico, follow the Tigera instructions at [Migrate from Azure-managed Calico to self-managed Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/managed-public-cloud/aks-migrate). The Tigera documentation mentions that for self-managed Calico you set `--network-policy none`

like in the [uninstall section](#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

## Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico

Note

Keep the following information in mind when uninstalling Azure NPM or Calico from a cluster:

- The uninstall process
**doesn't remove**Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Custom Resources (CRs) used by Calico. These CRDs and CRs all have names ending with either*projectcalico.org*or*tigera.io*. You can manually remove these CRDs and associated CRs*after*successfully uninstalling Calico. - The upgrade doesn't remove any network policy resources in the cluster, but the policies are no longer enforced after the uninstall process.

Remove Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico from an existing cluster using the

command and specifying`az aks update`

`none`

for the`--network-policy`

parameter.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --network-policy none`


## Clean up resources

In this article, you created a namespace and two pods and applied a network policy. If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them.

Delete the resources using the

command.`kubectl delete`

`kubectl delete namespace demo`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create one or more node pools in an AKS cluster.

Note

This feature enables more control over creating and managing multiple node pools and requires separate commands for *create/update/delete* (CRUD) operations. Previously, cluster operations through [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) or

[used the managedCluster API and were the only options to change your control plane and a single node pool. This feature exposes a separate operation set for agent pools through the agentPool API and requires use of the](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update)

`az aks update`

[command set to execute operations on an individual node pool.](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool)

`az aks nodepool`

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To deploy an ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the

`Microsoft.Resources/deployments`

resource type. For example, to deploy a virtual machine (VM), you need`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`

and`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`

permissions. For a list of roles and permissions, see[Azure built-in roles](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).Review the following requirements for each parameter:

`osTYPE`

: The operating system type. The default is Linux.`osSKU`

: Specifies the OS SKU used by the agent pool.`count`

: Number of agents (VMs) to host docker containers. Allowed values must be in the range of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) for user pools and in the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive) for system pools. The default value is 1.

After you deploy the cluster using an ARM template, you can use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to connect to the cluster and deploy the sample application.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create AKS clusters that support multiple node pools:

You can delete the system node pool if you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster. Otherwise, you can't delete the system node pool.

System pools must contain at least one node. User node pools can contain zero or more nodes.

**If you create a cluster with a single node pool, the OS type must be**. The OS SKU can be any Linux variation such as`Linux`

`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

. You can't create a cluster with a single Windows node pool. If you want to run Windows containers, you must[add a Windows node pool](#add-a-windows-server-node-pool)to the cluster after creating it with a Linux system node pool.The AKS cluster must use the Standard SKU load balancer to use multiple node pools. This feature isn't supported with Basic SKU load balancers.

The AKS cluster must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets for the nodes.

The name of a node pool can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-12 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.

All node pools must reside in the same virtual network.

You can't change the virtual machine (VM) size of a node pool after you create it.

When you create multiple node pools at cluster creation time, the Kubernetes versions for the node pools must match the version set for the control plane. You can make updates after provisioning the cluster using per node pool operations.


## Create specialized node pools

To learn how to create specialized node pools, see the following articles:

[Add an Azure Spot node pool to an AKS cluster](spot-node-pool)[Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an AKS cluster](virtual-machines-node-pools)[Add a dedicated system node pool to an AKS cluster](use-system-pools#add-a-dedicated-system-node-pool-to-an-existing-aks-cluster)[Enabled Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) on an AKS node pool](enable-fips-nodes)[Add a node pool with a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) on an AKS cluster](use-cvm)[Create node pools with unique subnets in AKS](node-pool-unique-subnet)[Add a generation 2 VM node pool to an AKS cluster](generation-2-vms)[Add a node pool with Artifact Streaming to an AKS cluster](artifact-streaming)[Add Windows Server node pools with](windows-containerd)`containerd`

to an AKS cluster

## Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables in your shell to simplify the commands in this article. You can change the values to your preferred names.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="my-aks-rg" export LOCATION="eastus" export CLUSTER_NAME="my-aks-cluster" export NODE_POOL_NAME="mynodepool"`


## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using the Azure CLI

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_os-guard) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_flatcar)

Create a cluster with a single Ubuntu node pool using the

command. This step specifies two nodes in the single node pool.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --node-count 2 \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --location $LOCATION \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster.

When the cluster is ready, get the cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add a second node pool using the Azure CLI

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

Note

If you want to add a node pool that uses **Ephemeral OS disks** to your AKS cluster, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Ephemeral`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

With Ephemeral OS, you can deploy VMs and instance images up to the size of the VM cache. The default node OS disk configuration in AKS uses 128 GB, which means that you need a VM size that has a cache larger than 128 GB. The default `Standard_DS2_v2`

has a cache size of 86 GB, which isn't large enough. The `Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU has a cache size of 172 GB, which is large enough. You can also reduce the default size of the OS disk using `--node-osdisk-size`

, but keep in mind the minimum size for AKS images is 30 GB.

If you want to create node pools with **network-attached OS disks**, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Managed`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

### Add a Linux node pool

-
[Add an Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_2_ubuntu) -
[Add an Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_2_azure-linux) -
[Add an Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_os-guard) -
[Add a Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_flatcar)

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Linux`

node pool with the`Ubuntu`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes. If you don't specify an OS SKU, AKS defaults to`Ubuntu`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Linux \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --node-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to create the node pool.


### Add a Windows Server node pool

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Register the `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pool

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Windows`

node pool with the`Windows2025`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes.For more information about Windows OS, see

[Windows best practices](windows-best-practices).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Windows \ --os-sku Windows2025 \ --node-count 3`


## Check the status of your node pools

Check the status of your node pools using the

command and specify your resource group and cluster name.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using an ARM template

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

## Deploy your ARM template

- Deploy your ARM template by following the guidance in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using an ARM template](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template).

## Set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool

When creating a node pool, you can add taints, labels, or tags to it. When you add a taint, label, or tag, all nodes within that node pool also get that taint, label, or tag. We recommend applying these properties to an entire node pool instead of individual nodes. This way, you can easily manage the properties of all nodes in the node pool by updating the node pool properties instead of updating each node individually.

For specific instructions on how to set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool, use the following resources:

[Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-node-taints)[Use labels in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-labels)[Use Azure tags in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-tags)[Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations)
