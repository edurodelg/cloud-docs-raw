Important

This article aims to provide a simplistic understanding of how to identify OSM configurations and translate them to equivalent Istio configurations for migrating workloads from OSM to Istio. This by no means, is considered to be an exhaustive detailed guide.

This article provides practical guidance for mapping OSM policies to the [Istio](https://istio.io/) policies to help migrate your microservices deployments managed by OSM over to being managed by Istio. We utilize the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) as a base reference for current OSM users. The following walk-through deploys the Bookstore application. The same steps are followed and explain how to apply the OSM [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) traffic policies using the Istio equivalent.

If you are not using OSM and are new to Istio, start with [Istio's own Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to learn how to use the Istio service mesh for your applications. If you are currently using OSM, make sure you are familiar with the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) walk-through on how OSM configures traffic policies. The following walk-through does not duplicate the current documentation, and reference specific topics when relevant. You should be comfortable and fully aware of the bookstore application architecture before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- The OSM AKS add-on is uninstalled from your AKS cluster
- Any existing OSM Bookstore application, including namespaces, is uninstalled and deleted from your cluster
[Install the Istio AKS service mesh add-on](istio-deploy-addon)

## Modifications needed to the OSM Sample Bookstore Application

To allow for Istio to manage the OSM bookstore application, there are a couple of changes needed in the existing manifests. Those changes are with the bookstore and the mysql services.

### Bookstore Modifications

In the OSM Bookstore walk-through, the bookstore service is deployed along with another bookstore-v2 service to demonstrate how OSM provides traffic shifting. This deployed services allowed you to split the client (`bookbuyer`

) traffic between multiple service endpoints. The first new concept to understand how Istio handles what they refer to as [Traffic Shifting](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/).

OSM implementation of traffic shifting is based on the [SMI Traffic Split specification](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha4/traffic-split.md). The SMI Traffic Split specification requires the existence of multiple top-level services that are added as backends with the desired weight metric to shift client requests from one service to another. Istio accomplishes traffic shifting using a combination of a [Virtual Service](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) and a [Destination Rule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/). It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with both the concepts of a virtual service and destination rule.

Put simply, the Istio virtual service defines routing rules for clients that request the host (service name). Virtual Services allows for multiple versions of a deployment to be associated to one virtual service hostname for clients to target. Multiple deployments can be labeled for the same service, representing different versions of the application behind the same hostname. The Istio virtual service can then be configured to weight the request to a specific version of the service. The available versions of the service are configured to use the `subsets`

attribute in an Istio destination rule.

The modification made to the bookstore service and deployment for Istio removes the need to have an explicit second service to target, which the SMI Traffic Split needs. There's no need for another service account for the bookstore v2 service as well, since it's to be consolidated under the bookstore service. The original OSM [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest modification to Istio for both the bookstore v1 and v2 are shown in the below [Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts](#create-pods-services-and-service-accounts) section. We demonstrate how we do traffic splitting, known as traffic shifting later in the walk-through:

### MySql Modifications

Changes to the mysql stateful set are only needed in the service configuration. Under the service specification, OSM needed the `targetPort`

and `appProtocol`

attributes. These attributes are not needed for Istio. The following updated service for the mysqldb looks like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: mysqldb
labels:
app: mysqldb
service: mysqldb
spec:
ports:
- port: 3306
name: tcp
selector:
app: mysqldb
```


## Deploy the Modified Bookstore Application

Similar to the OSM Bookstore walk-through, we start with a new install of the bookstore application.

### Create the Namespaces

```
kubectl create namespace bookstore
kubectl create namespace bookbuyer
kubectl create namespace bookthief
kubectl create namespace bookwarehouse
```


### Add a namespace label for Istio sidecar injection

For OSM, using the command `osm namespace add <namespace>`

created the necessary annotations to the namespace for the OSM controller to add automatic sidecar injection. With Istio, you only need to just label a namespace to allow the Istio controller to be instructed to automatically inject the Envoy sidecar proxies.

```
kubectl label namespace bookstore istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookbuyer istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookthief istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookwarehouse istio-injection=enabled
```


### Deploy the Istio Virtual Service and Destination Rule for Bookstore

As mentioned earlier in the Bookstore Modification section, Istio handles traffic shifting utilizing a VirtualService weight attribute we configure later in the walk-through. We deploy the virtual service and destination rule for the bookstore service. We deploy only the bookstore version 1 even though the bookstore version 2 is deployed. The Istio virtual service is only supplying a route to the version 1 of bookstore. Different from how OSM handles traffic shifting (traffic split), OSM deployed another service for the bookstore version 2 application. OSM needed to set up traffic to be split between client requests using a TrafficSplit. When using traffic shifting with Istio, we can reference shifting traffic to multiple Kubernetes application deployments (versions) labeled for the same service.

In this walk-though, the deployment of both bookstore versions (v1 & v2) is deployed at the same time. Only the version 1 is reachable due to the virtual service configuration. There is no need to deploy another service for bookstore version 2, we enable a route to the bookstore version 2 later when we update the bookstore virtual service and provide the necessary weight attribute to do traffic shifting.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service

EOF
```


### Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts

We use a single manifest file that contains the modifications discussed earlier in the walk-through to deploy the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, `bookwarehouse`

, and `mysql`

applications.

kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts -n bookthief
kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookstore
kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookwarehouse
```


### View the Application UIs

Similar to the original OSM walk-through, if you have the OSM repo cloned you can utilize the port forwarding scripts to view the UIs of each application [here](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/#view-the-application-uis). For now, we are only concerned to view the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI.

```
cp .env.example .env
bash <<EOF
./scripts/port-forward-bookbuyer-ui.sh &
./scripts/port-forward-bookthief-ui.sh &
wait
EOF
```


In a browser, open up the following urls:

http://localhost:8080 - bookbuyer

http://localhost:8083 - bookthief

## Configure Istio's Traffic Policies

To maintain continuity with the original OSM Bookstore walk-through for the translation to Istio, we discuss [OSM's Permissive Traffic Policy Mode](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/traffic_policies/#permissive-traffic-policy-mode). OSM's permissive traffic policy mode was a concept of allowing or denying traffic in the mesh without any specific [SMI Traffic Access Control rule](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha3/traffic-access.md) deployed. The permissive traffic mode configuration existed to allow users to onboard applications into the mesh, while gaining mTLS encryption, without requiring explicit rules to allow applications in the mesh to communicate. The permissive traffic mode feature was to avoid breaking the communications of your application as soon as OSM managed it, and provide time to define your rules while ensuring that application communications was mTLS encrypted. This setting could be set to `true`

or `false`

via OSM's MeshConfig.

Istio handles mTLS enforcement differently. Different from OSM, Istio's permissive mode automatically configures sidecar proxies to use mTLS but allow the service to accept both plaintext and mTLS traffic. The equivalent to OSM's permissive mode configuration is to utilize Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

settings. `PeerAuthentication`

can be done granularly at the namespace or for the entire mesh. For more information on Istio's enforcement of mTLS, read the [Istio Mutual TLS Migration article](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/).

### Enforce Istio Strict Mode on Bookstore Namespaces

It is important to remember, just like OSM's permissive mode, Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

configuration is only related to the use of mTLS enforcement. Actual layer-7 policies, much like those used in OSM's HTTPRouteGroups, is handled using Istio's AuthorizationPolicy configurations you see later in the walk-through.

We granularly put the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, and `bookwarehouse`

namespaces in Istio's mTLS strict mode.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookthief
namespace: bookthief
spec:

---

---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookwarehouse
namespace: bookwarehouse
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
```


### Deploy Istio Access Control Policies

Similar to OSM's [SMI Traffic Target](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha2/traffic-access.md) and [SMI Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-specs/v1alpha4/traffic-specs.md) resources to define access control and routing policies for the applications to communicate, Istio accomplishes these similar fine-grain controls by using `AuthorizationPolicy`

configurations.

Let's walk through translating the bookstore TrafficTarget policy, which specifically allows the `bookbuyer`

to communicate to it, with only certain layer-7 path, headers, and methods. The following is a portion of the [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest.

```
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
destination:
kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
rules:
- kind: HTTPRouteGroup
name: bookstore-service-routes
matches:
- buy-a-book
- books-bought
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
---
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


If you notice under the TrafficTarget policy, in the spec is where you can explicitly define what source service can communicate with a destination service. We can see that we are allowing the source `bookbuyer`

to be authorized to communicate to the destination bookstore. If we translate the service-to-service authorization from an OSM `TrafficTarget`

configuration to an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

, it looks like this below:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
```


In the Istio's `AuthorizationPolicy`

, you notice how the OSM TrafficTarget policy destination service is mapped to the selector label match and the namespace the service resides in. The source service is shown under the rules section where there is a source/principles attribute that maps to the service account name for the `bookbuyer`

service.

In addition to just the source/destination configuration in the OSM TrafficTarget, OSM binds the use of an HTTPRouteGroup to further define the layer-7 authorization the source has access to. We can see in just the portion of the HTTPRouteGroup below. There are two `matches`

for the allowed source service.

```
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


There is a `match`

named `books-bought`

that allows the source to access path `/books-bought`

using a `GET`

method with host header user-agent and client-app information, and a `buy-a-book`

match that uses a regex express for a path containing `.*a-book.*new`

using a `GET`

method.

We can define these OSM HTTPRouteGroup configurations in the rules section of the Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

shown below:

```
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "bookstore"
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
- source:
namespaces: ["bookbuyer"]
to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
paths: ["*/books-bought", "*/buy-a-book/new"]
- when:
- key: request.headers[User-Agent]
values: ["*-http-client/*"]
- key: request.headers[Client-App]
values: ["bookbuyer"]
```


We can now deploy the OSM migrated traffic-access-v1.yaml manifest as understood by Istio below. There is not an `AuthorizationPolicy`

for the bookthief, so the bookthief UI should stop incrementing books from bookstore v1:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

```


### Allowing the Bookthief Application to access Bookstore

Currently there is no `AuthorizationPolicy`

that allows for the bookthief to communicate with bookstore. We can deploy the following `AuthorizationPolicy`

to allow the bookthief to communicate to the bookstore. You notice the addition for the rule for the bookstore policy that allows the bookthief authorization.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

```


The bookthief UI should now be incrementing books from bookstore v1.

## Configure Traffic Shifting between two Service Versions

To demonstrate how to balance traffic between two versions of a Kubernetes service, known as traffic shifting in Istio. As you recall in a previous section, OSM implementation of traffic shifting relied on two distinct services being deployed and adding those service names to the backend configuration of the `TrafficTarget`

policy. This deployment architecture is not needed for how Istio implements traffic shifting. With Istio, we can create multiple deployments that represent each version of the service application and shift traffic to those specific versions via the Istio `virtualservice`

configuration.

The currently deployed `virtualservice`

only has a route rule to the v1 version of the bookstore shown below:

```
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
```


We update the `virtualservice`

to shift 100% of the weight to the v2 version of the bookstore.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookstore-virtualservice
namespace: bookstore
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
weight: 0
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v2
weight: 100
EOF
```


You should now see both the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI incrementing for the `bookstore`

v2 service only. You can continue to experiment by changing the `weigth`

attribute to shift traffic between the two `bookstore`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

If you want to create a NAP-enabled AKS cluster with a custom virtual network (VNet) and subnets, see [Create a node auto-provisioning (NAP) cluster in a custom virtual network](node-auto-provisioning-custom-vnet).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the [Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning) article, which details [how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work), [prerequisites](node-auto-provisioning#prerequisites) and [limitations](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features).

## Enable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

The following sections explain how to enable NAP on a new or existing AKS cluster:

Note

You can enable [control plane metrics](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from [node auto-provisioning](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).

### Enable NAP on a new cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

. The following command also sets the`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Create a file named

`nap.json`

and add the following ARM template configuration with the`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field set to`Auto`

, which enables NAP. (The default setting is`Manual`

.)`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Auto" } } } ] }`

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az deployment group create`

`--template-file`

flag set to the path of the ARM template file.`az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --template-file ./nap.json`


### Enable NAP on an existing cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --node-provisioning-mode Auto`


## Disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

Important

You can only disable NAP on a cluster if the following conditions are met:

- There are no existing NAP nodes. You can use the
`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command to check for existing NAP-managed nodes. - All existing Karpenter
have their`NodePools`

`spec.limits.cpu`

field set to`0`

. This action prevents new nodes from being created, but doesn't disrupt currently running nodes.

Set the

`spec.limits.cpu`

field to`0`

for every existing Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: limits: cpu: 0`

Important

If you don't want to ensure that every pod previously running on a NAP node is safely migrated to a non-NAP node before disabling NAP, you can skip steps 2 and 3 and instead use the

`kubectl delete node`

command for each NAP-managed node. However,**we don't recommend skipping these steps**, as it might leave some pods pending and doesn't honor Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs).When using the

`kubectl delete node`

command, be careful to only delete NAP-managed nodes. You can identify NAP-managed nodes using the`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command.Add the

`karpenter.azure.com/disable:NoSchedule`

taint to every Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: template: spec: ... taints: - key: karpenter.azure.com/disable effect: NoSchedule`

This action starts the process of migrating the workloads on the NAP-managed nodes to non-NAP nodes, honoring PDBs and disruption limits. Pods migrate to non-NAP nodes if they can fit. If there isn't enough fixed-size capacity, some node NAP-managed nodes remain.

Scale up existing fixed-size

`ManagedCluster`

`AgentPools`

or create new fixed-size`AgentPools`

to take the load from the node NAP-managed nodes. As these nodes are added to the cluster, the node NAP-managed nodes are drained, and work is migrated to the fixed-size nodes.Delete all NAP-managed nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command. If NAP-managed nodes still exist, the cluster likely lacks fixed-size capacity. In this case, you should add more nodes so the remaining workloads can be migrated.

Update the NAP mode to

`Manual`

using theAzure CLI command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Manual`

.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Manual`


Update the

`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field to`Manual`

in your ARM template and redeploy it.`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Manual" } } } ] }`

# IP address planning for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides guidance on IP address planning for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

For specific guidance on IP address planning for individual CNI options, see the [next steps](#next-steps) section for links to plugin documentation.

## Subnet sizing

Your Azure VNet subnet must be large enough to accommodate your cluster, which depends on whether you're using an [overlay network](#overlay-networks) or a [flat network](#flat-networks).

### Overlay networks

With overlay networks, like [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay), your subnet needs to be large enough to assign IPs to your nodes. Pods are assigned IPs from a separate, private CIDR range and won't require VNet IPs. The VNet subnet you use for your cluster can be smaller than with flat networks.

It's important to ensure you allocate enough space in your private CIDR range for your pods to account for scaling. When planning your IP address range sizes, you should calculate your maximum pod count. Each node in your cluster is assigned a /24 (256 IP addresses) subnet for pods. You should plan your overlay network subnet to accommodate the maximum number of nodes you expect to run.

### Flat networks

Flat networks, like [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), require a large enough subnet to accommodate both nodes *and* pods. Since nodes and pods receive IPs from your VNet, you need to plan for the maximum number of nodes and pods you expect to run. Azure CNI Pod Subnet uses a subnet for your nodes and a separate subnet for your pods, so you need to plan for both.

## IP address sizing

### Upgrading and scaling considerations

When IP address planning for your AKS cluster, you should **consider the number of IP addresses required for upgrade and scaling operations**. If you set the IP address range to only support a fixed number of nodes, you won't be able to upgrade or scale your cluster.

When you **upgrade** your AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node, and an older node is removed from the cluster. This rolling upgrade process requires a minimum of one additional block of IP addresses to be available. Your node count is then `n + 1`

where `n`

is the number of nodes in your cluster.

When you **scale** an AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node. Your IP address range needs to take into considerations how you want to scale up the number of nodes and pods your cluster can support. A minimum of one additional node for upgrade operations or the number of nodes set by the [Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) option should also be included. Your node count is then `n + number-of-additional-scaled-nodes-you-anticipate + max surge`

.

If you're using [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) and you expect your nodes to run the maximum number of pods and you regularly destroy and deploy pods, you should also factor in extra IP addresses per node. There can be few seconds latency required to delete a service and release its IP address for a new service to be deployed and acquire the address. The extra IP addresses account for this possibility.

The IP address plan for an AKS cluster consists of a virtual network, at least one subnet for nodes and pods, and a Kubernetes service address range.

| Azure Resource | Address Range | Limits and Sizing |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Virtual Network | Max size /8. 65,536 configured IP address limit. See
|

Use the following equation to calculate the minimum subnet size, including an extra node for upgrade operations: `(number of nodes + max surge nodes) + ((number of nodes + max surge nodes) * maximum pods per node that you configure)`


Example for a 50-node cluster: `(51) + (51 * 30 (default)) = 1,581`

(/21 or larger)

Example for a 50-node cluster, preparing to scale up an extra 10 nodes with the default max surge of 1 node: `(61) + (61 * 30 (default)) = 1,891`

(/21 or larger)

If you don't specify a maximum number of pods per node when you create your cluster, the maximum number of pods per node is set to 30. The minimum number of IP addresses required is based on that value. If you calculate your minimum IP address requirements on a different maximum value, see [Maximum pods per node](#maximum-pods-per-node) to set this value when you deploy your cluster.

*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*address.## Maximum pods per node

The maximum number of pods per node in an AKS cluster is 250. The *default* maximum number of pods per node varies between *kubenet* and *Azure CNI* networking, and the method of cluster deployment.

| CNI | Default max pods | Configurable at deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | 250 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI Pod subnet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI (Legacy) | 30 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Kubenet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |

## Configuring maximum pods per node for your clusters

You can configure the maximum number of pods per node either at cluster deployment time or as you add new node pools. You can set the maximum pods per node value as high as 250.

A minimum value for maximum pods per node is enforced to guarantee space for system pods critical to cluster health. The minimum value that can be set for maximum pods per node is 10 if and only if the configuration of each node pool has space for a minimum of 30 pods. For example, setting the maximum pods per node to the minimum of 10 requires each individual node pool to have a minimum of three nodes. This requirement applies for each new node pool created as well, so if 10 is defined as maximum pods per node each subsequent node pool added must have at least three nodes.

| Networking | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI | 10 | 250 |
| Kubenet | 10 | 250 |

Note

The minimum value in the previous table is strictly enforced by the AKS service. You cannot set a value for *maxPods* that is lower than the minimum shown, as doing so can prevent the cluster from starting.

### New clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new cluster using one of the following methods:

**Azure CLI**: Specify the`--max-pods`

argument when you deploy a cluster with thecommand.`az aks create`

**Azure Resource Manager template**: Specify the`maxPods`

property in the [ManagedClusterAgentPoolProfile] object when you deploy a cluster with an Azure Resource Manager template.**Azure portal**: Change the`Max pods per node`

field in the node pool settings when creating a cluster or adding a new node pool.

### Existing clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new node pool. If you need to increase the *maxPods* setting on an existing cluster, add a new node pool with the new desired *maxPods* count. After migrating your pods to the new pool, delete the node older pool.

# Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID in AKS

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using a Microsoft Entra authentication token. Once authenticated, you can use the built-in Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to namespaces and cluster resources based on a user's identity or group membership.

This article shows you how to:

Control access using Kubernetes RBAC in an AKS cluster based on Microsoft Entra group membership.

Create example groups and users in Microsoft Entra ID.

Create Roles and RoleBindings in an AKS cluster granting the appropriate permissions, such as to create and view resources.


## Prerequisites

You have an existing AKS cluster with Microsoft Entra integration enabled. If you need an AKS cluster with this configuration, see

[Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](managed-azure-ad).Kubernetes RBAC is enabled by default during AKS cluster creation. To upgrade an existing cluster with Microsoft Entra integration and Kubernetes RBAC, see

[Enable Microsoft Entra integration on your existing AKS cluster](managed-azure-ad#use-an-existing-cluster).Make sure that Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later is installed and configured. To find the version, run

`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).If using Terraform, install

[Terraform](/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/overview)version 2.99.0 or later.

Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to verify Microsoft Entra integration with Kubernetes RBAC is enabled.

To verify using the Azure portal:

- Sign-in to the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)and navigate to your AKS cluster resource. - In the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Security configuration**. - Under the
**Authentication and Authorization**section, verify the**Microsoft Entra authentication with Kubernetes RBAC**option is selected.

## Create groups in Microsoft Entra ID

This section teaches you how to create two user roles to show how Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID control access cluster resources. The following two example roles are:

**Application developer**- A user named
*aksdev*that's part of the*appdev*group.

- A user named
**Site reliability engineer**(SRE)- A user named
*akssre*that's part of the*opssre*group.

- A user named

In production environments, you can use existing users and groups within a Microsoft Entra tenant.

First, get the resource ID of your AKS cluster using the

command. Then, assign the resource ID to a variable named`az aks show`

*AKS_ID*so it can be referenced in other commands.`AKS_ID=$(az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query id -o tsv)`

Create the first example group in Microsoft Entra ID for the application developers using the

command. The following example creates a group named`az ad group create`

*appdev*:`APPDEV_ID=$(az ad group create --display-name appdev --mail-nickname appdev --query id -o tsv)`

Create an Azure role assignment for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This assignment lets any member of the group use`az role assignment create`

`kubectl`

to interact with an AKS cluster by granting them the*Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User*Role.`az role assignment create \ --assignee $APPDEV_ID \ --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \ --scope $AKS_ID`

Tip

If you receive an error such as

`Principal 35bfec9328bd4d8d9b54dea6dac57b82 doesn't exist in the directory a5443dcd-cd0e-494d-a387-3039b419f0d5.`

, wait a few seconds for the Microsoft Entra group object ID to propagate through the directory then try the`az role assignment create`

command again.

## Create users in Microsoft Entra ID

After you create the example Microsoft Entra ID groups for application developers and SREs, the next step is to create two corresponding user accounts. These users are used to sign in to the AKS cluster and validate the Kubernetes RBAC integration described later in this article.

Before you begin, you must set the user principal name (UPN) and password for the application developers. The UPN must include the verified domain name of your tenant. For example, an application developer user, `aksdev@contoso.com`

. In order to figure out (or set) the verified domain names in your tenant, see [Managing custom domain names in your Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/entra/identity/users/domains-manage).

The following command prompts you for the UPN and sets it to *AAD_DEV_UPN* so it can be used in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the UPN for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_UPN
```


The following command prompts you for the password and sets it to *AAD_DEV_PW* for use in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the secure password for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_PW
```


### Create user accounts

Create the first user account in Microsoft Entra ID using the

command. The following example creates a user with the display name`az ad user create`

*AKS Dev*, the UPN, and secure password using the values in*AAD_DEV_UPN*and*AAD_DEV_PW*:`AKSDEV_ID=$(az ad user create \ --display-name "AKS Dev" \ --user-principal-name $AAD_DEV_UPN \ --password $AAD_DEV_PW \ --query id -o tsv)`

Add the user to the

*appdev*group created in the previous section using thecommand:`az ad group member add`

`az ad group member add --group appdev --member-id $AKSDEV_ID`


## Create AKS cluster resources

We have our Microsoft Entra groups, users, and Azure role assignments created. Now, you configure the AKS cluster to allow these different groups access to specific resources.

Get the cluster admin credentials using the

command. In one of the following sections, you get the regular`az aks get-credentials`

*user*cluster credentials to see the Microsoft Entra authentication flow in action.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin`

Create a namespace in the AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a namespace name`kubectl create namespace`

*dev*:`kubectl create namespace dev`

Note

In Kubernetes,

*Roles*define the permissions to grant, and*RoleBindings*apply them to desired users or groups. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster. For more information, see[Using Kubernetes RBAC authorization](concepts-identity#kubernetes-rbac).If the user you grant the Kubernetes RBAC binding for is in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, assign permissions based on the

**UPN**. If the user is in a different Microsoft Entra tenant, query for and use the*objectId*property instead.Create a Role for the

*dev*namespace, which grants full permissions to the namespace. In production environments, you can specify more granular permissions for different users or groups. Create a file named`role-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:`kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-full-access namespace: dev rules: - apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"] resources: ["*"] verbs: ["*"] - apiGroups: ["batch"] resources: - jobs - cronjobs verbs: ["*"]`

Create the Role using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f role-dev-namespace.yaml`

Get the resource ID for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This group is set as the subject of a RoleBinding in the next step.`az ad group show`

`az ad group show --group appdev --query id -o tsv`

Create a RoleBinding for the

*appdev*group to use the previously created Role for namespace access. Create a file named`rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest. On the last line, replace*groupObjectId*with the group object ID output from the previous command.`kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-access namespace: dev roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: dev-user-full-access subjects: - kind: Group namespace: dev name: groupObjectId`

Tip

If you want to create the RoleBinding for a single user, specify

*kind: User*and replace*groupObjectId*with the UPN in the previous sample.Create the RoleBinding using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`


## Access AKS cluster resources with Microsoft Entra identities

Now, test that the expected permissions work when you create and manage resources in an AKS cluster. In these examples, you schedule and view pods in the user's assigned namespace, and try to schedule and view pods outside of the assigned namespace.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand. In a previous section, you set the context using the cluster admin credentials. The admin user bypasses Microsoft Entra sign-in prompts. Without the`az aks get-credentials`

`--admin`

parameter, the user context is applied that requires all requests to be authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule a basic NGINX pod using the

command in the`kubectl run`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

Enter the credentials for the

*appdev*group account (enter*your*own credentials) at the sign-in prompt. Once you're successfully signed in, the account token is cached for future`kubectl`

commands. The NGINX is successfully scheduled as shown in the following example output:`$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code B24ZD6FP8 to authenticate. pod/nginx-dev created`

Use the

command to view pods in the`kubectl get pods`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl get pods --namespace dev`

Ensure the status of the NGINX pod is

*Running*. The output looks like the following output:`$ kubectl get pods --namespace dev NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-dev 1/1 Running 0 4m`


### Test SRE access to AKS cluster resources

To confirm that our Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC work correctly between different users and groups, try the previous commands when signed in as the *akssre* user.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand that clears the previously cached authentication token for the`az aks get-credentials`

*aksdev*user.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule and view pods in the assigned

*SRE*namespace. When prompted, sign in with the*opssre*group account credentials (enter*your*own credentials).`kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre kubectl get pods --namespace sre`

As shown in the following example output, you can successfully create and view the pods:

`$ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre`

To sign in, use a web browser to open the page

[https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin)and enter the code BM4RHP3FD to authenticate.`pod/nginx-sre created $ kubectl get pods --namespace sre NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-sre 1/1 Running 0`

Try to view or schedule pods outside of assigned SRE namespace.

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

These

`kubectl`

commands fail, as shown in the following example output. The user's group membership and Kubernetes Role and RoleBindings don't grant permissions to create or manager resources in other namespaces.`$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot list pods at the cluster scope $ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create pods in the namespace "dev"`


### Create and view cluster resources outside of the assigned namespace

To view pods outside of the *dev* namespace. Use the [ kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command using

`--all-namespaces`

:```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```


The user's group membership doesn't have a Kubernetes Role that allows this action, as shown in the following example output:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "aksdev@contoso.com" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```


In the same way, schedule a pod in a different namespace, such as the *SRE* namespace. The user's group membership doesn't align with a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding to grant these permissions, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "sre"
```


### Clean up cluster resources

To clean up all of the resources, run the following commands:

```
# Get the admin kubeconfig context to delete the necessary cluster resources.
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
# Delete the dev and SRE namespaces. This also deletes the pods, Roles, and RoleBindings.
kubectl delete namespace dev
kubectl delete namespace sre
# Delete the Azure AD user accounts for aksdev and akssre.
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSDEV_ID
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSSRE_ID
# Delete the Azure AD groups for appdev and opssre. This also deletes the Azure role assignments.
az ad group delete --group appdev
az ad group delete --group opssre
```

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Background

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network. This network can either be customized and preconfigured by you or it can be created and managed by AKS. In either case, the cluster has **outbound**, or egress, dependencies on services outside of the virtual network.

For management and operational purposes, nodes in an AKS cluster need to access certain ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). These endpoints are required for the nodes to communicate with the API server or to download and install core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates. For example, the cluster needs to pull container images from Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR).

The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means you can't use network security groups (NSGs) to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound internet access. This level of network access allows nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. For outbound internet traffic, it's not recommended to set all deny rules in an NSG.

A [network isolated AKS cluster](concepts-network-isolated), provides the simplest and most secure solution for setting up outbound restrictions for a cluster out of the box. A network isolated cluster pulls the images for cluster components and add-ons from a private Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance connected to the cluster instead of pulling from MAR. If the images aren't present, the private ACR pulls them from MAR and serves them via its private endpoint, eliminating the need to enable egress from the cluster to the public MAR endpoint. The cluster operator can then incrementally set up allowed outbound traffic securely over a private network for each scenario they want to enable. This way the cluster operators have complete control over designing the allowed outbound traffic from their clusters right from the start, thus allowing them to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.

Another solution to securing outbound addresses is using a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination. You can also configure your preferred firewall and security rules to allow these required ports and addresses.

Important

This document covers only how to lock down the traffic leaving the AKS subnet. AKS has no ingress requirements by default. Blocking **internal subnet traffic** using network security groups (NSGs) and firewalls isn't supported. To control and block the traffic within the cluster, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).

## Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters

The following network and FQDN/application rules are required for an AKS cluster. You can use them if you wish to configure a solution other than Azure Firewall.

- IP address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic).
- FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
- Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your AKS cluster based on a number of qualifiers.
- AKS uses an admission controller to inject the FQDN as an environment variable to all deployments under kube-system and gatekeeper-system. This ensures all system communication between nodes and API server uses the API server FQDN and not the API server IP. You can get the same behavior on your own pods, in any namespace, by annotating the pod spec with an annotation named
`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

. If that annotation is present, AKS will set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This is useful in cases where the cluster egress is via a layer 7 firewall. - If you have an app or solution that needs to talk to the API server, you must either add an
**additional**network rule to allow**TCP communication to port 443 of your API server's IP****OR**, if you have a layer 7 firewall configured to allow traffic to the API Server's domain name, set`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

in your pod specs. - On rare occasions, if there's a maintenance operation, your API server IP might change. Planned maintenance operations that can change the API server IP are always communicated in advance.
- You might notice traffic towards "md-*.blob.storage.azure.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used for internal components of Azure Managed Disks. Blocking access to this endpoint from your firewall should not cause any issues.
- You might notice traffic towards "umsa*.blob.core.windows.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used to store manifests for Azure Linux VM Agent & Extensions and is regularly checked to download new versions. You can find more details on
[VM Extensions](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/features-linux?tabs=azure-cli#network-access).

MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, aiming to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes training, packaging, validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models.

MLOps requires multiple roles and tools to work together effectively. Data scientists focus on tasks related to training the model, which is referred to as the * inner loop*. Machine learning engineers and IT operations teams handle the

*, where they apply DevOps practices to package, validate, deploy, and monitor models. When the model needs fine-tuning or retraining, the process loops back to the inner loop.*

**outer loop**### MLOps pipeline

Your MLOps pipeline may leverage various tools and microservices that are deployed sequentially or in parallel. Below are examples of key components in your pipeline that benefit from implementing the following best practices to reduce overhead and allow for faster iteration:

- Unstructured data store for new data flowing into your application
- Vector database to store and query structured, pre-processed data
- Data ingestion and indexing framework
- Vector ingestion and/or model retraining workflows
- Metrics collection and alerting tools (tracking model performance, volume of ingested data, etc.)
- Lifecycle management tools

## DevOps and MLOps

DevOps is a combination of tools and practices that enable you to create robust and reproducible applications. The goal of using DevOps is to quickly deliver value to your end users. Creating, deploying, and monitoring robust and reproducible models to deliver value to end users is the primary goal of MLOps.

There are *three* processes that are essential to MLOps:

**Machine learning workloads**for which a data scientist is responsible, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training and tuning.**Software development practices**including planning, developing, testing, and packaging the model for deployment.**Operational aspects of deploying and maintaining the model in production**, including releasing, configuring resources, and monitoring the model.

### DevOps principles that apply to MLOps

MLOps leverages several principles from DevOps to enhance the machine learning lifecycle, such as *automation*, *continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)*, *source control*, *Agile planning*, and *infrastructure as code (IaC)*.

#### Automation

By automating tasks, you can reduce manual errors, increase efficiency, and ensure consistency across the ML lifecycle. Automation can be applied to various stages, including data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Through automation, you can also apply proactive measures in the AI pipeline to ensure data compliance with your organization's policies.

For example, your pipeline can automate:

- Model tuning/retraining at regular time intervals or when a certain amount of new data is collected in your application.
- Detection of performance degradation to kickstart fine-tuning or retraining on a different subset of data.
- Common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) scanning on base container images pulled from external container registries to ensure safe security practices.

#### Continuous integration (CI)

Continuous integration covers the *creating* and *verifying* aspects of the model development process. The goal of CI is to create the code and to verify the quality of the code and the model before deployment. This includes testing on a range of sample data sets to ensure that the model performs as expected and meets quality standards.

In MLOps, CI might involve:

- Refactoring exploratory code in Jupyter notebooks into Python or R scripts.
- Validating new input data for missing or error values.
- Unit testing and integration testing in the end-to-end pipeline.

To perform linting and unit testing, you can use automation tools like Azure Pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

#### Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery involves the steps needed to safely deploy a model in production. The first step is to package and deploy the model in *pre-production environments*, such as dev and test environments. Portability of the parameters, hyperparameters, and other model artifacts is an important aspect to maintain as you promote the code through these environments. This portability is especially important when it comes to large language models (LLMs) and stable diffusion models. Once the model passes the unit tests and quality assurance (QA) tests, you can approve it for deployment in the *production environment*.

#### Source control

Source control, or *version control*, is essential for managing changes to code and models. In an ML system, this refers to data versioning, code versioning, and model versioning, which allow cross-functional teams to collaborate effectively and track changes over time. Using a Git-based source control system, like [ Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/repos/#:%7E:text=Overview.%20Free%20private%20Git%20repositories,%20pull%20requests,%20and?msockid=182ea2d5e1ff6eb61ccbb1b8e5ff608a) in Azure DevOps or a

**GitHub repository**, enables you to programmatically maintain a history of changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches for different experiments.

#### Agile planning

Agile planning involves isolating work into *sprints*, which are short time frames for completing specific tasks. This approach allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements to the model. Model training can be an ongoing process, and Agile planning can help scope the project and enable better team alignment.

You can use tools like [ Azure Boards](/en-us/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards) in Azure DevOps or

**GitHub issues**to manage your Agile planning.

#### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

You use infrastructure as code to repeat and automate the infrastructure needed to train, deploy, and serve your models. In an ML system, IaC helps simplify and define the appropriate Azure resources needed for the specific job type in code, and the code is maintained in a repository. This allows you to version control your infrastructure and make changes for resource optimization, cost-effectiveness, etc. as needed.

# Create a fully managed GPU node pool on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you run GPU workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to install and maintain several software components, including the GPU driver, Kubernetes device plugin, and GPU metrics exporter for telemetry. These components are essential for enabling GPU scheduling, container-level GPU access, observability of resource usage, and proper functioning of AKS GPU-enabled nodes. Previously, cluster operators had to either install these components manually or use open-source alternatives like the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](nvidia-gpu-operator), which can introduce complexity and operational overhead.

AKS now supports fully managed GPU nodes (preview) and installs the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and Data Center GPU Manager [(DCGM) metrics exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/tree/main) by default. This feature enables one-step GPU node pool creation and makes the availability of GPU resources in AKS as simple as general purpose CPU nodes.

In this article, you learn how to provision a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) in your AKS cluster, including default installation of the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and metrics exporter.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.72.2 or later installed. To find the version, run
`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need to
[install and upgrade to latest version of the](#install-the-aks-preview-cli-extension).`aks-preview`

extension - You need to
[register the](#register-the-managedgpuexperiencepreview-feature-flag-in-your-subscription).`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

## Limitations

- This feature currently supports
[NVIDIA GPU-enabled virtual machine (VM) sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu)only. - Updating a general-purpose node pool to add a GPU VM size isn't supported on AKS.
- Windows node pools are not supported with this feature, because GPU metrics are not supported. When creating Windows GPU node pools, AKS automatically installs and manages the drivers and Directx device plugin. See
[AKS Windows GPU documentation](use-windows-gpu)for more information. - Migrating your existing
[multi-instance GPU](gpu-multi-instance)node pools to use this feature isn't supported. - In-place upgrades to use this feature on existing GPU-enabled nodes isn't supported.

Note

GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) tool and [region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

### Install the `aks-preview`

CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to ensure you have the latest version installed using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

Register the

`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS-managed GPU node pool (preview)

You can add a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) to an existing AKS cluster by specifying OS SKU and `--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command. When you do this, AKS will install the GPU driver, GPU device plugin, and metrics exporter automatically.

To use the default Ubuntu operating system (OS) SKU, you create the node pool without specifying an OS SKU. The node pool is configured for the default operating system based on the Kubernetes version of the cluster.

Add a node pool to your cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource‐group MyResourceGroup \ --cluster‐name MyAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \ --node‐count 1 \ --node‐vm‐size Standard_NC6s_v3 \ --node‐taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \ --enable‐cluster‐autoscaler \ --min‐count 1 \ --max‐count 3 \ --tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

Confirm that the managed NVIDIA GPU software components are installed successfully:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \`

Your output should include the following values:

`... ... "gpuInstanceProfile": … "gpuProfile": { "driver": "Install" }, ... ...`


## Migrate existing GPU workloads to an AKS-managed GPU node pool

In-place upgrades from a standard NVIDIA GPU node pool to a fully managed NVIDIA GPU node pool (preview) on your AKS cluster isn't supported. We recommend cordoning and draining your existing GPU nodes, then redeploying your workloads to a new GPU-enabled node pool with this feature enabled. See [Resize node pools on AKS](resize-node-pool) to learn more.

## Bring your own (BYO) GPU driver

If you want to control the installation of the NVIDIA drivers or use the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html), you can bypass the GPU driver installation during node pool creation. In this case, Microsoft **doesn't support or manage** the maintenance and compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment. See [Skip GPU driver installation](use-nvidia-gpu#skip-gpu-driver-installation) for NVIDIA GPU-enabled nodes on AKS to learn more.

## Next steps

- Deploy a
[sample GPU workload](use-nvidia-gpu#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload)on your AKS-managed GPU-enabled nodes. - Learn about
[GPU utilization and performance metrics](monitor-gpu-metrics)from managed NVIDIA DCGM exporter on your GPU node pool.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes OS versions available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes, and best practices for testing and upgrading your OS version.

Caution

In this article, there are references to Ubuntu and Azure Linux OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS:

- Starting on
**March 17, 2027**, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by[upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to Kubernetes version 1.34+. For more information on this retirement, see[Retirement: Ubuntu 20.04 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874). - As of
**November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the[202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning**March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by[upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster)to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to[osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see[[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported OS versions

Each [node image](node-images) corresponds to an OS version, which you can specify using OS SKU. You can specify the following parameters when creating clusters and node pools:

**--os-type**: OS type, including Linux or Windows.*You can't specify the Windows OS type during cluster creation or update.***--os-sku**: Used to specify OS version or OS variant.*You can't specify the Windows OS SKU during cluster creation or update.*For more information for supported OS SKU options, see[Azure AKS CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)or[API](/en-us/rest/api/aks/agent-pools/create-or-update#ossku).**--kubernetes-version**: Version of Kubernetes to use for creating the node pool or cluster.


Best practice guidanceThe default OS version is the most recent validated version.


- For Ubuntu, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku Ubuntu`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Ubuntu version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Azure Linux, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku AzureLinux`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Azure Linux version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Windows, we recommend creating node pools while specifying
`--os-type Windows`

and`--os-sku Windows2022`

. You need to manually update node pools to the next OS version when it's released.

| OS type | OS SKU | Supported Kubernetes versions | Default versioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2404 | This OS SKU will only be supported in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.38. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you want to migrate to the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 24.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2204 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.36. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you need to roll back to Ubuntu 22.04. Ubuntu 22.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35. |
| Linux | AzureLinux | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Azure Linux 2.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.27 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.32+. When the `AzureLinuxV3Preview` feature flag is enabled on AKS 1.31, `--os-sku AzureLinux` defaults to 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinux3 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes 1.28 to 1.36. | We recommend this OS SKU if you want to test out the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You can also use this OS SKU to migrate from Azure Linux 2.0 to Azure Linux 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinuxOSGuard | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 and above. | Azure Linux with OS Guard versions are upgraded through node image upgrades. For more information, see
|

[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).## Migrate to a new OS version

When a new OS version releases on AKS, it's initially supported in preview. After testing in preview for a few months, AKS makes the new OS version generally available (GA) and then updates the default OS SKU (`Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

) to the latest GA OS version. This default update occurs with a new Kubernetes version release.

We recommend testing your nonproduction workloads with the new OS version when it becomes available in preview. In order to access preview functions, make sure you have the preview extension installed. You can install the extension using the `az extension add --name aks-preview`

command.

There are two ways to migrate to a new OS version:

**Default OS SKU**: If you're using a default OS SKU such as`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

, you automatically get the latest GA version when you[upgrade your Kubernetes version](manage-node-pools). There are no manual changes required to migrate to a new OS version.**Versioned OS SKU**: If you're using a versioned OS SKU such as`Ubuntu2404`

,`AzureLinux3`

, or`Windows2025`

, you need to manually migrate to a new OS version to avoid blocked Kubernetes upgrades. If you're using a Linux OS, you can update the OS SKU on an existing node pool to manually migrate.

### Update OS SKU on an existing node pool

Update the `os-sku`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command. In cases where there's a new OS version available in preview, this functionality allows you to migrate your node pool to the new OS version without needing to upgrade your Kubernetes version.

Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Migrate to Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for `--os-sku Ubuntu`

in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. You can also use Ubuntu 24.04 by specifying `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)is not supported.- Ubuntu 24.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.38.
- You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.39+.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

is an option and is intended for testing the new OS Linux version without requiring you to upgrade your Kubernetes version. - You need the preview Azure CLI version 18.0.0b5 or later for
*preview*and version 2.82.0 for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2404 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


#### Migrate to Azure Linux 3.0

Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for `--os-sku AzureLinux`

in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.36. You can also use Azure Linux 3.0 by specifying `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

:

`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.28 to 1.36.`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is intended for migrating to Azure Linux 3.0 without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.37+.- You need the Azure CLI version 18.0.0b36 or later for
*preview*and version 2.78.0 or later for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux3 \
--kubernetes-version 1.30.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


## Roll back your OS version

In Kubernetes versions where multiple OS versions are supported, you can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to roll back to a previous OS version.

You might want to roll back your OS version in the following scenarios:

- If you're testing a new OS version and you run into any issues.
- Once you upgrade to a Kubernetes version that supports the new OS version as default, you might want to roll back to the default
`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

OS SKU. This allows you to get future OS versions as a part of your Kubernetes upgrades instead of requiring a node pool update.

### Roll back your OS version to the default OS SKU

You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to update the

`os-sku`

on an existing node pool. In cases where there's a previous OS version supported in your Kubernetes version, this functionality can allow you to roll back your OS version.Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

| OS SKU | Default OS version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | When you have OS SKU `Ubuntu` , Ubuntu 22.04 is the default OS version if your Kubernetes version is 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for Ubuntu in Kubernetes 1.35 to 1.37. |
| AzureLinux | When you have OS SKU `AzureLinux` , Azure Linux 2.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.26 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.36. |

#### Update your OS SKU to Ubuntu on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `Ubuntu`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Update your OS SKU to Azure Linux on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `AzureLinux`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


### Roll back to Ubuntu 22.04

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[CVM](use-cvm)aren't supported.- Ubuntu 22.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

is intended for roll back to Ubuntu 22.04 on your current Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option to upgrade your Kubernetes version to 1.36 and above.

Roll back to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2204 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```
