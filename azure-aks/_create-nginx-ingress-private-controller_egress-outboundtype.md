Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to configure an NGINX ingress controller to work with an Azure internal load balancer. It also explains how to configure a private Azure DNS zone to enable DNS resolution for the private endpoints to resolve specific domains.

## Before you begin

An AKS cluster with the

[application routing add-on](app-routing).To attach an Azure private DNS Zone, you need the

[Owner](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner),[Azure account administrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles), or[Azure coadministrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles)role on your Azure subscription.

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use `kubectl`

, the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl`

is already installed.

The following example configures connecting to your cluster named *aks-cluster* in the *test-rg* using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name aks-cluster
```


## Create a virtual network

To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, specify a list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone with [virtual network links](/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links).

The following example creates a virtual network named *vnet-1* in the *test-rg* resource group, and one subnet named *subnet-1* to create within the virtual network with a specific address prefix.

```
az network vnet create \
--name vnet-1 \
--resource-group test-rg \
--location eastus \
--address-prefix 10.2.0.0/16 \
--subnet-name subnet-1 \
--subnet-prefixes 10.2.0.0/24
```


## Create an Azure private DNS zone

Note

You can configure the application routing add-on to automatically create records on one or more Azure global and private DNS zones for hosts defined on ingress resources. All global Azure DNS zones and all private Azure DNS zones must be in the same resource group.

Create a DNS zone using the [az network private-dns zone create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/zone?#az-network-private-dns-zone-create) command, specifying the name of the zone and the resource group to create it in. The following example creates a DNS zone named *private.contoso.com* in the *test-rg* resource group.

```
az network private-dns zone create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name private.contoso.com
```


You create a virtual network link to the DNS zone created earlier using the [az network private-dns link vnet create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/link/vnet#az-network-private-dns-link-vnet-create) command. The following example creates a link named *dns-link* to the zone *private.contoso.com* for the virtual network *vnet-1*. Include the `--registration-enabled`

parameter to specify the link isn't registration enabled.

```
az network private-dns link vnet create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name dns-link \
--zone-name private.contoso.com \
--virtual-network vnet-1 \
--registration-enabled false
```


The Azure DNS private zone auto registration feature manages DNS records for virtual machines deployed in a virtual network. When you link a virtual network with a private DNS zone with this setting enabled, a DNS record gets created for each Azure virtual machine for your AKS node deployed in the virtual network.

## Attach an Azure private DNS zone to the application routing add-on

Note

The `az aks approuting zone add`

command uses the permissions of the user running the command to create the [Azure DNS Zone](/en-us/azure/dns/dns-protect-private-zones-recordsets) role assignment. The **Private DNS Zone Contributor** role is a built-in role for managing private DNS resources and is assigned to the add-on's managed identity. For more information on AKS managed identities, see [Summary of managed identities](managed-identity-overview#summary-of-managed-identities-used-by-aks).

Retrieve the resource ID for the DNS zone using the

command and set the output to a variable named`az network dns zone show`

`ZONEID`

. The following example queries the zone*private.contoso.com*in the resource group*test-rg*.`ZONEID=$(az network private-dns zone show \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name private.contoso.com \ --query "id" \ --output tsv)`

Update the add-on to enable integration with Azure DNS using the

command. You can pass a comma-separated list of DNS zone resource IDs. The following example updates the AKS cluster`az aks approuting zone`

*aks-cluster*in the resource group*test-rg*.`az aks approuting zone add \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name aks-cluster \ --ids=${ZONEID} \ --attach-zones`


## Create an NGINX ingress controller with a private IP address and an internal load balancer

The application routing add-on uses a Kubernetes [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) called [ NginxIngressController](https://aka.ms/aks/approuting/nginxingresscontrollercrd) to configure NGINX ingress controllers. You can create more ingress controllers or modify an existing configuration.

`NginxIngressController`

CRD has a `loadBalancerAnnotations`

field to control the behavior of the NGINX ingress controller's service by setting load balancer annotations. For more information about load balancer annotations, see [Customizations via Kubernetes annotations](configure-load-balancer-standard#customizations-via-kubernetes-annotations).

Perform the following steps to create an NGINX ingress controller with an internal facing Azure Load Balancer with a private IP address.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**nginx-internal-controller.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-internal spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal controllerNamePrefix: nginx-internal loadBalancerAnnotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-internal-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-internal created`

Verify the ingress controller was created

You can verify the status of the NGINX ingress controller using the

command.`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

The following example output shows the created resource. It might take a few minutes for the controller to be available:

`NAME INGRESSCLASS CONTROLLERNAMEPREFIX AVAILABLE default webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com nginx True nginx-internal nginx-internal nginx-internal True`


## Deploy an application

The application routing add-on uses annotations on Kubernetes Ingress objects to create the appropriate resources.

Create the application namespace called

`aks-store`

to run the example pods using the`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace aks-store`

Deploy the AKS store application using the following YAML manifest file:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/sample-manifests/docs/app-routing/aks-store-deployments-and-services.yaml -n aks-store`


This manifest creates the necessary deployments and services for the AKS store application.

## Create the Ingress resource that uses a host name on the Azure private DNS zone and a private IP address

Update ** host** with the name of your DNS host, for example,

**store-front.private.contoso.com**. Verify you're specifying nginx-internal for the ingressClassName.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**ingress.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: store-front namespace: aks-store spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal rules: - host: store-front.private.contoso.com http: paths: - backend: service: name: store-front port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix`

Create the ingress resource using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n aks-store`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`ingress.networking.k8s.io/store-front created`


## Verify the managed Ingress was created

You can verify the managed Ingress was created using the [ kubectl get ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command.

```
kubectl get ingress -n aks-store
```


The following example output shows the created managed Ingress:

```
NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
store-front nginx-internal store-front.private.contoso.com 80 10s
```


## Verify the Azure private DNS zone was updated

In a few minutes, run the [az network private-dns record-set a list](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/record-set/a#az-network-private-dns-record-set-a-list) command to view the A records for your Azure private DNS zone. Specify the name of the resource group and the name of the DNS zone. In this example, the resource group is *test-rg* and DNS zone is *private.contoso.com*.

```
az network private-dns record-set a list \
--resource-group test-rg \
--zone-name private.contoso.com
```


The following example output shows the created record:

```
[
{
"aRecords": [
{
"ipv4Address": "10.224.0.7"
}
],
"etag": "ecc303c5-4577-4ca2-b545-d34e160d1c2d",
"fqdn": "store-front.private.contoso.com.",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/private.contoso.com/A/store-front",
"isAutoRegistered": false,
"name": "store-front",
"resourceGroup": "test-rg",
"ttl": 300,
"type": "Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/A"
}
]
```

# Customize cluster egress with outbound types in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Note

After [31 March 2026](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=default-outbound-access-for-vms-in-azure-will-be-retired-transition-to-a-new-method-of-internet-access), new AKS clusters that use the **AKS-managed virtual network** option will place cluster subnets into [private subnets](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access#why-is-disabling-default-outbound-access-recommended) by default (`defaultOutboundAccess = false`

).

This setting **does not impact AKS-managed cluster traffic**, which uses explicitly configured outbound paths. It may affect **unsupported scenarios**, such as deploying other resources (e.g., VMs) into the same subnet.

**Clusters using BYO VNets are unaffected** by this change. In supported configurations, no action is required.

You can customize egress for an AKS cluster to fit specific scenarios. By default, AKS creates a Standard Load Balancer to be set up and used for egress. However, the default setup may not meet the requirements of all scenarios if public IPs are disallowed or extra hops are required for egress.

This article covers the various types of outbound connectivity that are available in AKS clusters.

Note

You can now update the `outboundType`

after cluster creation.

Important

In nonprivate clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Limitations

- Setting
`outboundType`

requires AKS clusters with a`vm-set-type`

of`VirtualMachineScaleSets`

and`load-balancer-sku`

of`Standard`

.

## Outbound types in AKS

You can configure an AKS cluster using the following outbound types: load balancer, NAT gateway, or user-defined routing. The outbound type impacts only the egress traffic of your cluster. For more information, see [setting up ingress controllers](ingress-basic).

### Outbound type of `loadBalancer`


The load balancer is used for egress through an AKS-assigned public IP. An outbound type of `loadBalancer`

supports Kubernetes services of type `loadBalancer`

, which expect egress out of the load balancer created by the AKS resource provider.

If `loadBalancer`

is set, AKS automatically completes the following configuration:

- A public IP address is created for cluster egress.
- The public IP address is assigned to the load balancer resource.
- Backend pools for the load balancer are set up for agent nodes in the cluster.

For more information, see [using a standard load balancer in AKS](load-balancer-standard).

### Outbound type of `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`


If `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`

are selected for `outboundType`

, AKS relies on [Azure Networking NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/manage-nat-gateway) for cluster egress.

- Select
`managedNatGateway`

when using managed virtual networks. AKS provisions a NAT gateway and attach it to the cluster subnet. - Select
`userAssignedNatGateway`

when using bring-your-own virtual networking. This option requires that you have a NAT gateway created before cluster creation.

For more information, see [using NAT gateway with AKS](nat-gateway).

### Outbound type of `userDefinedRouting`


Note

The `userDefinedRouting`

outbound type is an advanced networking scenario and requires proper network configuration.

If `userDefinedRouting`

is set, AKS doesn't automatically configure egress paths. The egress setup is completed by you.

You must deploy the AKS cluster into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is configured. Since you're not using a standard load balancer (SLB) architecture, you must establish explicit egress. This architecture requires explicitly sending egress traffic to an appliance like a firewall, gateway, proxy or to allow NAT to be done by a public IP assigned to the standard load balancer or appliance.

For more information, see [configuring cluster egress via user-defined routing](egress-udr).

### Outbound type of `none`


Important

The `none`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure the cluster operates as expected without unintended dependencies on external services. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `none`

is set, AKS won't automatically configure egress paths. This option is similar to `userDefinedRouting`

but does **not** require a default route as part of validation.

The `none`

outbound type is supported in both bring-your-own (BYO) virtual network scenarios and managed VNet scenarios. However, you must ensure that the AKS cluster is deployed into a network environment where explicit egress paths are defined if needed. For BYO VNet scenarios, the cluster must be deployed into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is already configured. Since AKS doesn't create a standard load balancer or any egress infrastructure, you must establish explicit egress paths if needed. Egress options can include routing traffic to a firewall, proxy, gateway, or other custom network configurations.

### Outbound type of `block`

(Preview)

Important

The `block`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure no unintended network dependencies exist. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `block`

is set, AKS configures network rules to **actively block all egress traffic** from the cluster. This option is useful for highly secure environments where outbound connectivity must be restricted.

When using `block`

:

- AKS ensures that no public internet traffic can leave the cluster through network security group (NSG) rules. VNet traffic isn't affected.
- You must explicitly allow any required egress traffic through extra network configurations.

The `block`

option provides another level of network isolation but requires careful planning to avoid breaking workloads or dependencies.

## Updating `outboundType`

after cluster creation

Changing the outbound type after cluster creation deploys or removes resources as required to put the cluster into the new egress configuration.

The following tables show the supported migration paths between outbound types for managed and BYO virtual networks.

### Supported Migration Paths for Managed VNet

Each row shows whether the outbound type can be migrated to the types listed across the top. "Supported" means migration is possible, while "Not Supported" or "N/A" means it isn't.

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported |
`block` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A |

### Supported Migration Paths for BYO VNet

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`userDefinedRouting` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A | Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | N/A | Not Supported |

Migration is only supported between `loadBalancer`

, `managedNATGateway`

(if using a managed virtual network), `userAssignedNATGateway`

and `userDefinedRouting`

(if using a custom virtual network).

Warning

Migrating the outbound type to user managed types (`userAssignedNATGateway`

or `userDefinedRouting`

) will change the outbound public IP addresses of the cluster.
if [Authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges) is enabled, ensure new outbound IP range is appended to authorized IP range.

Warning

Changing the outbound type on a cluster is disruptive to network connectivity and results in a change of the cluster's egress IP address. If any firewall rules are configured to restrict traffic from the cluster, you need to update them to match the new egress IP address.

### Update cluster to use a new outbound type

Note

You must use a version >= 2.56 of Azure CLI to migrate outbound type. Use `az upgrade`

to update to the latest version of Azure CLI.

- Update the outbound configuration of your cluster using the
command.`az aks update`


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to managedNATGateway

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type managedNATGateway --nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>
```


### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to loadbalancer

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> \
--outbound-type loadBalancer \
<--load-balancer-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>| --load-balancer-outbound-ips <outbound ip ids> | --load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes <outbound ip prefix ids> >
```


Warning

Don't reuse an IP address that is already in use in prior outbound configurations.

### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to userDefinedRouting

- Add route
`0.0.0.0/0`

default route table. Please see[Customize cluster egress with a user-defined routing table in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](egress-udr)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userDefinedRouting
```


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to userAssignedNATGateway in BYO vnet scenario

- Associate nat gateway with subnet where the workload is associated with. Refer to
[Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway](nat-gateway)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway
```
