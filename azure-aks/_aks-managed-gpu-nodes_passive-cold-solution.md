When you run GPU workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to install and maintain several software components, including the GPU driver, Kubernetes device plugin, and GPU metrics exporter for telemetry. These components are essential for enabling GPU scheduling, container-level GPU access, observability of resource usage, and proper functioning of AKS GPU-enabled nodes. Previously, cluster operators had to either install these components manually or use open-source alternatives like the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](nvidia-gpu-operator), which can introduce complexity and operational overhead.

AKS now supports fully managed GPU nodes (preview) and installs the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and Data Center GPU Manager [(DCGM) metrics exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/tree/main) by default. This feature enables one-step GPU node pool creation and makes the availability of GPU resources in AKS as simple as general purpose CPU nodes.

In this article, you learn how to provision a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) in your AKS cluster, including default installation of the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and metrics exporter.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.72.2 or later installed. To find the version, run
`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need to
[install and upgrade to latest version of the](#install-the-aks-preview-cli-extension).`aks-preview`

extension - You need to
[register the](#register-the-managedgpuexperiencepreview-feature-flag-in-your-subscription).`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

## Limitations

- This feature currently supports
[NVIDIA GPU-enabled virtual machine (VM) sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu)only. - Updating a general-purpose node pool to add a GPU VM size isn't supported on AKS.
- Windows node pools are not supported with this feature, because GPU metrics are not supported. When creating Windows GPU node pools, AKS automatically installs and manages the drivers and Directx device plugin. See
[AKS Windows GPU documentation](use-windows-gpu)for more information. - Migrating your existing
[multi-instance GPU](gpu-multi-instance)node pools to use this feature isn't supported. - In-place upgrades to use this feature on existing GPU-enabled nodes isn't supported.

Note

GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) tool and [region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

### Install the `aks-preview`

CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to ensure you have the latest version installed using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

Register the

`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS-managed GPU node pool (preview)

You can add a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) to an existing AKS cluster by specifying OS SKU and `--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command. When you do this, AKS will install the GPU driver, GPU device plugin, and metrics exporter automatically.

To use the default Ubuntu operating system (OS) SKU, you create the node pool without specifying an OS SKU. The node pool is configured for the default operating system based on the Kubernetes version of the cluster.

Add a node pool to your cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource‐group MyResourceGroup \ --cluster‐name MyAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \ --node‐count 1 \ --node‐vm‐size Standard_NC6s_v3 \ --node‐taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \ --enable‐cluster‐autoscaler \ --min‐count 1 \ --max‐count 3 \ --tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

Confirm that the managed NVIDIA GPU software components are installed successfully:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \`

Your output should include the following values:

`... ... "gpuInstanceProfile": … "gpuProfile": { "driver": "Install" }, ... ...`


## Migrate existing GPU workloads to an AKS-managed GPU node pool

In-place upgrades from a standard NVIDIA GPU node pool to a fully managed NVIDIA GPU node pool (preview) on your AKS cluster isn't supported. We recommend cordoning and draining your existing GPU nodes, then redeploying your workloads to a new GPU-enabled node pool with this feature enabled. See [Resize node pools on AKS](resize-node-pool) to learn more.

## Bring your own (BYO) GPU driver

If you want to control the installation of the NVIDIA drivers or use the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html), you can bypass the GPU driver installation during node pool creation. In this case, Microsoft **doesn't support or manage** the maintenance and compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment. See [Skip GPU driver installation](use-nvidia-gpu#skip-gpu-driver-installation) for NVIDIA GPU-enabled nodes on AKS to learn more.

## Next steps

- Deploy a
[sample GPU workload](use-nvidia-gpu#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload)on your AKS-managed GPU-enabled nodes. - Learn about
[GPU utilization and performance metrics](monitor-gpu-metrics)from managed NVIDIA DCGM exporter on your GPU node pool.

# Passive-cold solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. When the region becomes unavailable during a disaster, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

This guide outlines a passive-cold solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with only one cluster actively serving traffic when the application is needed.

Note

The following practice has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Passive-cold solution overview

In this approach, we have two independent AKS clusters being deployed in two Azure regions. When the application is needed, we activate the passive cluster to receive traffic. If the passive cluster goes down, we must manually activate the cold cluster to take over the flow of traffic. We can set this condition through a manual input every time or to specify a certain event.

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented as a “use as needed” workload, which is useful for scenarios that require workloads to run at specific times of day or run on demand. Example use cases for a passive-cold approach include:

- A manufacturing company that needs to run a complex and resource-intensive simulation on a large dataset. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a cloud region that offers high-performance computing and storage services. The passive cluster is only used when the simulation is triggered by the user or by a schedule. If the cluster doesn’t work upon triggering, the cold cluster can be used as a backup and the workload can run on it instead.
- A government agency that needs to maintain a backup of its critical systems and data in case of a cyber attack or natural disaster. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a secure and isolated location that’s not accessible to the public.

## Components

The passive-cold disaster recovery solution uses many Azure services. This example architecture involves the following components:

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. When the app is needed, the passive cluster is activated to receive network traffic.

**Key Vault**: You provision an [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in each region to store secrets and keys.

**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

**Hub-spoke pair**: A hub-spoke pair is deployed for each regional AKS instance. [Azure Firewall Manager](/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/overview) policies manage the firewall rules across each region.

**Container Registry**: The container images for the workload are stored in a managed container registry. With this solution, a single [Azure Container Registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) instance is used for all Kubernetes instances in the cluster. Geo-replication for Azure Container Registry enables you to replicate images to the selected Azure regions and provides continued access to images even if a region experiences an outage.

## Failover process

If the passive cluster isn't functioning properly because of an issue in its specific Azure region, you can activate the cold cluster and redirect all traffic to that cluster's region. You can use this process while the passive cluster is deactivated until it starts working again. The cold cluster can take a couple minutes to come online, as it has been turned off and needs to complete the setup process. This approach isn't ideal for time-sensitive applications. In that case, we recommend considering an [active-active failover](active-active-solution#failover-process).

### Application Pods (Regional)

A Kubernetes deployment object creates multiple replicas of a pod (*ReplicaSet*). If one is unavailable, traffic is routed between the remaining replicas. The Kubernetes *ReplicaSet* attempts to keep the specified number of replicas up and running. If one instance goes down, a new instance should be recreated. [Liveness probes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe) can check the state of the application or process running in the pod. If the pod is unresponsive, the liveness probe removes the pod, which forces the *ReplicaSet* to create a new instance.

For more information, see [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

### Application Pods (Global)

When an entire region becomes unavailable, the pods in the cluster are no longer available to serve requests. In this case, the Azure Front Door instance routes all traffic to the remaining health regions. The Kubernetes clusters and pods in these regions continue to serve requests. To compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster, keep in mind the following guidance:

- Make sure network and compute resources are right sized to absorb any sudden increase in traffic due to region failover. For example, when using Azure Container Network Interface (CNI), make sure you have a subnet that can support all pod IPs with a spiked traffic load.
- Use the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler)to increase the pod replica count to compensate for the increased regional demand. - Use the AKS
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to increase the Kubernetes instance node counts to compensate for the increased regional demand.

### Kubernetes node pools (Regional)

Occasionally, localized failure can occur to compute resources, such as power becoming unavailable in a single rack of Azure servers. To protect your AKS nodes from becoming a single point regional failure, use [Azure Availability Zones](availability-zones). Availability zones ensure that AKS nodes in each availability zone are physically separated from those defined in another availability zones.

### Kubernetes node pools (Global)

In a complete regional failure, Azure Front Door routes traffic to the remaining healthy regions. Again, make sure to compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster.

## Failover testing strategy

While there are no mechanisms currently available within AKS to take down an entire region of deployment for testing purposes, [Azure Chaos Studio](/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-overview) offers the ability to create a chaos experiment on your cluster.
