# Use Windows HostProcess containers

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

HostProcess / Privileged containers extend the Windows container model to enable a wider range of Kubernetes cluster management scenarios. HostProcess containers run directly on the host and maintain behavior and access similar to that of a regular process. HostProcess containers allow users to package and distribute management operations and functionalities that require host access while retaining versioning and deployment methods provided by containers.

A privileged DaemonSet can carry out changes or monitor a Linux host on Kubernetes but not Windows hosts. HostProcess containers are the Windows equivalent of host elevation.

## Limitations

- HostProcess containers require Kubernetes 1.23 or greater.
- HostProcess containers require
`containerd`

1.6 or higher container runtime. - HostProcess pods can only contain HostProcess containers due to a limitation on the Windows operating system. Non-privileged Windows containers can't share a vNIC with the host IP namespace.
- HostProcess containers run as a process on the host. The only isolation those containers have from the host is the resource constraints imposed on the HostProcess user account.
- Filesystem isolation and Hyper-V isolation aren't supported for HostProcess containers.
- Volume mounts are supported and are mounted under the container volume. See Volume Mounts.
- A limited set of host user accounts are available for Host Process containers by default. See Choosing a User Account.
- Resource limits such as disk, memory, and cpu count, work the same way as fashion as processes on the host.
- Named pipe mounts and Unix domain sockets aren't directly supported, but can be accessed on their host path, for example
`\\.\pipe\*`

.

## Run a HostProcess workload

To use HostProcess features with your deployment, set *hostProcess: true* and *hostNetwork: true*:

```
spec:
...
securityContext:
windowsOptions:
hostProcess: true
...
hostNetwork: true
containers:
...
```


To run an example workload that uses HostProcess features on an existing AKS cluster with Windows nodes, create `hostprocess.yaml`

with the following contents:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
name: privileged-daemonset
namespace: kube-system
labels:
app: privileged-daemonset
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: privileged-daemonset
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: privileged-daemonset
spec:
nodeSelector:
kubernetes.io/os: windows
securityContext:
windowsOptions:
hostProcess: true
runAsUserName: "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"
hostNetwork: true
containers:
- name: powershell
image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2019 # or nanoserver:ltsc2022
command:
- powershell.exe
- -Command
- Start-Sleep -Seconds 2147483
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
```


Use `kubectl`

to run the example workload:

```
kubectl apply -f hostprocess.yaml
```


You should see the following output:

```
$ kubectl apply -f hostprocess.yaml
daemonset.apps/privileged-daemonset created
```


Verify that your workload uses the features of HostProcess containers by viewing the pod's logs.

Use `kubectl`

to find the name of the pod in the `kube-system`

namespace.

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
...
privileged-daemonset-12345 1/1 Running 0 2m13s
```


Use `kubectl log`

to view the logs of the pod and verify the pod has administrator rights:

```
$ kubectl logs privileged-daemonset-12345 --namespace kube-system
InvalidOperation: Unable to find type [Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal].
Process has admin rights:
```

# Customize cluster egress with a user-defined routing table in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can customize the egress for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to fit specific scenarios. AKS provisions a `Standard`

SKU load balancer for egress by default. However, the default setup may not meet the requirements of all scenarios if public IPs are disallowed or the scenario requires extra hops for egress.

This article walks through how to customize a cluster's egress route to support custom network scenarios. These scenarios include ones which disallow public IPs and require the cluster to sit behind a network virtual appliance (NVA).

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.0.81 or greater. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - API version
`2020-01-01`

or greater.

## Requirements and limitations

Using outbound type is an advanced networking scenario and requires proper network configuration. The following requirements and limitations apply to using outbound type:

- Setting
`outboundType`

requires AKS clusters with a`vm-set-type`

of`VirtualMachineScaleSets`

and a`load-balancer-sku`

of`Standard`

. - Setting
`outboundType`

to a value of`UDR`

requires a user-defined route with valid outbound connectivity for the cluster. - Setting
`outboundType`

to a value of`UDR`

implies the ingress source IP routed to the load-balancer may**not match**the cluster's outgoing egress destination address.

## Overview of customizing egress with a user-defined routing table

AKS doesn't automatically configure egress paths if `userDefinedRouting`

is set, which means you must configure the egress.

When you don't use standard load balancer (SLB) architecture, you must establish explicit egress. You must deploy your AKS cluster into an existing virtual network with a subnet that has been previously configured. This architecture requires explicitly sending egress traffic to an appliance like a firewall, gateway, or proxy, so a public IP assigned to the standard load balancer or appliance can handle the Network Address Translation (NAT).

### Load balancer creation with `userDefinedRouting`


AKS clusters with an outbound type of UDR get a standard load balancer only when the first Kubernetes service of type `loadBalancer`

is deployed. The load balancer is configured with a public IP address for *inbound* requests and a backend pool for *inbound* requests. The Azure cloud provider configures inbound rules, but it **doesn't configure outbound public IP address or outbound rules**. Your UDR is the only source for egress traffic.

Note

Azure load balancers [don't incur a charge until a rule is placed](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/load-balancer/).

## Deploy a cluster with outbound type of UDR and Azure Firewall

To see an application of a cluster with outbound type using a user-defined route, see this [restrict egress traffic with Azure firewall example](limit-egress-traffic).

Important

Outbound type of UDR requires a route for 0.0.0.0/0 and a next hop destination of NVA in the route table.
The route table already has a default 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet. Without a public IP address for Azure to use for Source Network Address Translation (SNAT), simply adding this route won't provide you outbound Internet connectivity. AKS validates that you don't create a 0.0.0.0/0 route pointing to the Internet but instead to a gateway, NVA, etc.
When using an outbound type of UDR, a load balancer public IP address for **inbound requests** isn't created unless you configure a service of type *loadbalancer*. AKS never creates a public IP address for **outbound requests** if you set an outbound type of UDR.
