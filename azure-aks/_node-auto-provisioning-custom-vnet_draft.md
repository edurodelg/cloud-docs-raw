This article shows you how to create a virtual network (VNet) and subnet, create a managed identity with permissions to access the VNet, and create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in your custom VNet with node auto-provisioning (NAP) enabled.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version
`2.76.0`

or later. To find the version, run`az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). - Read the
[Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning)article, which details[how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work). - Read the
[Overview of networking configurations for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](node-auto-provisioning-networking).

## Limitations

- When creating a NAP cluster in a custom virtual network (VNet), you must use a
[Standard Load Balancer](load-balancer-standard). The Basic Load Balancer isn't supported. - To review other limitations and unsupported features for NAP, see the
[Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features)article.

## Create a virtual network and subnet

Important

When using a custom VNet with NAP keep the following information in mind:

- You must create and delegate an API server subnet to
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same VNet. The minimum supported API server subnet size is*/28*. - All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. However, if you added network security group (NSG) rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, you need to ensure you configure the proper permissions. For more information, see the
[Network security group documentation](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

Create a VNet using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`az network vnet create \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --location $LOCATION \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/16`

Create a subnet using the

command and delegate it to`az network vnet subnet create`

`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

.`az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --delegations Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/28`


## Create a managed identity and give it permissions to access the VNet

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location $LOCATION`

Get the principal ID of the managed identity and set it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $IDENTITY_NAME --query principalId -o tsv)`

Assign the

*Network Contributor*role to the managed identity using thecommand.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create \ --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME" \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee $IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID`


## Create an AKS cluster with node auto-provisioning (NAP) in a custom VNet

Create an AKS cluster with NAP enabled in your custom VNet using the

command. Make sure to set the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag to`Auto`

to enable NAP.The following command also sets the

`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

. For more information on networking configurations supported with NAP, see[Configure networking for node auto-provisioning on AKS](node-autoprovision-networking).`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --location $LOCATION \ --assign-identity "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/$IDENTITY_NAME" \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --vnet-subnet-id "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$CUSTOM_VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME" \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

# Draft for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft) is an open-source project that streamlines Kubernetes development by taking a non-containerized application and generating the Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configurations, and other artifacts associated with a containerized application. Draft can also create a GitHub Action workflow file to quickly build and deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster.

## How it works

Draft has the following commands to help ease your development on Kubernetes:

`draft create`

: Creates the Dockerfile and the proper manifest files.`draft setup-gh`

: Sets up your GitHub OIDC.`draft generate-workflow`

: Generates the GitHub Action workflow file for deployment onto your cluster.`draft up`

: Sets up your GitHub OIDC and generates a GitHub Action workflow file, combining the previous two commands.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - Install the latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows)and the*aks-preview*extension. - If you don't have one already, you need to create an
[AKS cluster](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster)and an Azure Container Registry instance.

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Create artifacts using `draft create`


You can use `draft create`

to create Dockerfiles, Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or Kustomize files needed to deploy your application onto an AKS cluster.

Create an artifact using the

command.`az aks draft create`

`az aks draft create`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft create --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Set up GitHub OIDC using `draft setup-gh`


To use Draft, you have to register your application with GitHub using `draft setup-gh`

. This step only needs to be done once per repository.

Register your application with GitHub using the

command.`az aks draft setup-gh`

`az aks draft setup-gh`


## Generate a GitHub Action workflow file for deployment using `draft generate-workflow`


After you create your artifacts and set up GitHub OIDC, you can use `draft generate-workflow`

to generate a GitHub Action workflow file, creating an action that deploys your application onto your AKS cluster. Once your workflow file is generated, you must commit it into your repository in order to initiate the GitHub Action.

Generate a GitHub Action workflow file using the

command.`az aks draft generate-workflow`

`az aks draft generate-workflow`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft generate-workflow --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Set up GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) and generate a GitHub Action workflow file using `draft up`


`draft up`

is a single command to accomplish GitHub OIDC setup and generate a GitHub Action workflow file for deployment. It effectively combines the `draft setup-gh`

and `draft generate-workflow`

commands, meaning it's most commonly used when getting started in a new repository for the first time, and only needs to be run once. Subsequent updates to the GitHub Action workflow file can be made using `draft generate-workflow`

.

Set up GitHub OIDC and generate a GitHub Action workflow file using the

command.`az aks draft up`

`az aks draft up`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft up --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Use Application Routing with Draft to make your application accessible over the internet

Application Routing][app-routing](app-routing) is the easiest way to get your web application up and running in Kubernetes securely. Application Routing removes the complexity of ingress controllers and certificate and DNS management, and it offers configuration for enterprises looking to bring their own. Application Routing offers a managed ingress controller based on nginx that you can use without restrictions and integrates out of the box with Open Service Mesh to secure intra-cluster communications.

Set up Draft with Application Routing using the

and pass in the DNS name and Azure Key Vault-stored certificate when prompted.`az aks draft update`

`az aks draft update`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft update --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`
