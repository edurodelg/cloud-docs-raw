Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In a container-based, microservices approach to application development, application components work together to process their tasks. Kubernetes provides various resources enabling this cooperation:

- You can connect to and expose applications internally or externally.
- You can build highly available applications by load balancing your applications.
- You can restrict the flow of network traffic into or between pods and nodes to improve security.
- You can configure Ingress traffic for SSL/TLS termination or routing of multiple components for your more complex applications.

This article introduces the core concepts that provide networking to your applications in AKS:

## Kubernetes networking basics

Kubernetes employs a virtual networking layer to manage access within and between your applications or their components:

**Kubernetes nodes and virtual network**: Kubernetes nodes are connected to a virtual network. This setup enables pods (basic units of deployment in Kubernetes) to have both inbound and outbound connectivity.**Kube-proxy component**: kube-proxy runs on each node and is responsible for providing the necessary network features.

Regarding specific Kubernetes functionalities:

**Load balancer**: You can use a load balancer to distribute network traffic evenly across various resources.**Ingress controllers**: These facilitate Layer 7 routing, which is essential for directing application traffic.**Egress traffic control**: Kubernetes allows you to manage and control outbound traffic from cluster nodes.**Network policies**: These policies enable security measures and filtering for network traffic in pods.

In the context of the Azure platform:

- Azure streamlines virtual networking for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) clusters.
- Creating a Kubernetes load balancer on Azure simultaneously sets up the corresponding Azure load balancer resource.
- As you open network ports to pods, Azure automatically configures the necessary network security group rules.
- Azure can also manage external DNS configurations for HTTP application routing as new Ingress routes are established.

## Azure virtual networks

In AKS, you can deploy a cluster that uses one of the following network models:

**Overlay network model**: Overlay networking is the most common networking model used in Kubernetes. Pods are given an IP address from a private, logically separate CIDR from the Azure virtual network subnet where AKS nodes are deployed. This model enables simpler, improved scalability when compared to the flat network model.**Flat network model**: A flat network model in AKS assigns IP addresses to pods from a subnet from the same Azure virtual network as the AKS nodes. Any traffic leaving your clusters isn't SNAT'd, and the pod IP address is directly exposed to the destination. This model can be useful for scenarios like exposing pod IP addresses to external services.

For more information on networking models in AKS, see [CNI Networking in AKS](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Control outbound (egress) traffic

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network and have outbound dependencies on services outside of that virtual network, which are almost entirely defined with fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). AKS provides several outbound configuration options which allow you to customize the way in which these external resources are accessed.

Note

After [31 March 2026](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=default-outbound-access-for-vms-in-azure-will-be-retired-transition-to-a-new-method-of-internet-access), new AKS clusters that use the **AKS-managed virtual network** option will place cluster subnets into [private subnets](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access#why-is-disabling-default-outbound-access-recommended) by default (`defaultOutboundAccess = false`

).

This setting **does not impact AKS-managed cluster traffic**, which uses explicitly configured outbound paths. It may affect **unsupported scenarios**, such as deploying other resources (e.g., VMs) into the same subnet.

**Clusters using BYO VNets are unaffected** by this change. In supported configurations, no action is required.

### Outbound configuration options

For more information on the supported AKS cluster outbound configuration types, see [Customize cluster egress with outbound types in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](egress-outboundtype).

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound (egress) Internet access, which allows the nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If desired, you can restrict outbound traffic.

For more information on how to restrict outbound traffic from your cluster see [Control egress traffic for cluster nodes in AKS](limit-egress-traffic).

## Network security groups

A network security group filters traffic for VMs like the AKS nodes. As you create Services, such as a *LoadBalancer*, the Azure platform automatically configures any necessary network security group rules.

You don't need to manually configure network security group rules to filter traffic for pods in an AKS cluster. You can define any required ports and forwarding as part of your Kubernetes Service manifests and let the Azure platform create or update the appropriate rules.

You can also use network policies to automatically apply traffic filter rules to pods.

For more information, see [How network security groups filter network traffic](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-group-how-it-works).

### Custom virtual network requirements

When using a custom virtual network with AKS clusters, if you have added Network Security Group (NSG) rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, ensure that the NSG security rules permit the following types of communication:

| Destination | Source | Protocol | Port | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Cluster Subnet | TCP | 443 and 4443 | Required to enable communication between Nodes and the API server. |
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Azure Load Balancer | TCP | 9988 | Required to enable communication between Azure Load Balancer and the API server. You can also enable all communication between the Azure Load Balancer and the API Server Subnet CIDR. |
| Node CIDR | Node CIDR | All Protocols | All Ports | Required to enable communication between Nodes. |
| Node CIDR | Pod CIDR | All Protocols | All Ports | Required for Service traffic routing. |
| Pod CIDR | Pod CIDR | All Protocols | All Ports | Required for Pod to Pod and Pod to Service traffic, including DNS. |

These requirements apply to both AKS Standard and AKS Automatic clusters when using custom virtual networks.

## Network policies

By default, all pods in an AKS cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations. For improved security, define rules that control the flow of traffic, like:

- Back-end applications are only exposed to required frontend services.
- Database components are only accessible to the application tiers that connect to them.

Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You can allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. While network security groups are better for AKS nodes, network policies are a more suited, cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

For more information, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-network-policies).

## Next steps

To get started with AKS networking, create and configure an AKS cluster with your own IP address ranges using [Azure CNI Overlay](azure-cni-overlay) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni).

# In transit encryption with WireGuard (public preview)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As organizations increasingly rely on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to run containerized workloads, ensuring the security of network traffic between applications and services becomes essential especially in regulated or security-sensitive environments. In-transit encryption with WireGuard protects data as it moves between pods and nodes, mitigating risks of interception or tampering. WireGuard is known for its simplicity, and robust cryptography, offers a powerful solution for securing communication within AKS clusters.

WireGuard encryption for AKS is part of the [Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) feature set, and its implementation is based on [Cilium](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/).

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## WireGuard encryption scope

WireGuard in-transit encryption in AKS is designed to secure specific traffic flows within your Kubernetes cluster. This section outlines which traffic types are encrypted and which aren't currently supported via Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS).

Supported/Encrypted traffic flows:

- Inter-node pod traffic: Traffic leaving a pod from one node destined to a pod on another node.

Unsupported/Unencrypted traffic flows

- Same-node pod traffic: Traffic between pods on the same node
- Node-network traffic: traffic generated by the node itself destined to another node

## Architecture overview

WireGuard encryption relies on [Azure CNI powered by cilium](azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) to secure inter-node communications within a distributed system. The architecture uses a dedicated WireGuard agent that orchestrates key management, interface configuration, and dynamic peer updates. This section attempts to provide a detailed explanation

### WireGuard agent

Upon startup, the Cilium agent evaluates its configuration to determine if encryption is enabled. When WireGuard is selected as the encryption mode, the agent initializes a dedicated WireGuard subsystem. The wireguard agent is responsible for configuring and initializing components required for enforcing WireGuard encryption.

### Key generation

A fundamental requirement to secure communication is the generation of cryptographic key pairs. Each node in the Kubernetes cluster will automatically generate a unique WireGuard key pair during the initialization phase and distributes its public key via the “network.cilium.io/wg-pub-key” annotation in the Kubernetes CiliumNode custom resource object. The key pairs are stored in memory and rotated every 120 seconds. The private key serves as the node’s confidential identity. The public key is shared with the peer nodes in the cluster to decrypt and encrypt traffic from and to Cilium-managed endpoints running on that node. These keys are managed entirely by Azure, not by the customer, ensuring secure and automated handling without requiring manual intervention. This mechanism ensures that only nodes with validated credentials can participate in the encrypted network.

### Interface creation

Once the key generation process concludes, the WireGuard agent configures a dedicated network interface (cilium_wg0). This process involves interface creation and configuration with the previously generated private key.

## Comparison with virtual network encryption

Azure offers multiple options for securing in-transit traffic in AKS, including [virtual network level encryption](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview) and WireGuard-based encryption. While both approaches enhance the confidentiality and integrity of network traffic, they differ in scope, flexibility, and deployment requirements. This section helps you understand when to use each solution.

**Use virtual network encryption when**

**You require full network-layer encryption for all traffic within the virtual network:**Virtual network encryption ensures that all traffic regardless of workload or orchestration layer is automatically encrypted as it traverses the Azure Virtual Network.**You need minimal performance overhead:**Virtual network encryption uses hardware acceleration in supported VM SKUs, offloading encryption from the OS to the underlying hardware. This design delivers high throughput with low CPU usage.**All your virtual machines support virtual network encryption:**Virtual network encryption depends on VM SKUs that support the necessary hardware acceleration. If your infrastructure consists entirely of supported SKUs, virtual network encryption can be seamlessly enabled.**Your AKS Network configurations supports virtual network encryption:**Virtual network encryption has some limitations when it comes to aks pod networking. For more information, see[Virtual network encryption supported scenarios](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview#supported-scenarios)

**Use WireGuard encryption When**

**You want to make sure that your application traffic is encrypted across all node**virtual network encryption does not encrypt traffic between nodes on the same physical host.**You want to unify encryption across multi-cloud or hybrid environments:**WireGuard offers a cloud-agnostic solution, enabling consistent encryption across clusters running in different cloud providers or on-premises.**You don’t need or want to encrypt all traffic within the virtual network:**WireGuard enables a more targeted encryption strategy ideal for securing sensitive workloads without incurring the overhead of encrypting all traffic.**Some of your VM SKUs don’t support virtual network encryption:**WireGuard is implemented in software and works regardless of VM hardware support, making it a practical option for heterogeneous environments.

## Considerations & limitations

• WireGuard isn't [FIPS](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final) compliant.
• WireGuard encryption doesn't apply to pods uses host networking (spec.hostNetwork: true) because these pods use the host identity instead of having individual identities.

Important

WireGuard encryption operates at the software level, which can introduce latency and impact throughput performance. The extent of this impact depends on various factors, including VM size (node SKU), network configuration, and application traffic patterns. Our benchmarking indicates that throughput is limited to 1.5 Gbps with an MTU of 1500; however, results may vary depending on workload characteristics and cluster configuration. Using a SKU that supports MTU 3900 resulted in approximately 2.5x higher throughput. While WireGuard encryption can be used alongside network policies, doing so may lead to further performance degradation, with reduced throughput and increased latency. For applications sensitive to latency or throughput, we strongly recommend evaluating WireGuard in a non-production environment first. As always, results may vary based on workload characteristics and cluster configuration.
