Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and AKS clusters. To provide this communication, you create a virtual network subnet and assign delegated permissions. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). By default, AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet). This article shows you how to create a virtual network and subnets, then deploy an AKS cluster that uses advanced networking.

This article shows you how to use the Azure CLI to create and configure virtual network resources and an AKS cluster enabled with virtual nodes.

## Before you begin

Important

Before using virtual nodes with AKS, review both the [limitations of AKS virtual nodes](virtual-nodes) and the [virtual networking limitations of ACI](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-virtual-network-concepts). These limitations affect the location, networking configuration, and other configuration details of both your AKS cluster and the virtual nodes.

You need the ACI service provider registered with your subscription. You can check the status of the ACI provider registration using the

command.`az provider list`

`az provider list --query "[?contains(namespace,'Microsoft.ContainerInstance')]" -o table`

The

*Microsoft.ContainerInstance*provider should report as*Registered*, as shown in the following example output:`Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy --------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- Microsoft.ContainerInstance Registered RegistrationRequired`

If the provider shows as

*NotRegistered*, register the provider using the.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerInstance`

If using Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.49 or later. Run

`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can also use[Azure Cloud Shell](#launch-azure-cloud-shell).

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured.

To open the Cloud Shell, select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/bash](https://shell.azure.com/bash). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`


## Create a virtual network

Important

Virtual node requires a custom virtual network and associated subnet. It can't be associated with the same virtual network as the AKS cluster.

Create a virtual network using the

command. The following example creates a virtual network named`az network vnet create`

*myVnet*with an address prefix of*10.0.0.0/8*and a subnet named*myAKSSubnet*. The address prefix of this subnet defaults to*10.240.0.0/16*.`az network vnet create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myVnet \ --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 \ --subnet-name myAKSSubnet \ --subnet-prefix 10.240.0.0/16`

Create an extra subnet for the virtual nodes using the

command. The following example creates a subnet named`az network vnet subnet create`

*myVirtualNodeSubnet*with an address prefix of*10.241.0.0/16*.`az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --vnet-name myVnet \ --name myVirtualNodeSubnet \ --address-prefixes 10.241.0.0/16`


## Create an AKS cluster with managed identity

Get the subnet ID using the

command.`az network vnet subnet show`

`az network vnet subnet show --resource-group myResourceGroup --vnet-name myVnet --name myAKSSubnet --query id -o tsv`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and replace`az aks create`

`<subnetId>`

with the ID obtained in the previous step. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*with five nodes.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 5 \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id <subnetId> \ --generate-ssh-keys`

After several minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


For more information on managed identities, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

## Enable the virtual nodes addon

Note

If you have an existing Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster created that uses Azure CNI for the Advanced Networking you should be able to enable virtual nodes as an add-on using the CLI.

Enable virtual nodes using the

command. The following example uses the subnet named`az aks enable-addons`

*myVirtualNodeSubnet*created in a previous step.`az aks enable-addons \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --addons virtual-node \ --subnet-name myVirtualNodeSubnet`


## Connect to the cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. This step downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command, which returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the single VM node created and the virtual node for Linux,

*virtual-node-aci-linux*:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION virtual-node-aci-linux Ready agent 28m v1.11.2 aks-agentpool-14693408-0 Ready agent 32m v1.11.2`


## Deploy a sample app

Create a file named

`virtual-node.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. The YAML schedules the container on the node by defining a[nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)and[toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: aci-helloworld spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: aci-helloworld template: metadata: labels: app: aci-helloworld spec: containers: - name: aci-helloworld image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld ports: - containerPort: 80 nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/role: agent kubernetes.io/os: linux type: virtual-kubelet tolerations: - key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider operator: Exists - key: azure.com/aci effect: NoSchedule`

Run the application using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f virtual-node.yaml`

Get a list of pods and the scheduled node using the

command with the`kubectl get pods`

`-o wide`

argument.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The pod is scheduled on the virtual node

*virtual-node-aci-linux*, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE aci-helloworld-9b55975f-bnmfl 1/1 Running 0 4m 10.241.0.4 virtual-node-aci-linux`

The pod is assigned an internal IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet delegated for use with virtual nodes.


Note

If you use images stored in Azure Container Registry, [configure and use a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). A current limitation of virtual nodes is you can't use integrated Microsoft Entra service principal authentication. If you don't use a secret, pods scheduled on virtual nodes fail to start and report the error `HTTP response status code 400 error code "InaccessibleImage"`

.

## Test the virtual node pod

Test the pod running on the virtual node by browsing to the demo application with a web client. As the pod is assigned an internal IP address, you can quickly test this connectivity from another pod on the AKS cluster.

Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it using the following

`kubectl run -it`

command.`kubectl run -it --rm testvk --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

Install

`curl`

in the pod using`apt-get`

.`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

Access the address of your pod using

`curl`

, such as. Provide your own internal IP address shown in the previous[http://10.241.0.4](http://10.241.0.4)`kubectl get pods`

command.`curl -L http://10.241.0.4`

The demo application is displayed, as shown in the following condensed example output:

`<html> <head> <title>Welcome to Azure Container Instances!</title> </head> [...]`

Close the terminal session to your test pod with

`exit`

. When your session is ends, the pod is deleted.

## Remove virtual nodes

Delete the

`aci-helloworld`

pod running on the virtual node using the`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete -f virtual-node.yaml`

Disable the virtual nodes using the

command.`az aks disable-addons`

`az aks disable-addons --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --addons virtual-node`

Remove the virtual network resources and resource group using the following commands.

`# Change the name of your resource group, cluster and network resources as needed RES_GROUP=myResourceGroup AKS_CLUSTER=myAKScluster AKS_VNET=myVnet AKS_SUBNET=myVirtualNodeSubnet # Get AKS node resource group NODE_RES_GROUP=$(az aks show --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --query nodeResourceGroup --output tsv) # Get network profile ID NETWORK_PROFILE_ID=$(az network profile list --resource-group $NODE_RES_GROUP --query "[0].id" --output tsv) # Delete the network profile az network profile delete --id $NETWORK_PROFILE_ID -y # Grab the service association link ID SAL_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $RES_GROUP --vnet-name $AKS_VNET --name $AKS_SUBNET --query id --output tsv)/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/serviceAssociationLinks/default # Delete the service association link for the subnet az resource delete --ids $SAL_ID --api-version 2021-10-01 # Delete the subnet delegation to Azure Container Instances az network vnet subnet update --resource-group $RES_GROUP --vnet-name $AKS_VNET --name $AKS_SUBNET --remove delegations`


## Next steps

In this article, you scheduled a pod on the virtual node and assigned a private internal IP address. You could instead create a service deployment and route traffic to your pod through a load balancer or ingress controller. For more information, see [Create a basic ingress controller in AKS](ingress-basic).

Virtual nodes are often one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:

# Best practices for advanced scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the kube-scheduler

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. Advanced features provided by the Kubernetes scheduler let you control:

- Which pods can be scheduled on certain nodes.
- How multi-pod applications can be appropriately distributed across the cluster.

This best practices article focuses on advanced Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Use taints and tolerations to limit what pods can be scheduled on nodes.
- Give preference to pods to run on certain nodes with node selectors or node affinity.
- Split apart or group together pods with inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity.
- Restrict scheduling of workloads that require GPUs only on nodes with schedulable GPUs.

If additional capabilities or ML frameworks are needed to schedule and queue batch workloads, you can [install and configure Kueue on AKS](kueue-overview) to ensure efficient, policy-driven scheduling in AKS clusters.

If fine-grained scheduler configuration is needed to optimize how pods and jobs prioritize specific nodes, storage resources, topology, and more, you can [configure a scheduler on AKS](concepts-scheduler-configuration).

## Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations


Best practice guidance:Limit access for resource-intensive applications, such as ingress controllers, to specific nodes. Keep node resources available for workloads that require them, and don't allow scheduling of other workloads on the nodes.


When you create your AKS cluster, you can deploy nodes with GPU support or a large number of powerful CPUs. For more information, see [Use GPUs on AKS](gpu-cluster). You can use these nodes for large data processing workloads such as machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI).

Because this node resource hardware is typically expensive to deploy, limit the workloads that can be scheduled on these nodes. Instead, dedicate some nodes in the cluster to run ingress services and prevent other workloads.

This support for different nodes is provided by using multiple node pools. An AKS cluster supports one or more node pools.

The Kubernetes scheduler uses taints and tolerations to restrict what workloads can run on nodes.

- Apply a
**taint**to a node to indicate only specific pods can be scheduled on them. - Then apply a
**toleration**to a pod, allowing them to*tolerate*a node's taint.

When you deploy a pod to an AKS cluster, Kubernetes only schedules pods on nodes whose taint aligns with the toleration. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods aren't scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node, marking the node so that it doesn't accept any pods that don't tolerate the taints.

For example, assume you added a node pool in your AKS cluster for nodes with GPU support. You define name, such as *gpu*, then a value for scheduling. Setting this value to *NoSchedule* restricts the Kubernetes scheduler from scheduling pods with undefined toleration on the node.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name taintnp \
--node-taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \
--no-wait
```


With a taint applied to nodes in the node pool, you define a toleration in the pod specification that allows scheduling on the nodes. The following example defines the `sku: gpu`

and `effect: NoSchedule`

to tolerate the taint applied to the node pool in the previous step:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
tolerations:
- key: "sku"
operator: "Equal"
value: "gpu"
effect: "NoSchedule"
```


When this pod is deployed using `kubectl apply -f gpu-toleration.yaml`

, Kubernetes can successfully schedule the pod on the nodes with the taint applied. This logical isolation lets you control access to resources within a cluster.

When you apply taints, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to define the required tolerations in their deployments.

For more information about how to use multiple node pools in AKS, see [Create multiple node pools for a cluster in AKS](create-node-pools).

### Behavior of taints and tolerations in AKS

When you upgrade a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations follow a set pattern as they're applied to new nodes:

#### Default clusters that use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

You can [taint a node pool](manage-node-pools#specify-a-taint-label-or-tag-for-a-node-pool) from the AKS API to have newly scaled out nodes receive API specified node taints.

Let's assume:

- You begin with a two-node cluster:
*node1*and*node2*. - You upgrade the node pool.
- Two other nodes are created:
*node3*and*node4*. - The taints are passed on respectively.
- The original
*node1*and*node2*are deleted.

#### Clusters without Virtual Machine Scale Sets support

Again, let's assume:

- You have a two-node cluster:
*node1*and*node2*. - You upgrade the node pool.
- An extra node is created:
*node3*. - The taints from
*node1*are applied to*node3*. *node1*is deleted.- A new
*node1*is created to replace to original*node1*. - The
*node2*taints are applied to the new*node1*. *node2*is deleted.

In essence, *node1* becomes *node3*, and *node2* becomes the new *node1*.

When you scale a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations don't carry over by design.

## Control pod scheduling using node selectors and affinity


Best practice guidanceControl the scheduling of pods on nodes using node selectors, node affinity, or inter-pod affinity. These settings allow the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads, such as by hardware in the node.


Taints and tolerations logically isolate resources with a hard cut-off. If the pod doesn't tolerate a node's taint, it isn't scheduled on the node.

Alternatively, you can use node selectors. For example, you label nodes to indicate locally attached SSD storage or a large amount of memory, and then define in the pod specification a node selector. Kubernetes schedules those pods on a matching node.

Unlike tolerations, pods without a matching node selector can still be scheduled on labeled nodes. This behavior allows unused resources on the nodes to consume, but prioritizes pods that define the matching node selector.

Let's look at an example of nodes with a high amount of memory. These nodes prioritize pods that request a high amount of memory. To ensure the resources don't sit idle, they also allow other pods to run. The following example command adds a node pool with the label *hardware=highmem* to the *myAKSCluster* in the *myResourceGroup*. All nodes in that node pool have this label.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name labelnp \
--node-count 1 \
--labels hardware=highmem \
--no-wait
```


A pod specification then adds the `nodeSelector`

property to define a node selector that matches the label set on a node:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
nodeSelector:
hardware: highmem
```


When you use these scheduler options, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to correctly define their pod specifications.

For more information about using node selectors, see [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/).

### Node affinity

A node selector is a basic solution for assigning pods to a given node. *Node affinity* provides more flexibility, allowing you to define what happens if the pod can't be matched with a node. You can:

*Require*that Kubernetes scheduler matches a pod with a labeled host. Or,*Prefer*a match but allow the pod to be scheduled on a different host if no match is available.

The following example sets the node affinity to *requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution*. This affinity requires the Kubernetes schedule to use a node with a matching label. If no node is available, the pod has to wait for scheduling to continue. To allow the pod to be scheduled on a different node, you can instead set the value to * preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution*:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
affinity:
nodeAffinity:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
- key: hardware
operator: In
values:
- highmem
```


The *IgnoredDuringExecution* part of the setting indicates that the pod shouldn't be evicted from the node if the node labels change. The Kubernetes scheduler only uses the updated node labels for new pods being scheduled, not pods already scheduled on the nodes.

For more information, see [Affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

### Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity

One final approach for the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads is using inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity. These settings define that pods either *shouldn't* or *should* be scheduled on a node that has an existing matching pod. By default, the Kubernetes scheduler tries to schedule multiple pods in a replica set across nodes. You can define more specific rules around this behavior.

For example, you have a web application that also uses an Azure Cache for Redis.

- You use pod anti-affinity rules to request that the Kubernetes scheduler distributes replicas across nodes.
- You use affinity rules to ensure each web app component is scheduled on the same host as a corresponding cache.

The distribution of pods across nodes looks like the following example:

Node 1 |
Node 2 |
Node 3 |
|---|---|---|
| webapp-1 | webapp-2 | webapp-3 |
| cache-1 | cache-2 | cache-3 |

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity provide a more complex deployment than node selectors or node affinity. With the deployment, you logically isolate resources and control how Kubernetes schedules pods on nodes.

For a complete example of this web application with Azure Cache for Redis example, see [Co-locate pods on the same node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#always-co-located-in-the-same-node).
