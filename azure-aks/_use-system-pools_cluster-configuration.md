Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. Node pools contain the underlying VMs that run your applications. System node pools and user node pools are two different node pool modes for your AKS clusters. System node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting critical system pods such as `CoreDNS`

and `metrics-server`

. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods. However, application pods can be scheduled on system node pools if you wish to only have one pool in your AKS cluster. Every AKS cluster must contain at least one system node pool with at least two nodes.

Important

If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool.

This article explains how to manage system node pools in AKS. For information about how to use multiple node pools, see [use multiple node pools](use-multiple-node-pools).

## Before you begin

You need the Azure CLI version 2.3.1 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support system node pools.

- See
[Quotas, VM size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions). - An API version of 2020-03-01 or greater must be used to set a node pool mode. Clusters created on API versions older than 2020-03-01 contain only user node pools, but can be migrated to contain system node pools by following
[update pool mode steps](#update-existing-cluster-system-and-user-node-pools). - The name of a node pool may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter. For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1 and 12 characters. For Windows node pools, the length must be between one and six characters.
- The mode of a node pool is a required property and must be explicitly set when using ARM templates or direct API calls.

## System and user node pools

For a system node pool, AKS automatically assigns the label **kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system** to its nodes. This causes AKS to prefer scheduling system pods on node pools that contain this label. This label doesn't prevent you from scheduling application pods on system node pools. However, we recommend you isolate critical system pods from your application pods to prevent misconfigured or rogue application pods from accidentally deleting system pods.

You can enforce this behavior by creating a dedicated system node pool. Use the `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule`

taint to prevent application pods from being scheduled on system node pools.

System node pools have the following restrictions:

- System node pools must support at least 30 pods as described by the
[minimum and maximum value formula for pods](concepts-network-ip-address-planning#maximum-pods-per-node). - System pools osType must be Linux.
- User node pools osType may be Linux or Windows.
- System pools must contain at least two nodes, and user node pools may contain zero or more nodes.
- System node pools require a VM SKU of at least 4 vCPUs and 4GB memory.
[B series VMs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-b-series-burstable)are not supported for system node pools.- A minimum of three nodes of 8 vCPUs or two nodes of at least 16 vCPUs is recommended (for example, Standard_DS4_v2), especially for large clusters (Multiple CoreDNS Pod replicas, 3-4+ add-ons, etc.).
- Spot node pools require user node pools.
- Adding another system node pool or changing which node pool is a system node pool
*does not*automatically move system pods. System pods can continue to run on the same node pool, even if you change it to a user node pool. If you delete or scale down a node pool running system pods that were previously a system node pool, those system pods are redeployed with preferred scheduling to the new system node pool.

You can do the following operations with node pools:

- Create a dedicated system node pool (prefer scheduling of system pods to node pools of
`mode:system`

) - Change a system node pool to be a user node pool, provided you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster.
- Change a user node pool to be a system node pool.
- Delete user node pools.
- You can delete system node pools, provided you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster.
- An AKS cluster may have multiple system node pools and requires at least one system node pool.
- If you want to change various immutable settings on existing node pools, you can create new node pools to replace them. One example is to add a new node pool with a new maxPods setting and delete the old node pool.
- Use
[node affinity](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)to*require*or*prefer*which nodes can be scheduled based on node labels. You can set`key`

to`kubernetes.azure.com`

,`operator`

to`In`

, and`values`

of either`user`

or`system`

to your YAML, applying this definition using`kubectl apply -f yourYAML.yaml`

.

## Create a new AKS cluster with a system node pool

When you create a new AKS cluster, the initial node pool defaults to a mode of type `system`

. When you create new node pools with `az aks nodepool add`

, those node pools are user node pools unless you explicitly specify the mode parameter.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region.

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```


Use the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one dedicated system pool containing two nodes. For your production workloads, ensure you're using system node pools with at least three nodes. This operation may take several minutes to complete.

```
# Create a new AKS cluster with a single system pool
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 2 --generate-ssh-keys
```


## Add a dedicated system node pool to an existing AKS cluster

You can add one or more system node pools to existing AKS clusters. It's recommended to schedule your application pods on user node pools, and dedicate system node pools to only critical system pods. This prevents rogue application pods from accidentally deleting system pods. Enforce this behavior with the `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule`

[taint](manage-node-pools#set-node-pool-taints) for your system node pools.

The following command adds a dedicated node pool of mode type system with a default count of three nodes.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name systempool \
--node-count 3 \
--node-taints CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule \
--mode System
```


## Show details for your node pool

You can check the details of your node pool with the following command.

```
az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name systempool
```


A mode of type **System** is defined for system node pools, and a mode of type **User** is defined for user node pools. For a system pool, verify the taint is set to `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoSchedule`

, which will prevent application pods from beings scheduled on this node pool.

```
{
"agentPoolType": "VirtualMachineScaleSets",
"availabilityZones": null,
"count": 3,
"enableAutoScaling": null,
"enableNodePublicIp": false,
"id": "/subscriptions/yourSubscriptionId/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster/agentPools/systempool",

},

"vnetSubnetId": null
}
```


## Update existing cluster system and user node pools

Note

An API version of 2020-03-01 or greater must be used to set a system node pool mode. Clusters created on API versions older than 2020-03-01 contain only user node pools as a result. To receive system node pool functionality and benefits on older clusters, update the mode of existing node pools with the following commands on the latest Azure CLI version.

You can change modes for both system and user node pools. You can change a system node pool to a user pool only if another system node pool already exists on the AKS cluster.

This command changes a system node pool to a user node pool.

```
az aks nodepool update --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool --mode user
```


This command changes a user node pool to a system node pool.

```
az aks nodepool update --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool --mode system
```


## Delete a system node pool

Note

To use system node pools on AKS clusters before API version 2020-03-02, add a new system node pool, then delete the original default node pool.

You must have at least two system node pools on your AKS cluster before you can delete one of them.

```
az aks nodepool delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool
```


## Clean up resources

To delete the cluster, use the [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to delete the AKS resource group:

```
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create and manage system node pools in an AKS cluster. For information about how to start and stop AKS node pools, see [start and stop AKS node pools](start-stop-nodepools).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes core concepts of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and operate containerized applications at scale on Azure.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## What is AKS?

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications that use Kubernetes. For more information, see [What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?](what-is-aks).

## Cluster components

An AKS cluster is divided into two main components:

**Control plane**: The control plane provides the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.**Nodes**: Nodes are the underlying virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

Note

AKS managed components have the label `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby`

: `aks`

.

AKS manages the Helm releases with the prefix `aks-managed`

. Continuously increasing revisions on these releases are expected and safe.

### Control plane

The Azure managed control plane is composed of several components that help manage the cluster:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kube-apiserver` |
The API server (
|

`etcd`

[etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd)helps to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.`kube-scheduler`

[kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)) helps to make scheduling decisions. It watches for new pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.`kube-controller-manager`

[kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)) runs controller processes, such as noticing and responding when nodes go down.`cloud-controller-manager`

[cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager)) embeds cloud-specific control logic to run controllers specific to the cloud provider.### Nodes

Each AKS cluster has at least one node, which is an Azure VM that runs Kubernetes node components. The following components run on each node:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kubelet` |
The
|

`kube-proxy`

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)is a network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes.`container runtime`

[container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime)manages the execution and lifecycle of containers.## Node configuration

Configure the following settings for nodes.

### VM size and image

The *Azure VM size* for your nodes defines CPUs, memory, size, and the storage type available, such as a high-performance solid-state drive or a regular hard-disk drive. The VM size you choose depends on the workload requirements and the number of pods that you plan to run on each node. As of May 2025, the default VM SKU and size will be dynamically selected by AKS based on available capacity and quota if the parameter is left blank during deployment. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes).

In AKS, the *VM image* for your cluster's nodes is based on Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), or Windows Server 2022. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform automatically creates and configures the requested number of VMs. Agent nodes are billed as standard VMs. Any VM size discounts, including [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations), are automatically applied.

### OS disks

Default OS disk sizing is used on new clusters or node pools only when a default OS disk size isn't specified. This behavior applies to both managed and ephemeral OS disks. For more information, see [Default OS disk sizing](concepts-storage#default-os-disk-sizing).

### Resource reservations

AKS uses node resources to help the nodes function as part of the cluster. This usage can cause a discrepancy between the node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS. To maintain node performance and functionality, AKS reserves two types of resources, CPU and memory, on each node. For more information, see [Resource reservations in AKS](node-resource-reservations).

### OS

AKS supports two linux distros: Ubuntu and Azure Linux. Ubuntu is the default Linux distro on AKS. Windows node pools are also supported on AKS with the [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/en-us/windows-server/get-started/servicing-channels-comparison) as the default channel on AKS. For more information on default OS versions, see documentation on [node images](node-images).

### Container runtime

A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. The runtime helps abstract away system calls or OS-specific functionality to run containers on Linux or Windows. For Linux node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is used on Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher. For Windows Server 2019 and 2022 node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is generally available and is the only runtime option on Kubernetes version 1.23 and higher.

## Pods

A *pod* is a group of one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, but you can run multiple containers in a pod.

## Node pools

In AKS, nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. These node pools contain the underlying virtual machine scale sets and virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

When you create an AKS cluster, you define the initial number of nodes and their size (version), which creates a [system node pool](use-system-pools). System node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting critical system pods, such as CoreDNS and `konnectivity`

.

To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, you can create *user node pools*. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods.

For more information, see [Create node pools in AKS](create-node-pools) and [Manage node pools in AKS](manage-node-pools).

## Node resource group

When you create an AKS cluster in an Azure resource group, the AKS resource provider automatically creates a second resource group called the *node resource group*. This resource group contains all the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster, including VMs, virtual machine scale sets, and storage.

For more information, see the following resources:

[Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](faq)[Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?](faq)[Can I modify tags and other properties of the resources in the AKS node resource group?](faq)

## Namespaces

Kubernetes resources, such as pods and deployments, are logically grouped into *namespaces* to divide an AKS cluster and create, view, or manage access to resources.

The following namespaces are created by default in an AKS cluster:

| Namespace | Description |
|---|---|
`default` |
The
|

`kube-node-lease`

[kube-node-lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace enables nodes to communicate their availability to the control plane.`kube-public`

[kube-public](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace isn't typically used, but you can use it so that resources are visible across the whole cluster by any user.`kube-system`

[kube-system](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace is used by Kubernetes to manage cluster resources, such as`coredns`

, `konnectivity-agent`

, and `metrics-server`

. It is not recommended to deploy your own applications to this namespace. For rare cases where deploying your own applications to this namespace is necessary, see the [FAQ](faq#can-admission-controller-webhooks-affect-kube-system-and-internal-aks-namespaces-)to learn how.## Cluster modes

In AKS, you can create a cluster with the Automatic or Standard mode. AKS Automatic provides a more fully managed experience. You can manage cluster configuration, including nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings. AKS Standard provides more control over the cluster configuration, including the ability to manage node pools, scaling, and other settings.

For more information, see [AKS Automatic and Standard feature comparison](intro-aks-automatic#aks-automatic-and-standard-feature-comparison).

## Pricing tiers

AKS offers three pricing tiers for cluster management: Free, Standard, and Premium. The pricing tier you choose determines the features that are available for managing your cluster.

For more information, see [Pricing tiers for AKS cluster management](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

## Supported Kubernetes versions

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions in AKS](supported-kubernetes-versions).
