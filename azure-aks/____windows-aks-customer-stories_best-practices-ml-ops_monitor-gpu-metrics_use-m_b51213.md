# Machine learning operations (MLOps) best practices in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes best practices and considerations to keep in mind when using MLOps in AKS. For more information on MLOps, see [Machine learning operations (MLOps) for AI and machine learning workflows](concepts-machine-learning-ops).

## Infrastructure as code (IaC)

[IaC](/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) enables consistent and reproducible infrastructure provisioning and management for a range of application types. With intelligent application deployments, your IaC implementation might change throughout the AI pipeline, as the compute power and resources needed for inferencing, serving, training, and fine-tuning models can vary. Defining and versioning IaC templates for your AI developer teams can help ensure consistency and cost-effectiveness across job types while demystifying their individual hardware requirements and accelerating the deployment process.

## Containerization

Managing your model weights, metadata, and configurations in container images allows for portability, simplified versioning, and reduced storage costs over time. With containerization, you can:

- Leverage existing container images, especially for large language models (LLMs) ranging in millions to billions of parameters in size and stable diffusion models, stored in secure container registries.
- Avoid single point of failure (SPOF) in your pipeline with the use of multiple lightweight containers containing the unique dependencies for each task instead of maintaining one large image.
- Store large text/image datasets outside of your base container image and reference them when needed at runtime.

[Get started with the Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator](ai-toolchain-operator) to deploy a high performance LLM on AKS in a matter of minutes.

## Model management and versioning

Model management and versioning are essential for tracking changes to your models over time. By versioning your models, you can:

- Maintain consistency across your model containers for ease of deployment in different environments.
- Employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to iterate faster on a subset of model weights and maintain new versions in lightweight containers.

## Automation

Automation is key to reducing manual errors, increasing efficiency, and ensuring consistency across the ML lifecycle. By automating tasks, you can:

- Integrate alerting tools to automatically trigger a vector ingestion flow as new data flows into your application.
- Set model performance thresholds to track degradations and trigger retraining pipelines.

## Scalability and resource management

Scalability and resource management are critical for ensuring that your AI pipeline can handle the demands of your application. By optimizing your resource usage, you can:

- Integrate tools that efficiently use your allocated CPU, GPU, and memory resources through distributed computing and multiple levels of parallelism (for example: data, model, and pipeline parallelism).
- Enable autoscaling on your compute resources to support high model request volumes at peak times and scale down in off-peak hours.
- Similar to your traditional applications, plan for disaster recovery by following
[AKS resiliency and reliability best practices](ha-dr-overview).

## Security and compliance

Security and compliance are critical for protecting your data and ensuring that your AI pipeline meets regulatory requirements. By implementing security and compliance best practices, you can:

- Integrate common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) scanning to detect common vulnerabilities on open-source model container images.
- Use
[Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction)for model container images stored in your Azure Container Registry.

- Use
- Maintain an audit trail of the ingested data, model changes, and metrics to remain compliant with your organizational policies.

# Learn about NVIDIA GPU metrics to optimize GPU performance and utilization on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Efficient placement and optimization of GPU workloads often requires visibility into resource utilization and performance. Managed GPU metrics on AKS (preview) provide automated collection and exposure of GPU utilization, memory, and performance data across NVIDIA GPU-enabled node pools. This enables platform administrators to optimize cluster resources and developers to tune and debug workloads with limited manual instrumentation.

In this article, you learn about GPU metrics collected by the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager [(DCGM) exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/tree/main) with [a fully managed GPU-enabled node pool (preview)](aks-managed-gpu-nodes) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with
[a fully managed GPU-enabled node pool (preview)](aks-managed-gpu-nodes)and ensure that the[GPUs are schedulable](use-nvidia-gpu#confirm-that-gpus-are-schedulable). - A
[sample GPU workload](use-nvidia-gpu#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload)deployed to your node pool.

## Limitations

- Managed GPU metrics is not currently supported with
[Azure Managed Prometheus or Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable).

## Verify that managed GPU components are installed

After creating your managed NVIDIA GPU node pool (preview) following [these instructions](aks-managed-gpu-nodes), confirm that the GPU software components were installed with the [az aks nodepool show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command:

```
az aks nodepool show \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--cluster-name <cluster-name> \
--name <node-pool-name> \
```


Your output should include the following values:

```
...
...
"gpuInstanceProfile": …
"gpuProfile": {
"driver": "Install"
},
...
...
```


## Understanding GPU metrics

### GPU Utilization Metrics

GPU Utilization metrics show the percentage of time the GPU’s cores are actively processing work. High values indicate that the GPU is heavily used, which is generally desirable for workloads like training or data processing. Interpretation of this metric should consider the type of workload: AI training typically keeps utilization high, while inference may have intermittent utilization due to bursty traffic.

Memory Utilization: Shows the percentage of GPU memory in use. High memory usage without high GPU utilization can indicate memory-bound workloads where the GPU waits on memory transfers. Low memory usage with low utilization may suggest the workload is too small to fully leverage the GPU.

SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) Efficiency: Measures the efficiency with which the GPU’s cores are used. A low SM efficiency indicates that cores are idle or underutilized due to workload imbalance or suboptimal kernel design. High efficiency is ideal for compute-heavy applications.

### Memory Metrics

Memory Bandwidth Utilization: Reflects how much of the theoretical memory bandwidth is being consumed. High bandwidth utilization with low compute utilization can indicate a memory-bound workload. Conversely, high utilization in both compute and memory bandwidth suggests a well-balanced workload.

Memory Errors: Tracks ECC (Error-Correcting Code) errors if enabled. A high number of errors may indicate hardware degradation or thermal issues and should be monitored for reliability.

### Temperature and Power Metrics

GPU Temperature: Indicates the operating temperature of the GPU. Sustained high temperatures can trigger thermal throttling, reducing performance. Ideal interpretation of this metric involves observing temperature relative to the GPU’s thermal limits and cooling capacity.

Power Usage: Shows instantaneous power draw. Comparing power usage to TDP (Thermal Design Power) helps understand whether the GPU is being pushed to its limits. Sudden drops in power may indicate throttling or underutilization.

### Clocks and Frequency Metrics

GPU Clock: The actual operating frequency of the GPU. Combined with utilization, this helps determine if the GPU is throttling or underperforming relative to its potential.

Memory Clock: Operating frequency of GPU memory. Memory-bound workloads may benefit from higher memory clocks; a mismatch between memory and compute utilization can highlight bottlenecks.

### PCIe and NVLink Metrics

PCIe Bandwidth: Measures the throughput over the PCIe bus. Low utilization with heavy workloads may suggest CPU-GPU communication is not a bottleneck. High utilization could point to data transfer limitations impacting performance.

NVLink Bandwidth: This metric is similar to PCIe bandwidth but specific to NVLink interconnects, and relevant in multi-GPU systems for cross-GPU communication. High NVLink usage with low SM utilization may indicate synchronization or data transfer delays.

### Error and Reliability Metrics

Retired Pages and XID Errors: Track GPU memory errors and critical failures. Frequent occurrences signal potential hardware faults and require attention for long-running workloads.

### Interpretation Guidance

DCGM metrics should always be interpreted contextually with the type of your workload on AKS. A high compute-intensive workload should ideally show high GPU and SM utilization, high memory bandwidth usage, stable temperatures below throttling thresholds, and power draw near but below TDP.

Memory-bound workloads might show high memory utilization and bandwidth but lower compute utilization. Anomalies such as low utilization with high temperature or power consumption often indicate throttling, inefficient scheduling, or system-level bottlenecks.

Monitoring trends over time rather than single snapshots is critical. Sudden drops in utilization or spikes in errors often reveal underlying issues before they impact production workloads. Comparing metrics across multiple GPUs can also help identify outliers or misbehaving devices in a cluster. Understanding these metrics in combination, rather than isolation, provides the clearest insight into GPU efficiency and workload performance.

## Common GPU metrics

The following NVIDIA DCGM metrics are commonly evaluated for performance of GPU node pools on Kubernetes:

| GPU Metric Name | Meaning | Typical Range / Indicator | Usage Tip |
|---|---|---|---|
`DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL` |
GPU utilization (% time GPU cores are active) | 0–100% (higher is better) | Monitor per-node and per-pod; low values may indicate CPU or I/O bottlenecks |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_SM_UTIL` |
Streaming Multiprocessor efficiency (% active cores) | 0–100% | Low values with high memory usage indicate a memory-bound workload |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` |
Framebuffer memory used (bytes) | 0 to total memory | Use pod GPU memory limits and track per-pod memory usage |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_FREE` |
Free GPU memory (bytes) | 0 to total memory | Useful for scheduling and to avoid OOM errors |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_MEMORY_UTIL` |
Memory utilization (%) | 0–100% | Combine with GPU/SM utilization to determine memory-bound workloads |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_MEMORY_CLOCK` |
Current memory clock frequency (MHz) | 0 to max memory clock | Low values under high memory utilization may indicate throttling |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE` |
Instantaneous power usage (Watts) | 0 to TDP | Drops during high utilization may indicate throttling |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_TEMPERATURE` |
GPU temperature (°C) | ~30–85°C normal | Alert on sustained high temperatures |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_NVLINK_RX` |
NVLink receive bandwidth utilization (%) | 0–100% | Multi-GPU synchronization bottleneck if high with low SM utilization |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_XID_ERRORS` |
GPU critical errors reported by driver | Typically 0 | Immediate investigation required; can taint node in Kubernetes |

# Use a managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to enable and use a system-assigned, user-assigned, or pre-created kubelet managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## AKS managed identity prerequisites

Read the

[Overview of managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](managed-identity-overview)to understand the different types of managed identities available in AKS and how you can use them to securely access Azure resources.Before running the examples in this article, set your subscription as the current active subscription using the

command.`az account set`

`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

Create an Azure resource group if you don't already have one by calling the

command.`az group create`

`az group create \ --name <resource-group-name> \ --location <location>`


### Azure CLI version minimum requirements

- Make sure you have Azure CLI version 2.23.0 or later installed. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - To
[use a pre-created kubelet managed identity](use-managed-identity#create-a-kubelet-managed-identity), you need Azure CLI version 2.26.0 or later installed. - To update an existing cluster to use a
[system-assigned managed identity](use-managed-identity#update-an-existing-aks-cluster-to-use-a-system-assigned-managed-identity)or[a user-assigned managed identity](use-managed-identity#update-an-existing-cluster-to-use-a-user-assigned-managed-identity), you need Azure CLI version 2.49.0 or later installed.

### Limitations

Moving or migrating a managed identity-enabled cluster to a different tenant isn't supported.

If the cluster has Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (

`aad-pod-identity`

) enabled, Node-Managed Identity (NMI) pods modify the iptables of the nodes to intercept calls to the Azure Instance Metadata (IMDS) endpoint. This configuration means any request made to the IMDS endpoint is intercepted by NMI, even if a particular pod doesn't use`aad-pod-identity`

.The AzurePodIdentityException custom resource definition (CRD) can be configured to specify that requests to the IMDS endpoint that originate from a pod matching labels defined in the CRD should be proxied without any processing in NMI. Exclude the system pods with the

`kubernetes.azure.com/managedby: aks`

label in*kube-system*namespace in`aad-pod-identity`

by configuring the AzurePodIdentityException CRD. For more information, see[Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service](use-azure-ad-pod-identity).To configure an exception, install the

[mic-exception YAML](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/blob/master/deploy/infra/mic-exception.yaml).AKS doesn't support the use of a system-assigned managed identity when using a custom private DNS zone.

The USDOD Central, USDOD East, and USGov Iowa regions in Azure US Government cloud don't support creating a cluster with a user-assigned managed identity.


A pre-created kubelet managed identity must be a user-assigned managed identity.

The China East and China North regions in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet aren't supported.

Important

All Microsoft Defender for Cloud features will be officially retired in the Azure in China region on August 18, 2026. Due to this upcoming retirement, Azure in China customers are no longer able to onboard new subscriptions to the service. A new subscription is any subscription that was not already onboarded to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service prior to August 18, 2025, the date of the retirement announcement. For more information on the retirement, see

[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Deprecation in Microsoft Azure Operated by 21Vianet Announcement](https://aka.ms/mdcretirementinchina).Customers should work with their account representatives for Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet to assess the impact of this retirement on their own operations.


### Update cluster considerations

When you update a cluster, consider the following information:

- An update only works if there's a VHD update to consume. If you're running the latest VHD, you need to wait until the next VHD is available in order to perform the update.
- The Azure CLI ensures your addon's permission is correctly set after migrating. If you're not using the Azure CLI to perform the migrating operation, you need to handle the addon identity's permission by yourself. For an example using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, see
[Assign Azure roles using ARM templates](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-template). - If your cluster was using
`--attach-acr`

to pull from images from Azure Container Registry (ACR), you need to run the`az aks update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name> --attach-acr <acr-resource-id>`

command after updating your cluster to let the newly created kubelet used for managed identity get the permission to pull from ACR. Otherwise, you won't be able to pull from ACR after the update.

## Enable a system-assigned managed identity on an AKS cluster

### Enable a system-assigned managed identity on a new AKS cluster

A system-assigned managed identity is enabled by default when you create a new AKS cluster.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update an existing AKS cluster to use a system-assigned managed identity

Update an existing AKS cluster from a service principal to a system-assigned managed identity using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-managed-identity`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --enable-managed-identity`

After you update the cluster to use a system-assigned managed identity instead of a service principal, the control plane and pods use the system-assigned managed identity for authorization when accessing other services in Azure. Kubelet continues using a service principal until you also upgrade your agent pool. You can use the

`az aks nodepool upgrade --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <aks-cluster-name> --name <node-pool-name> --node-image-only`

command on your nodes to update to a managed identity. A node pool upgrade causes downtime for your AKS cluster as the nodes in the node pools are cordoned, drained, and reimaged.

## Get the principal ID of a system-assigned managed identity

Get the principal ID for the cluster's system-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az aks show`

`CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --query identity.principalId \ --output tsv)`


## Add a role assignment for a system-assigned managed identity

Assign an Azure RBAC role to the system-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az role assignment create`

For a VNet, attached Azure disk, static IP address, or route table outside the default worker node resource group, you need to assign the

`Network Contributor`

role on the custom resource group.The following example assigns the

**Network Contributor**role to the system-assigned managed identity. The role assignment is scoped to the resource group that contains the VNet.`az role assignment create \ --assignee <client-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --scope <custom-resource-group-id>`

Note

It can take up to 60 minutes for the permissions granted to your cluster's managed identity to propagate.


## Create a user-assigned managed identity

If you don't yet have a user-assigned managed identity resource, create one using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create \ --name <identity-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`{ "clientId": "<client-id>", "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>", "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<identity-name>", "location": "<location>", "name": "<identity-name>", "principalId": "<principal-id>", "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>", "tags": {}, "tenantId": "<tenant-id>", "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities" }`


## Get the principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity

Get the principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity show`

`CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show \ --name <identity-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --query principalId \ --output tsv)`


## Get the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity

Get the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity show`

`RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show \ --name <identity-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --query id \ --output tsv)`


## Assign an Azure RBAC role to the user-assigned managed identity

Add a role assignment for the user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az role assignment create`

The following example assigns the

**Key Vault Secrets User**role to the user-assigned managed identity to grant it permissions to access secrets in a key vault. The role assignment is scoped to the key vault resource:`az role assignment create \ --assignee <client-id> \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \ --scope "<keyvault-resource-id>"`

Note

It can take up to 60 minutes for the permissions granted to your cluster's managed identity to propagate.


## Enable a user-assigned managed identity on an AKS cluster

### Enable a user-assigned managed identity on a new AKS cluster

Create an AKS cluster with the user-assigned managed identity using the

command. Include the`az aks create`

`--assign-identity`

parameter and pass in the resource ID for the user-assigned managed identity:`az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id <vnet-subnet-id> \ --dns-service-ip 10.2.0.10 \ --service-cidr 10.2.0.0/24 \ --assign-identity $RESOURCE_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update an existing cluster to use a user-assigned managed identity

Update an existing cluster to use a user-assigned managed identity using the

command. Include the`az aks update`

`--assign-identity`

parameter and pass in the resource ID for the user-assigned managed identity:`az aks update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --enable-managed-identity \ --assign-identity $RESOURCE_ID`

The output for a successful cluster update to use a user-assigned managed identity should resemble the following example output:

`"identity": { "principalId": null, "tenantId": null, "type": "UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": { "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<identity-name>": { "clientId": "<client-id>", "principalId": "<principal-id>" } } },`

Note

Migrating a managed identity for the control plane from system-assigned to user-assigned doesn't result in any downtime for control plane and agent pools. Control plane components continue to the old system-assigned identity for up to several hours, until the next token refresh.


## Determine which type of managed identity a cluster is using

Verify which type of managed identity your cluster is using with the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --query identity.type \ --output tsv`

If the cluster is using a managed identity, the value of the

*type*property will be either**SystemAssigned**or**UserAssigned**.If the cluster is using a service principal, the value of the

*type*property will be null. Consider upgrading your cluster to use a managed identity.

## Create a kubelet managed identity

If you don't have a kubelet managed identity, create one using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create \ --name <kubelet-identity-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`{ "clientId": "<client-id>", "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>", "id": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<kubelet-identity-name>", "location": "<location>", "name": "<kubelet-identity-name>", "principalId": "<principal-id>", "resourceGroup": "<resource-group-name>", "tags": {}, "tenantId": "<tenant-id>", "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities" }`


## Assign an RBAC role to the kubelet managed identity

Assign the

`acrpull`

role on the kubelet managed identity using thecommand.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create \ --assignee <kubelet-client-id> \ --role "acrpull" \ --scope "<acr-registry-id>"`


## Enable a kubelet managed identity on an AKS cluster

### Enable a kubelet managed identity on a new AKS cluster

Create an AKS cluster with your existing identities using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id <vnet-subnet-id> \ --dns-service-ip 10.2.0.10 \ --service-cidr 10.2.0.0/24 \ --assign-identity <identity-resource-id> \ --assign-kubelet-identity <kubelet-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`

A successful AKS cluster creation using a kubelet managed identity should result in output similar to the following:

`"identity": { "principalId": null, "tenantId": null, "type": "UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": { "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<identity-name>": { "clientId": "<client-id>", "principalId": "<principal-id>" } } }, "identityProfile": { "kubeletidentity": { "clientId": "<client-id>", "objectId": "<object-id>", "resourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<kubelet-identity-name>" } },`


### Update an existing cluster to use a kubelet managed identity

To update an existing cluster to use the kubelet managed identity, first get the current control plane managed identity for your AKS cluster.

Warning

Updating the kubelet managed identity upgrades your AKS cluster's node pools, make sure you have the right availability configurations, such as Pod Disruption Budgets, configured before executing this to avoid workload disruption or execute this during a maintenance window.

Confirm your AKS cluster is using the user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --query "servicePrincipalProfile"`

If your cluster is using a managed identity, the output shows

`clientId`

with a value of**msi**. A cluster using a service principal shows an object ID. For example:`# The cluster is using a managed identity. { "clientId": "msi" }`

After confirming your cluster is using a managed identity, find the managed identity's resource ID using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --query "identity"`

For a user-assigned managed identity, your output should look similar to the following example output:

`{ "principalId": null, "tenantId": null, "type": "UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": <identity-resource-id> "clientId": "<client-id>", "principalId": "<principal-id>" },`

Update your cluster with your existing identities using the

command. Provide the resource ID of the user-assigned managed identity for the control plane for the`az aks update`

`assign-identity`

argument. Provide the resource ID of the kubelet managed identity for the`assign-kubelet-identity`

argument.`az aks update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --enable-managed-identity \ --assign-identity <identity-resource-id> \ --assign-kubelet-identity <kubelet-identity-resource-id>`

Your output for a successful cluster update using your own kubelet managed identity should resemble the following example output:

`"identity": { "principalId": null, "tenantId": null, "type": "UserAssigned", "userAssignedIdentities": { "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<identity-name>": { "clientId": "<client-id>", "principalId": "<principal-id>" } } }, "identityProfile": { "kubeletidentity": { "clientId": "<client-id>", "objectId": "<object-id>", "resourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<kubelet-identity-name>" } },`


## Get the properties of the kubelet managed identity

Get the properties of the kubelet managed identity using the

command and query on the`az aks show`

`identityProfile.kubeletidentity`

property.`az aks show \ --name <aks-cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --query "identityProfile.kubeletidentity"`

# Install existing applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers, such as *APT* and *Yum*, you can use Helm to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This article shows you how to configure and use Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Your AKS cluster needs to have
**an integrated ACR**. For details on creating an AKS cluster with an integrated ACR, see[Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration#create-a-new-acr). - You also need the Helm CLI installed, which is the client that runs on your development system. It allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, the Helm CLI is already installed. For installation instructions on your local platform, see
[Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Important

Helm is intended to run on Linux nodes. If you have Windows Server nodes in your cluster, you must ensure that Helm pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes. You also need to ensure that any Helm charts you install are also scheduled to run on the correct nodes. The commands in this article use [node-selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) to make sure pods are scheduled to the correct nodes, but not all Helm charts may expose a node selector. You can also consider using other options on your cluster, such as [taints](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler).

## Verify your version of Helm

Use the

`helm version`

command to verify you have Helm 3 installed.`helm version`

The following example output shows Helm version 3.0.0 installed:

`version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.0.0", GitCommit:"e29ce2a54e96cd02ccfce88bee4f58bb6e2a28b6", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.4"}`


## Install an application with Helm v3

### Add Helm repositories

Add the

*ingress-nginx*repository using the[helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/#initialize-a-helm-chart-repository)command.`helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx`


### Find Helm charts

Search for precreated Helm charts using the

[helm search](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-search-finding-charts)command.`helm search repo ingress-nginx`

The following condensed example output shows some of the Helm charts available for use:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx 4.7.0 1.8.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a...`

Update the list of charts using the

[helm repo update](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-repo-working-with-repositories)command.`helm repo update`

The following example output shows a successful repo update:

`Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the "ingress-nginx" chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈`


## Import the Helm chart images into your ACR

This article uses the [NGINX ingress controller Helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/charts/ingress-nginx), which relies on three container images.

Use

`az acr import`

to import the NGINX ingress controller images into your ACR.`REGISTRY_NAME=<REGISTRY_NAME> CONTROLLER_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io CONTROLLER_IMAGE=ingress-nginx/controller CONTROLLER_TAG=v1.8.0 PATCH_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io PATCH_IMAGE=ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen PATCH_TAG=v20230407 DEFAULTBACKEND_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE=defaultbackend-amd64 DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG=1.5 az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $CONTROLLER_REGISTRY/$CONTROLLER_IMAGE:$CONTROLLER_TAG --image $CONTROLLER_IMAGE:$CONTROLLER_TAG az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $PATCH_REGISTRY/$PATCH_IMAGE:$PATCH_TAG --image $PATCH_IMAGE:$PATCH_TAG az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $DEFAULTBACKEND_REGISTRY/$DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE:$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG --image $DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE:$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG`

Note

In addition to importing container images into your ACR, you can also import Helm charts into your ACR. For more information, see

[Push and pull Helm charts to an Azure container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-helm-repos).

### Run Helm charts

Install Helm charts using the

[helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-install-installing-a-package)command and specify a release name and the name of the chart to install.Tip

The following example creates a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress resources named

*ingress-basic*and is intended to work within that namespace. Specify a namespace for your own environment as needed.`ACR_URL=<REGISTRY_URL> # Create a namespace for your ingress resources kubectl create namespace ingress-basic # Use Helm to deploy an NGINX ingress controller helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \ --version 4.0.13 \ --namespace ingress-basic \ --set controller.replicaCount=2 \ --set controller.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set controller.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set controller.image.image=$CONTROLLER_IMAGE \ --set controller.image.tag=$CONTROLLER_TAG \ --set controller.image.digest="" \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path"=/healthz \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.image=$PATCH_IMAGE \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.tag=$PATCH_TAG \ --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set defaultBackend.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set defaultBackend.image.image=$DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE \ --set defaultBackend.image.tag=$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG \ --set defaultBackend.image.digest=""`

The following condensed example output shows the deployment status of the Kubernetes resources created by the Helm chart:

`NAME: nginx-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jul 28 11:35:29 2021 NAMESPACE: ingress-basic STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The ingress-nginx controller has been installed. It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace ingress-basic get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller' ...`

Get the

*EXTERNAL-IP*of your service using the`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl --namespace ingress-basic get services -o wide -w ingress-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller`

The following example output shows the

*EXTERNAL-IP*for the*ingress-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller*service:`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller LoadBalancer 10.0.254.93 <EXTERNAL_IP> 80:30004/TCP,443:30348/TCP 61s app.kubernetes.io/component=controller,app.kubernetes.io/instance=nginx-ingress,app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx`


### List releases

Get a list of releases installed on your cluster using the

`helm list`

command.`helm list --namespace ingress-basic`

The following example output shows the

*ingress-nginx*release deployed in the previous step:`NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION ingress-nginx ingress-basic 1 2021-07-28 11:35:29.9623734 -0500 CDT deployed ingress-nginx-3.34.0 0.47.0`


### Clean up resources

Deploying a Helm chart creates Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, and services.

Clean up resources using the

[helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-uninstall-uninstalling-a-release)command and specify your release name.`helm uninstall --namespace ingress-basic ingress-nginx`

The following example output shows the release named

*ingress-nginx*has been uninstalled:`release "nginx-ingress" uninstalled`

Delete the entire sample namespace along with the resources using the

`kubectl delete`

command and specify your namespace name.`kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic`


## Next steps

For more information about managing Kubernetes application deployments with Helm, see the Helm documentation.

# Overview of eBPF Host Routing (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

As containerized workloads scale across distributed environments, the need for high-performance, low-latency networking becomes critical. eBPF Host Routing is a performance-focused feature within [Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) that uses extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to optimize traffic flow in Kubernetes clusters. Legacy routing on Kubernetes hosts introduces overhead in the form of iptables and netfilter rule processing in the host network namespace. eBPF Host Routing has benefits over legacy host routing by:

- Implementing the routing logic in eBPF programs.
- Allowing Cilium eBPF to bypass iptables in the host namespace.

This direct path reduces the number of hops and processing layers, resulting in faster packet delivery.

## Key benefits

Reduced latency - Bypassing iptables in host results in lower pod-to-pod latency

Increased throughput - Compared to legacy routing, significant improvements can be observed for pod-to-pod traffic between nodes

Reduced CPU usage - Due to removing iptables-based SNAT and routing logic, a modest reduction of CPU usage

Use cases for eBPF Host Routing are performance-critical workloads such as high-throughput microservices, real-time services, or AI/ML workloads. Ensure deployment environment meets the requirements before enabling.

## Components of eBPF Host Routing

** iptables blocker** - An init container that prevents any future installation of iptables rules in the host network namespace (such rules will be bypassed when eBPF host routing is enabled).

** IP Masquerade Agent** - When eBPF Host Routing is active, Cilium takes over SNAT responsibilities using BPF-based masquerading.

`ip-masq-agent`

remains running to maintain consistent behavior if eBPF Host Routing is later disabled; however, its iptables rules are ignored while eBPF Host Routing is active.## Considerations

Enabling eBPF Host Routing causes iptables rules in the host network namespace to be bypassed. Hence, AKS attempts to detect and block enablement of eBPF Host Routing on clusters where iptables rules are in use in the host network namespace.

On clusters with eBPF host routing enabled, AKS blocks attempts to install iptables rules in the host network namespace. Trying to bypass this block may cause the cluster to be inoperational.


## Limitations

eBPF host routing is currently incompatible with nodes running OSes other than Ubuntu 24.04, or Azure Linux 3.0. eBPF host routing is currently also not supported with Confidential VMs and Pod Sandboxing.

eBPF Host Routing can only be enabled for all nodes in a cluster. Hybrid node scenarios aren't supported.

Windows nodes aren't supported by Azure CNI Powered by Cilium, and by extension, eBPF Host Routing.

Istio add-on can't be used along with eBPF Host Routing enabled clusters.

Dual stack networking isn't supported.

# Upgrading Azure Kubernetes Service clusters and node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster needs to be periodically updated to ensure security and compatibility with the latest features. There are two components of an AKS cluster that are necessary to maintain:

*Cluster Kubernetes version*: Part of the AKS cluster lifecycle involves performing upgrades to the latest Kubernetes version. It’s important that you upgrade to apply the latest security releases and to get access to the latest Kubernetes features, as well as to stay within the[AKS support window](supported-kubernetes-versions#kubernetes-version-support-policy).*Node image version*: AKS regularly provides new node images with the latest OS and runtime updates. It's beneficial to upgrade your nodes' images regularly to ensure support for the latest AKS features and to apply essential security patches and hot fixes.

For Linux nodes, node image security patches and hotfixes may be performed without your initiation as *unattended updates*. These updates are automatically applied, but AKS doesn't automatically reboot your Linux nodes to complete the update process. You're required to use a tool like [kured](node-updates-kured) or [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) to reboot the nodes and complete the cycle.

The following table summarizes the details of updating each component:

| Component name | Frequency of upgrade | Planned Maintenance supported | Supported operation methods | Supported operation methods (Multi-Cluster) | Documentation link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cluster Kubernetes version upgrade (minor) | Roughly every three months | Yes | Automatic, Manual | Automatic, Manual |
|

[AKS release tracker](release-tracker)[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster),[Multi-cluster upgrade](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-update-orchestration)**Linux**: weekly**Windows**: monthly[AKS node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade),[Multi-cluster upgrade](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-update-orchestration)[AKS node security patches](concepts-vulnerability-management#worker-nodes)## Multi-cluster upgrade

When you have multiple clusters, an important practice that you should include as part of your upgrade process is remembering to follow commonly used deployment and testing patterns. Testing an upgrade in a development or test environment before deployment in production is an important step to ensure application functionality and compatibility with the target environment. It can help you identify and fix any errors, bugs, or issues that might affect the performance, security, or usability of the application or underlying infrastructure.

[Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/overview) has built-in support for [multi-cluster upgrades](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-update-orchestration) which implements the best practice above to minimize application disruptions caused by cluster upgrades. Besides allowing you to customize the order of upgrades of multiple clusters, it also allows you to use consistent node OS image versions across clusters in different regions.

## Automatic upgrades

Automatic upgrades can be performed through [auto upgrade channels](auto-upgrade-cluster) or via [GitHub Actions](node-upgrade-github-actions).

[Automatic multi-cluster upgrades](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/update-automation) can be performed through [Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/overview) to adopt the best practice of testing and verifying an upgrade in a development or test environment before production.

## Planned maintenance

[Planned maintenance](planned-maintenance) allows you to schedule weekly maintenance windows that will update your control plane and your kube-system pods, helping to minimize workload impact.

## Troubleshooting

To find details and solutions to specific issues, view the following troubleshooting guides:

## Next steps

# Quickstart: Develop on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Helm

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers like *APT* and *Yum*, Helm manages Kubernetes charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

In this quickstart, you use Helm to package and run an application on AKS. For information on installing an existing application using Helm, see [Install existing applications with Helm in AKS](kubernetes-helm).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)or[Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)installed.[Helm v3 installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Create an Azure Container Registry

You need to store your container images in an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to run your application in your AKS cluster using Helm. Your registry name must be unique within Azure and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. Only lowercase characters are allowed. The *Basic* SKU is a cost-optimized entry point for development purposes that provides a balance of storage and throughput.

Create an Azure resource group using the

[az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)command. The following example creates a resource group named*myResourceGroup*in the*eastus*location.`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create an Azure Container Registry with a unique name by calling the

[az acr create](/en-us/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-create)command. The following example creates an ACR named*myhelmacr*with the*Basic*SKU.`az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myhelmacr --sku Basic`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output. Take note of your

*loginServer*value for your ACR to use in a later step.`{ "adminUserEnabled": false, "creationDate": "2023-12-26T22:36:23.998425+00:00", "id": "/subscriptions/<ID>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/myhelmacr", "location": "eastus", "loginServer": "myhelmacr.azurecr.io", "name": "myhelmacr", "networkRuleSet": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", "sku": { "name": "Basic", "tier": "Basic" }, "status": null, "storageAccount": null, "tags": {}, "type": "Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

Your new AKS cluster needs access to your ACR to pull the container images and run them.

Create an AKS cluster using the

[az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)command with the`--attach-acr`

parameter to grant the cluster access to your ACR. The following example creates an AKS cluster named*myAKSCluster*and grants it access to the*myhelmacr*ACR. Make sure you replace`myhelmacr`

with the name of your ACR.`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --location eastus --attach-acr myhelmacr --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect a Kubernetes cluster locally, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using the[az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli)command.`az aks install-cli`

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the[az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials)command. The following command gets credentials for the AKS cluster named*myAKSCluster*in*myResourceGroup*.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


## Download the sample application

This quickstart uses the [Azure Vote application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis.git).

Clone the application from GitHub using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis.git`

Navigate to the

`azure-vote`

directory using the`cd`

command.`cd azure-voting-app-redis/azure-vote/`


## Build and push the sample application to ACR

Build and push the image to your ACR using the

[az acr build](/en-us/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-build)command. The following example builds an image named*azure-vote-front:v1*and pushes it to the*myhelmacr*ACR. Make sure you replace`myhelmacr`

with the name of your ACR.`az acr build --image azure-vote-front:v1 --registry myhelmacr --file Dockerfile .`


Note

You can also import Helm charts into your ACR. For more information, see [Push and pull Helm charts to an Azure container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-helm-repos).

## Create your Helm chart

Generate your Helm chart using the

`helm create`

command.`helm create azure-vote-front`

Update

*azure-vote-front/Chart.yaml*to add a dependency for the*redis*chart from the`https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

chart repository and update`appVersion`

to`v1`

, as shown in the following example:Note

The container image versions shown in this guide have been tested to work with this example but may not be the latest version available.

`apiVersion: v2 name: azure-vote-front description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes dependencies: - name: redis version: 17.3.17 repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami ... # This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be # incremented each time you make changes to the application. appVersion: v1`

Update your Helm chart dependencies using the

`helm dependency update`

command.`helm dependency update azure-vote-front`

Update

*azure-vote-front/values.yaml*with the following changes.- Add a
*redis*section to set the image details, container port, and deployment name. - Add a
*backendName*for connecting the frontend portion to the*redis*deployment. - Change
*image.repository*to`<loginServer>/azure-vote-front`

. - Change
*image.tag*to`v1`

. - Change
*service.type*to*LoadBalancer*.

For example:

`replicaCount: 1 backendName: azure-vote-backend-master redis: image: registry: mcr.microsoft.com repository: oss/bitnami/redis tag: 6.0.8 fullnameOverride: azure-vote-backend auth: enabled: false image: repository: myhelmacr.azurecr.io/azure-vote-front pullPolicy: IfNotPresent tag: "v1" ... service: type: LoadBalancer port: 80 ...`

- Add a
Add an

`env`

section to*azure-vote-front/templates/deployment.yaml*to pass the name of the*redis*deployment.`... containers: - name: {{ .Chart.Name }} securityContext: {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }} image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}" imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }} env: - name: REDIS value: {{ .Values.backendName }} ...`


## Run your Helm chart

Install your application using your Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command.`helm install azure-vote-front azure-vote-front/`

It takes a few minutes for the service to return a public IP address. Monitor progress using the

`kubectl get service`

command with the`--watch`

argument.`kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch`

When the service is ready, the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

value changes from`<pending>`

to an IP address. Press`CTRL+C`

to stop the`kubectl`

watch process.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE azure-vote-front LoadBalancer 10.0.18.228 <pending> 80:32021/TCP 6s ... azure-vote-front LoadBalancer 10.0.18.228 52.188.140.81 80:32021/TCP 2m6s`

Navigate to your application's load balancer in a browser using the

`<EXTERNAL-IP>`

to see the sample application.

## Delete the cluster

Remove your resource group, AKS cluster, Azure container registry, container images stored in the ACR, and all related resources using the

[az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete)command with the`--yes`

parameter to confirm deletion and the`--no-wait`

parameter to return to the command prompt without waiting for the operation to complete.`az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait`


Note

If you created your AKS cluster with a system-assigned managed identity (the default identity option in this quickstart), the identity is managed by the platform and doesn't require removal.

If you created your AKS cluster with a service principal, the service principal isn't removed when you delete the cluster. To remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion](kubernetes-service-principal#considerations-when-using-a-service-principal).

# Secure access to Azure OpenAI from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to secure access to Azure OpenAI from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Microsoft Entra Workload ID. You learn how to:

- Enable workload identities on an AKS cluster.
- Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity.
- Create a Microsoft Entra ID federated credential.
- Enable workload identity on a Kubernetes Pod.

Note

We recommend using Microsoft Entra Workload ID and managed identities on AKS for Azure OpenAI access because it enables a secure, passwordless authentication process for accessing Azure resources.

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - This article builds on
[Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on AKS](open-ai-quickstart). You should complete that article before you begin this one. - You need a custom domain name enabled on your Azure OpenAI account to use for Microsoft Entra authorization. For more information, see
[Custom subdomain names for Azure AI services](/en-us/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains).

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

The Microsoft Entra Workload ID and OIDC Issuer Endpoint features aren't enabled on AKS by default. You must enable them on your AKS cluster before you can use them.

Set the resource group name and AKS cluster resource group name variables.

`# Set the resource group variable RG_NAME=myResourceGroup # Set the AKS cluster name based on the resource group variable AKS_NAME=$(az resource list --resource-group $RG_NAME --resource-type Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters --query "[0].name" -o tsv)`

Enable the Microsoft Entra Workload ID and OIDC Issuer Endpoint features on your existing AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --enable-workload-identity \ --enable-oidc-issuer`

Get the AKS OIDC Issuer Endpoint URL using the

command.`az aks show`

`AKS_OIDC_ISSUER=$(az aks show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $AKS_NAME --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)`


## Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity

Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`# Set the managed identity name variable MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME=myIdentity # Create the managed identity az identity create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME`

Get the managed identity client ID and object ID using the

command.`az identity show`

`# Get the managed identity client ID MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query clientId -o tsv) # Get the managed identity object ID MANAGED_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query principalId -o tsv)`

Get the Azure OpenAI resource ID using the

command.`az resource list`

`AOAI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az resource list --resource-group $RG_NAME --resource-type Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts --query "[0].id" -o tsv)`

Grant the managed identity access to the Azure OpenAI resource using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create \ --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \ --assignee-object-id $MANAGED_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \ --scope $AOAI_RESOURCE_ID`


## Create a Microsoft Entra ID federated credential

Set the federated credential, namespace, and service account variables.

`# Set the federated credential name variable FEDERATED_CREDENTIAL_NAME=myFederatedCredential # Set the namespace variable SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE=default # Set the service account variable SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=ai-service-account`

Create the federated credential using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create \ --name ${FEDERATED_CREDENTIAL_NAME} \ --resource-group ${RG_NAME} \ --identity-name ${MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME} \ --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} \ --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`


## Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID on AKS

To use Microsoft Entra Workload ID on AKS, you need to make a few changes to the `ai-service`

deployment manifest.

### Create a ServiceAccount

Get the kubeconfig for your cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AKS_NAME`

Create a Kubernetes ServiceAccount using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`


### Enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on the Pod

Set the Azure OpenAI resource name, endpoint, and deployment name variables.

`# Get the Azure OpenAI resource name AOAI_NAME=$(az resource list \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --resource-type Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts \ --query "[0].name" -o tsv) # Get the Azure OpenAI endpoint AOAI_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AOAI_NAME \ --query properties.endpoint -o tsv) # Get the Azure OpenAI deployment name AOAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(az cognitiveservices account deployment list \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AOAI_NAME \ --query "[0].name" -o tsv)`

Redeploy the

`ai-service`

with the ServiceAccount and the`azure.workload.identity/use`

annotation set to`true`

using thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service azure.workload.identity/use: "true" spec: serviceAccountName: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: USE_AZURE_AD value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "${AOAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "${AOAI_ENDPOINT}" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi EOF`


### Test the application

Verify the new pod is running using the

command.`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get pods --selector app=ai-service`

Get the pod environment variables using the

command. The output demonstrates that the Azure OpenAI API key no longer exists in the Pod's environment variables.`kubectl describe pod`

`kubectl describe pod --selector app=ai-service`

Open a new terminal and get the IP of the store admin service using the following

`echo`

command.`echo "http://$(kubectl get svc/store-admin -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"`

Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address from the previous step.

Select

**Products**. You should be able to add a new product and get a description for it using Azure OpenAI.
