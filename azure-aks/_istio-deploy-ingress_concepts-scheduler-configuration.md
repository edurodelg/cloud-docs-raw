Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to deploy external or internal ingresses for the Istio service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

Note

When you perform a [minor revision upgrade](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrades-with-ingress-and-egress-gateways) of the Istio add-on, another deployment for the external / internal gateways will be created for the new control plane revision.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you followed the [documentation](istio-deploy-addon) to enable the Istio add-on on an AKS cluster, deploy a sample application, and set environment variables.

## Enable external ingress gateway

Note

If you need the ingress gateway pods scheduled onto particular nodes, you can use [AKS system nodes](/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools) or the `azureservicemesh/istio.replica.preferred`

node label. The pods have node affinities with a weighted preference of `100`

for AKS system nodes (labeled `kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system`

), and a weighted preference of `50`

for nodes labeled `azureservicemesh/istio.replica.preferred: true`

.

Use `az aks mesh enable-ingress-gateway`

to enable an externally accessible Istio ingress on your AKS cluster:

```
az aks mesh enable-ingress-gateway --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --ingress-gateway-type external
```


Use `kubectl get svc`

to check the service mapped to the ingress gateway:

```
kubectl get svc aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -n aks-istio-ingress
```


Observe from the output that the external IP address of the service is a publicly accessible one:

```
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
aks-istio-ingressgateway-external LoadBalancer 10.0.10.249 <EXTERNAL_IP> 15021:30705/TCP,80:32444/TCP,443:31728/TCP 4m21s
```


Applications aren't accessible from outside the cluster by default after enabling the ingress gateway. To make an application accessible, map the sample deployment's ingress to the Istio ingress gateway using the following manifest:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
name: bookinfo-gateway-external
spec:
selector:
istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-external
servers:
- port:
number: 80
name: http
protocol: HTTP
hosts:
- "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookinfo-vs-external
spec:
hosts:
- "*"
gateways:
- bookinfo-gateway-external
http:
- match:
- uri:
exact: /productpage
- uri:
prefix: /static
- uri:
exact: /login
- uri:
exact: /logout
- uri:
prefix: /api/v1/products
route:
- destination:
host: productpage
port:
number: 9080
EOF
```


Note

The selector used in the Gateway object points to `istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-external`

, which can be found as label on the service mapped to the external ingress that was enabled earlier.

Set environment variables for external ingress host and ports:

```
export INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].port}')
export GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL=$INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL:$INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL
```


Retrieve the external address of the sample application:

```
echo "http://$GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL/productpage"
```


Navigate to the URL from the output of the previous command and confirm that the sample application's product page is displayed. Alternatively, you can also use `curl`

to confirm the sample application is accessible. For example:

```
curl -s "http://${GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL}/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```


Confirm that the sample application's product page is accessible. The expected output is:

```
<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
```


## Enable internal ingress gateway

Use `az aks mesh enable-ingress-gateway`

to enable an internal Istio ingress on your AKS cluster:

```
az aks mesh enable-ingress-gateway --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --ingress-gateway-type internal
```


Use `kubectl get svc`

to check the service mapped to the ingress gateway:

```
kubectl get svc aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal -n aks-istio-ingress
```


Observe from the output that the external IP address of the service isn't a publicly accessible one and is instead only locally accessible:

```
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal LoadBalancer 10.0.182.240 <IP> 15021:30764/TCP,80:32186/TCP,443:31713/TCP 87s
```


After enabling the ingress gateway, applications need to be exposed through the gateway, and routing rules need to be configured accordingly. Use the following manifest to map the sample deployment's ingress to the Istio ingress gateway:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
name: bookinfo-internal-gateway
spec:
selector:
istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal
servers:
- port:
number: 80
name: http
protocol: HTTP
hosts:
- "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookinfo-vs-internal
spec:
hosts:
- "*"
gateways:
- bookinfo-internal-gateway
http:
- match:
- uri:
exact: /productpage
- uri:
prefix: /static
- uri:
exact: /login
- uri:
exact: /logout
- uri:
prefix: /api/v1/products
route:
- destination:
host: productpage
port:
number: 9080
EOF
```


Note

The selector used in the Gateway object points to `istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal`

, which can be found as label on the service mapped to the internal ingress that was enabled earlier.

Set environment variables for internal ingress host and ports:

```
export INGRESS_HOST_INTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export INGRESS_PORT_INTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].port}')
export GATEWAY_URL_INTERNAL=$INGRESS_HOST_INTERNAL:$INGRESS_PORT_INTERNAL
```


Retrieve the address of the sample application:

```
echo "http://$GATEWAY_URL_INTERNAL/productpage"
```


Navigate to the URL from the output of the previous command and confirm that the sample application's product page is **NOT** displayed. Alternatively, you can also use `curl`

to confirm the sample application is **NOT** accessible. For example:

```
curl -s "http://${GATEWAY_URL_INTERNAL}/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```


Use `kubectl exec`

to confirm application is accessible from inside the cluster's virtual network:

```
kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=ratings -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c ratings -- curl -sS "http://$GATEWAY_URL_INTERNAL/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```


Confirm that the sample application's product page is accessible. The expected output is:

```
<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
```


## Ingress gateway service customizations

### Annotations

The following annotations can be added to the Kubernetes service for the external and internal ingress gateways:

`external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname`

: for specifying the domain for resource's DNS records. For more information, see[external-dns](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/latest/docs/annotations/annotations/#external-dnsalphakubernetesiohostname).`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-allowed-ip-ranges`

: for specifying a list of allowed IP ranges separated by commas.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-allowed-service-tags`

: for specifying which[service tags](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview)the ingress gateway can receive requests from.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-disable-load-balancer-floating-ip`

: set to`true`

to disable floating IP address in load balancer rule.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet`

: name of subnet to bind internal ingress gateway to. This subnet must exist in the same virtual network as the mesh.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

: for configuring a static IPv4 address.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-disable-tcp-reset`

: for controlling whether Azure Load Balancer enables TCP Reset.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group`

: for specifying the resource group of a public IP in a different resource group from the cluster.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-tcp-idle-timeout`

: for configuring the TCP idle timeout in minutes for connections through the Azure Load Balancer.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-ip-tags`

: for specifying a list of IpTags separated by commas.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name`

: for specifying the name of a public IP address.`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-shared-securityrule`

: for exposing the ingress gateway through an[augmented security rule](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#augmented-security-rules).

The add-on supports health probe annotations for ports 80 and 443. Learn more about the usage of ports [here](/en-us/azure/aks/load-balancer-standard#customize-the-load-balancer-health-probe).

### External traffic policy

The add-on supports customization of `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy`

in the Kubernetes service for the ingress gateway. Setting `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy`

to `Local`

preserves the client source IP at the Istio ingress gateway and avoids a second hop in the traffic path to the backend ingress gateway pods.

```
kubectl patch service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -n aks-istio-ingress --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"externalTrafficPolicy": "Local"}}'
```


Note

Modifying the `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy`

to `Local`

risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. Before applying this change, it is recommended to read the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip) to understand the tradeoffs between the different `externalTrafficPolicy`

settings.

## Delete resources

If you want to clean up the Istio external or internal ingress gateways, but leave the mesh enabled on the cluster, run the following command:

```
az aks mesh disable-ingress-gateway --ingress-gateway-type <external/internal> --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


If you want to clean up the Istio service mesh and the ingresses (leaving behind the cluster), run the following command:

```
az aks mesh disable --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


If you want to clean up all the resources created from the Istio how-to guidance documents, run the following command:

```
az group delete --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --yes --no-wait
```

# Scheduler configuration concepts for workload placement in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article covers scheduler configuration and advanced scheduling concepts for workload placement in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including configurable scheduler profiles, scheduling plugins, and scheduling constraints.

## About the AKS scheduler

In AKS, the default mechanism of workload placement across nodes within a cluster is through the scheduler. The default scheduler is a control plane component responsible for assigning AKS deployment pods to nodes. Once the AKS scheduler selects a node, the deployment pod is bound to it, and the rest of the lifecycle continues.

When a pod is created without a specified node, the scheduler selects an optimal node based on several criteria, including (but not limited to):

- Available resources (CPU, memory)
[Node affinity/anti-affinity](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)[Pod affinity/anti-affinity](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity)[Taints and tolerations](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations)

### AKS scheduler configuration and scheduling strategies

By default, the AKS scheduler comes with a set of built-in rules that work well for general-purpose workloads. However, advanced use cases might require custom scheduling strategies. For example:

- Batch jobs might prefer collocating in a few nodes (for better performance) over topology-aware spreading (for reliability).
- Cost-sensitive workloads might benefit from node binpacking to consolidate jobs and minimize idle compute node costs.

To support these use cases, AKS allows you to set one or more in-tree scheduling plugins through a Kubernetes custom resource (CRD) to configure the scheduling behavior on your AKS cluster.

## Configurable scheduler profiles

A scheduler profile is a set of one or more in-tree scheduling plugins and configurations that dictate how to schedule a pod. Previously, AKS managed the scheduler configuration, and it wasn't accessible to users. Starting from Kubernetes version `1.33`

, you can now configure and set a scheduler profile (preview) for the Kubernetes scheduler on your cluster.

Each scheduler profile has the following components:

- A unique name.
- A set of
[scheduling plugins](#supported-in-tree-scheduling-plugins). - Custom arguments for fine-grained behavior (applicable to certain plugins).

## Supported in-tree scheduling plugins

AKS supports configuration of 18 in-tree Kubernetes scheduling plugins that allow pods to be placed on specific nodes, ensure pods are matched with specific storage resources, optimize for nodes with container images, and more.

The following sections walk you through these plugins, which are grouped into the following categories:

[Scheduling constraints and order-based plugins](#scheduling-constraints-and-order-based-plugins)[Node selection constraints scheduling plugins](#node-selection-constraints-scheduling-plugins)[Resource and topology optimization scheduling plugins](#resource-and-topology-optimization-scheduling-plugins)

To learn more about these plugins and configuration options, see the [Kubernetes Scheduling Plugin documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#scheduling-plugins).

### Scheduling constraints and order-based plugins

`DefaultBinder`

: Responsible for binding the pod to a node after the scheduler selects a suitable node. Once the node is selected, the`DefaultBinder`

creates a binding object to ensure the pod is scheduled onto that node.`DefaultPreemption`

: Handles preemption, which is the process of evicting lower-priority pods to make room for higher-priority pods. If a pod can't be scheduled because there aren’t enough resources on the node, this plugin preempts other pods to make space. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`PodPriority`

: Defines the priority of the pod being scheduled.`PreemptionPolicy`

: The policy for handling pod preemption (for example:`"PreemptLowerPriority"`

or`"DoNotPreempt"`

).`PodPriorityClass`

: The priority class associated with the pod.`PodInfo`

: Information about the pods that are candidates for preemption.`Node`

: Information about the node on which preemption is considered.

`SchedulingGates`

: Introduces the concept of scheduling gates, which are conditions that must be satisfied before a pod is scheduled. For example, it can enforce the completion of certain tasks or operations before the scheduler attempts to schedule a pod.`PrioritySort`

: Sorts the list of pods according to their priority class. Pods with higher priority are scheduled first. It helps with the preemption decision-making and determines which pods to consider for priority scheduling.

### Node selection constraints scheduling plugins

`InterPodAffinity`

: Takes into account*affinity*rules specified by the user that influences scheduling based on the proximity of other pods. If a pod has affinity rules, it tries to schedule the pod on the same node or in the same topology as other pods that it has an affinity for (for example: for performance reasons or tight coupling). This plugin can receive the following arguments:`Affinity`

: Defines required or preferred affinity rules for the pod, which specifies other pods that the pod should or shouldn't be scheduled nearby.`TopologyKey`

: The key representing the failure domain to which the affinity rule applies (for example:`"kubernetes.io/hostname"`

for node-level affinity or`"topology.kubernetes.io/zone"`

for zone-level).`Weight`

: Defines how strongly the scheduler should consider a specific affinity rule.`Pod`

: The pod being scheduled.`OtherPods`

: List of other pods to consider in relation to the affinity rules.

`NodeAffinity`

: Enables scheduling based on node labels. It allows users to specify rules for which nodes a pod can be scheduled on based on the node's labels and provides fine-grained control over pod placement on nodes. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`NodeAffinity`

: Defines the required or preferred node affinity rules, such as`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

or`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

.`NodeSelectorTerms`

: Defines the set of node labels and values that must match.`Pod`

: The pod being scheduled.`Node`

: A potential node for scheduling.`LabelSelector`

: A selector for choosing nodes based on labels.

`NodeName`

: Forces pods to be scheduled on a specific node. When you specify the exact node name, the scheduler places the pod on that node if possible.`NodePorts`

: Ensures that a pod with a service of type`NodePort`

can be scheduled on a node that has the required ports available for binding. It checks whether the node has enough resources to support the node port allocations for the service.`NodeUnschedulable`

: Ensures that pods aren't scheduled on nodes marked as*unschedulable*. If a node is tainted with`node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable`

, the scheduler doesn't place any new pods on that node.`TaintToleration`

: Checks if a pod has the required tolerations to be scheduled on a node that has taints. Taints on nodes prevent pods from being scheduled unless the pod has a matching toleration.`NodeVolumeLimits`

: Checks whether a node has exceeded its volume limit. Each node has a maximum number of volumes it can attach, and this plugin ensures that the pod isn't scheduled on a node that has already reached that supported limit.`VolumeBinding`

: Ensures that persistent volumes (PVs) are properly bound to pods. It checks whether the volume that a pod requires can be bound to a node and ensures the volume is available on the selected node. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`VolumeClaims`

: The persistent volume claims (PVCs) made by the pod being scheduled.`Node`

: The candidate node being considered for scheduling.`VolumeAvailable`

: Checks if the persistent volume is available on the node or within the appropriate zone.`Pod`

: The pod that is requesting volume binding.`StorageClass`

: The storage class associated with the persistent volume.`VolumeBindingMode`

: Defines whether the volume binding mode is`Immediate`

or`WaitForFirstConsumer`

(for delayed binding until a pod is scheduled).

`VolumeRestrictions`

: Ensures that volume restrictions (such as limitations on the number of volumes a node can have attached) are respected when scheduling a pod. It prevents scheduling a pod on a node where the volume restrictions would be violated.`VolumeZone`

: Ensures that volumes are scheduled in the same availability zone as the pod. For example, if a pod requests a volume that must be in a specific zone, the plugin ensures that both the pod and the volume are in the same zone.

### Resource and topology optimization scheduling plugins

`NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation`

: Aims to balance the resource allocation on nodes. When scheduling a pod, it considers how resources like CPU and memory are allocated across nodes to avoid overprovisioning or underutilizing resources. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`ResourceRequests`

: The resource requests (CPU, memory, etc.) of the pod being scheduled.`Node`

: A candidate node for scheduling.`NodeResources`

: The available resources (CPU, memory, etc.) of the node.`ClusterResourceUsage`

: Cluster-wide resource usage metrics to help decide the best node to balance resources.

`NodeResourcesFit`

: Checks whether a node has enough available resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run the pod. It ensures that a pod is only scheduled on a node that has sufficient resources available. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`ResourceRequests`

: The resource requests of the pod.`Node`

: The candidate node being considered for scheduling.`NodeCapacity`

: The available capacity of resources on the node.`Pod`

: The pod being scheduled, with its resource requests.

`ImageLocality`

: Helps the scheduler decide whether to schedule a pod onto a node based on the presence of a required container image. It tries to schedule pods on nodes where the required image is already present, reducing the time needed to pull the image.`PodTopologySpread`

: Ensures that pods are spread evenly across the topology (like zones or regions) to achieve high availability and fault tolerance. It tries to avoid placing multiple replicas of a pod in the same failure domain. This plugin can receive the following arguments:`TopologySpreadConstraints`

: Defines the constraints for how pods should be spread across failure domains, including the key (for example:`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`

) and the number of pods to be placed in each domain.`Pod`

: The pod being scheduled.`FailureDomain`

: The failure domain key (for example: zone or region).`PodAffinity`

: Information about pod affinity, which could also impact how the pods are distributed.`Node`

: Potential nodes for placement.`PodSpreadScore`

: Used to determine how much "spread" the pod should have across domains (higher scores indicate better spreading).
