# Manually scale the node count in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

If the resource needs of your applications change, your cluster performance may be impacted due to low capacity on CPU, memory, PID space, or disk sizes. To address these changes, you can manually scale your AKS cluster to run a different number of nodes. When you scale in, nodes are carefully [cordoned and drained](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/) to minimize disruption to running applications. When you scale out, AKS waits until nodes are marked **Ready** by the Kubernetes cluster before pods are scheduled on them.

This article describes how to manually increase or decrease the number of nodes in an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

Review the

[AKS service quotas and limits](quotas-skus-regions#service-quotas-and-limits)to verify your cluster can scale to your desired number of nodes.The name of a node pool may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-11 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.


## Scale the cluster nodes

Important

Removing nodes from a node pool using the kubectl command isn't supported. Doing so can create scaling issues with your AKS cluster.

Get the

*name*of your node pool using thecommand. The following example gets the node pool name for the cluster named`az aks show`

*myAKSCluster*in the*myResourceGroup*resource group:`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query agentPoolProfiles`

The following example output shows that the

*name*is*nodepool1*:`[ { "count": 1, "maxPods": 110, "name": "nodepool1", "osDiskSizeGb": 30, "osType": "Linux", "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2" } ]`

Scale the cluster nodes using the

command. The following example scales a cluster named`az aks scale`

*myAKSCluster*to a single node. Provide your own`--nodepool-name`

from the previous command, such as*nodepool1*:`az aks scale --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --nodepool-name <your node pool name>`

The following example output shows the cluster successfully scaled to one node, as shown in the

*agentPoolProfiles*section:`{ "aadProfile": null, "addonProfiles": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": 1, "maxPods": 110, "name": "nodepool1", "osDiskSizeGb": 30, "osType": "Linux", "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", "vnetSubnetId": null } ], [...] }`


## Scale `User`

node pools to 0

Unlike `System`

node pools that always require running nodes, `User`

node pools allow you to scale to 0. To learn more on the differences between system and user node pools, see [System and user node pools](use-system-pools).

Important

You can't scale a user node pool with the cluster autoscaler enabled to 0 nodes. To scale a user node pool to 0 nodes, you must disable the cluster autoscaler first. For more information, see [Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool](cluster-autoscaler#disable-the-cluster-autoscaler-on-a-node-pool).

To scale a user pool to 0, you can use the

[az aks nodepool scale](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-scale)in alternative to the above`az aks scale`

command, and set`0`

as your node count.`az aks nodepool scale --name <your node pool name> --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-count 0`

You can also autoscale

`User`

node pools to zero nodes, by setting the`--min-count`

parameter of the[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to`0`

.

## Next steps

In this article, you manually scaled an AKS cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes. You can also use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler) to automatically scale your cluster.

# Azure Linux with OS Guard (preview) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of Azure Linux with OS Guard (preview) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including key features, region availability, and resources to get started.

## What is Azure Linux with OS Guard?

Azure Linux with OS Guard is a hardened, immutable variant of Azure Linux. It provides strong runtime integrity, tamper resistance, and enterprise-grade security for container hosts on AKS. OS Guard is built on Azure Linux and adds kernel and runtime features that enforce code integrity, protect the root file system from unauthorized changes, and apply mandatory access controls.

You can deploy Azure Linux with OS Guard node pools in a new cluster, add Azure Linux with OS Guard node pools to your existing Azure Linux or Ubuntu clusters, or migrate your Azure Linux or Ubuntu nodes to Azure Linux with OS Guard nodes.

To learn more about Azure Linux with OS Guard, see the [Azure Linux with OS Guard documentation](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Why use Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS?

Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS builds on the benefits of [Azure Linux](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux#azure-linux-container-host-key-benefits) by adding enhanced security features that help protect your container workloads from advanced threats. OS Guard provides:

**Immutability**: The`/usr`

directory is mounted as a read-only volume protected by dm-verity, preventing execution of tampered or untrusted code.**Code integrity**: OS Guard integrates the[Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE) Linux Security Module](https://docs.kernel.org/next/admin-guide/LSM/ipe.html)to ensure that only binaries from trusted, signed volumes are allowed to execute. (**IPE is running in audit mode during Public Preview**.)**Mandatory access controls**: OS Guard integrates SELinux to limit which processes can access sensitive resources in the system. (**SELinux is operating in permissive mode during Public Preview**.)**Integration with Azure security features**: Native support for[Trusted Launch](/en-us/azure/aks/use-trusted-launch)and Secure Boot provides measured boot protections and attestation.**Verified container layers**: Container images and layers are validated using signed dm-verity hashes. This ensures that only verified layers are used at runtime, reducing the risk of container escape or tampering.**Sovereign Supply Chain Security**: OS Guard inherits Azure Linux’s secure build pipelines, signed Unified Kernel Images (UKIs) and Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs).

Learn more about the [key features of Azure Linux with OS Guard](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Regional availability

Azure Linux with OS Guard is available for use in the same [regions](/en-us/azure/aks/quotas-skus-regions) as AKS.

## Get started with Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS

Get started with Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS using the following resources:
