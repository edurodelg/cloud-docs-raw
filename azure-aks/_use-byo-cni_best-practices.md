Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes doesn't provide a network interface system by default. Instead, [network plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) provide this functionality. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides several supported Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. For information on supported plugins, see [Networking concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-network).

The supported plugins meet most networking needs in Kubernetes. However, advanced AKS users might want the same CNI plugin that they used in on-premises Kubernetes environments. Or these users might want to use advanced functionalities available in other CNI plugins.

This article shows how to deploy an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled. From there, you can install any CNI plugin that works in Azure.

## Support

Microsoft support can't assist with CNI-related issues in clusters that you deploy by bringing your own CNI plugin. For example, CNI-related issues would cover most east/west (pod to pod) traffic, along with `kubectl proxy`

and similar commands. If you want CNI-related support, use a supported AKS network plugin or seek support from the CNI plugin vendor.

Microsoft still provides support for issues that aren't related to CNI.

## Prerequisites

- For Azure Resource Manager or Bicep, use at least template version 2022-01-02-preview or 2022-06-01.
- For the Azure CLI, use at least version 2.39.0.
- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the address range for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual network. - The cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet or modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node's Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups). - AKS doesn't create a route table in the managed virtual network.
- You must specify a Pod CIDR (IP address range for pods). The AKS control plane uses this range for internal traffic routing to pods, even though pod IP assignment will be managed by your custom CNI. If no pod CIDR is provided, control plane to pod communication may fail or be misrouted. You must select a pod CIDR that does not conflict with any other network in your environment and avoids Azure reserved ranges, such as,
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

. For example, you might use a range such as`10.XX.0.0/16`

that is unique to your cluster. This ensures that the control plane can route directly to pod IPs on your nodes, and no IP overlap will occur if you integrate with other networks or clusters.

## Create an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled

Create an Azure resource group for your AKS cluster by using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location eastus --name myResourceGroup`

Create an AKS cluster by using the

command. Pass the`az aks create`

`--network-plugin`

parameter with the parameter value of`none`

.`az aks create \ --location eastus \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --network-plugin none \ --pod-cidr "10.10.0.0/16" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Deploy a CNI plugin

After AKS provisioning finishes, the cluster is online. But all the nodes are in a `NotReady`

state, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 NotReady agent 6m9s v1.21.9
$ kubectl get node -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].message'
NAME STATUS
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```


At this point, the cluster is ready for installation of a CNI plugin.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Building and running applications successfully in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) requires understanding and implementation of some key concepts, including:

- Multi-tenancy and scheduler features.
- Cluster and pod security.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery.

The AKS product group, engineering teams, and field teams (including global black belts (GBBs)) contributed to, wrote, and grouped the following best practices and conceptual articles. Their purpose is to help cluster operators and developers better understand the concepts above and implement the appropriate features.

## Cluster operator best practices

If you're a cluster operator, work with application owners and developers to understand their needs. Then, you can use the following best practices to configure your AKS clusters to fit your needs.

An important practice that you should include as part of your application development and deployment process is remembering to follow commonly used deployment and testing patterns. Testing your application before deployment is an important step to ensure its quality, functionality, and compatibility with the target environment. It can help you identify and fix any errors, bugs, or issues that might affect the performance, security, or usability of the application or underlying infrastructure.

### Multi-tenancy

[Best practices for cluster isolation](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation)- Includes multi-tenancy core components and logical isolation with namespaces.

[Best practices for basic scheduler features](operator-best-practices-scheduler)- Includes using resource quotas and pod disruption budgets.

[Best practices for advanced scheduler features](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler)- Includes using taints and tolerations, node selectors and affinity, and inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity.

[Best practices for authentication and authorization](operator-best-practices-identity)- Includes integration with Microsoft Entra ID, using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC), using Azure RBAC, and pod identities.


### Security

[Best practices for cluster security and upgrades](operator-best-practices-cluster-security)- Includes securing access to the API server, limiting container access, and managing upgrades and node reboots.

[Best practices for container image management and security](operator-best-practices-container-image-management)- Includes securing the image and runtimes and automated builds on base image updates.

[Best practices for pod security](developer-best-practices-pod-security)- Includes securing access to resources, limiting credential exposure, and using pod identities and digital key vaults.


### Network and storage

[Best practices for network connectivity](operator-best-practices-network)- Includes different network models, using ingress and web application firewalls (WAF), and securing node SSH access.

[Best practices for storage and backups](operator-best-practices-storage)- Includes choosing the appropriate storage type and node size, dynamically provisioning volumes, and data backups.


### Running enterprise-ready workloads

[Best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery](operator-best-practices-multi-region)- Includes using region pairs, multiple clusters with Azure Traffic Manager, and geo-replication of container images.


## Developer best practices

If you're a developer or application owner, you can simplify your development experience and define required application performance features.

[Best practices for application developers to manage resources](developer-best-practices-resource-management)- Includes defining pod resource requests and limits, configuring development tools, and checking for application issues.

[Best practices for pod security](developer-best-practices-pod-security)- Includes securing access to resources, limiting credential exposure, and using pod identities and digital key vaults.

[Best practices for deployment and cluster reliability](best-practices-app-cluster-reliability)- Includes deployment, cluster, and node pool level best practices.
