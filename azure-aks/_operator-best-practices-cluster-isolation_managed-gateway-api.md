As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. AKS allows flexibility in how you run multi-tenant clusters and isolate resources. To maximize your investment in Kubernetes, it's important you understand AKS multi-tenancy and isolation features.

This best practices article focuses on isolation for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Plan for multi-tenant clusters and separation of resources.
- Use logical or physical isolation in your AKS clusters.

## Design clusters for multi-tenancy

Kubernetes lets you logically isolate teams and workloads in the same cluster. The goal is to provide the least number of privileges scoped to the resources each team needs. A Kubernetes [Namespace](concepts-clusters-workloads#namespaces) creates a logical isolation boundary. Other Kubernetes features and considerations for isolation and multi-tenancy include the following areas:

### Scheduling

*Scheduling* uses basic features like resource quotas and pod disruption budgets. For more information about these features, see [Best practices for basic scheduler features in AKS](operator-best-practices-scheduler).

More advanced scheduler features include:

- Taints and tolerations.
- Node selectors.
- Node and pod affinity or anti-affinity.

For more information about these features, see [Best practices for advanced scheduler features in AKS](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler).

### Networking

*Networking* uses network policies to control the flow of traffic in and out of pods.

For more information, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).

### Authentication and authorization

*Authentication and authorization* uses:

- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Microsoft Entra integration.
- Pod identities.
- Secrets in Azure Key Vault.

For more information about these features, see [Best practices for authentication and authorization in AKS](operator-best-practices-identity).

### Containers

*Containers* include:

- The Azure Policy add-on for AKS to enforce pod security.
- Pod security admission.
- Scanning images and runtime for vulnerabilities.
- Using App Armor or Seccomp (Secure Computing) to restrict container access to the underlying node.

## Logically isolated clusters


Best practice guidanceSeparate teams and projects using

logical isolation. Minimize the number of physical AKS clusters you deploy to isolate teams or applications.

With logical isolation, you can use a single AKS cluster for multiple workloads, teams, or environments. Kubernetes [Namespaces](concepts-clusters-workloads#namespaces) form the logical isolation boundary for workloads and resources.

Logical separation of clusters usually provides a higher pod density than physically isolated clusters, with less excess compute capacity sitting idle in the cluster. When combined with the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler, you can scale the number of nodes up or down to meet demands. This best practice approach minimizes costs by running only the required number of nodes.

Kubernetes environments aren't entirely safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. In a multi-tenant environment, multiple tenants work on a shared infrastructure. If all tenants can't be trusted, you need extra planning to prevent tenants from impacting the security and service of others.

Other security features, like Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster and not an individual node.

For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters.

## Physically isolated clusters


Best practice guidanceMinimize the use of physical isolation for each separate team or application deployment and use

logicalisolation instead.

Physically separating AKS clusters is a common approach to cluster isolation. In this isolation model, teams or workloads are assigned their own AKS cluster. While physical isolation might look like the easiest way to isolate workloads or teams, it adds management and financial overhead. With physically isolated clusters, you must maintain multiple clusters and individually provide access and assign permissions. You're also billed for each individual node.

Physically isolated clusters usually have a low pod density. Since each team or workload has their own AKS cluster, the cluster is often over-provisioned with compute resources. Often, a few pods are scheduled on those nodes. Unclaimed node capacity can't be used for applications or services in development by other teams. These excess resources contribute to the extra costs in physically isolated clusters.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

The [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is a specification for traffic management on Kubernetes clusters. It was designed as a successor and enhancement of the [Ingress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), which lacked a unified and provider-agnostic approach for advanced traffic routing.

The Managed Gateway API Installation for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) installs the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for the Kubernetes Gateway API. With the Managed Gateway API installation, you can use Gateway API functionality in a fully supported mode on AKS. However, you must also use an AKS add-on or extension that implements the Gateway API, such as [the Istio add-on](istio-gateway-api).

## Gateway API bundle version and AKS Kubernetes version mapping

The following table outlines the supported Kubernetes versions for your AKS cluster for each Gateway API bundle version for the `standard`

channel. `Experimental`

channel CRDs are disallowed and must be uninstalled before enabling the Managed Gateway API installation.

| Gateway API Bundle Version | Supported Kubernetes Versions |
|---|---|
| v1.2.1 | v1.26.0 - v1.33.x |
| v1.3.0 | v1.34.0+ |

Note

If you upgrade your AKS cluster to a new minor version after installing the Managed Gateway API CRDs, the CRDs will automatically be upgraded to the new supported Gateway API bundle version for that Kubernetes version. For instance, if you upgrade from AKS `v1.33.0`

to `v1.34.0`

and previously had the Managed Gateway API installed for bundle version `v1.2.1`

, the CRDs are automatically upgraded to bundle version `v1.3.0`

.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have at least one of the following implementations of the Gateway API installed and enabled on your cluster:

[Istio add-on](istio-deploy-addon)minor revision`asm-1-26`

or higher.- If you already have an existing installation of the Gateway API CRDs on your cluster, then you must only have
`standard`

channel CRDs installed, and the Gateway API bundle version must be compatible with your cluster's Kubernetes version. See the table for the[bundle version associated with each Kubernetes version](#gateway-api-bundle-version-and-aks-kubernetes-version-mapping).

- If you already have an existing installation of the Gateway API CRDs on your cluster, then you must only have
Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using thecommand if you're using Azure CLI. You must use`az extension add`

`aks-preview`

version`19.0.0b4`

or higher.`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command:`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Manage the Managed Gateway API preview feature

You can register the `ManagedGatewayAPIPreview`

feature flag by using the [ az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command:

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "ManagedGatewayAPIPreview"
```


Then you can install or uninstall the Managed Gateway API CRDs.

You can run the

`az aks create`

command to install the Managed Gateway API CRDs on a newly created cluster. You must also enable an implementation of the Gateway API to enable the managed CRD installation.`# Example: enable the managed Gateway API installation with the Istio service mesh add-on az aks create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-gateway-api --enable-azure-service-mesh`

To install the Managed Gateway API CRDs on an existing cluster with a supported implementation enabled, run the following command:

`az aks update -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-gateway-api`

To view the CRDs installed on your cluster, run the following command:

`kubectl get crds | grep "gateway.networking.k8s.io"`

`gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z grpcroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:37Z referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:37Z`

Verify that the CRDs have the expected annotations and that the bundle version matches the

[expected Kubernetes version](#gateway-api-bundle-version-and-aks-kubernetes-version-mapping)for your cluster.`kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io -ojsonpath={.metadata.annotations} | jq`

`{ "api-approved.kubernetes.io": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3328", "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by": "aks", "app.kubernetes.io/part-of": <hash>, "gateway.networking.k8s.io/bundle-version": "v1.2.1", "gateway.networking.k8s.io/channel": "standard" }`
