Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As your workload demands change, you can associate existing [capacity reservation groups (CRGs)](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-associate-virtual-machine-scale-set) to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools to guarantee allocated capacity for them. Capacity reservation groups allow you to reserve compute capacity in an Azure region or availability zone for any duration of time. This feature is useful for workloads that require guaranteed capacity, such as those with predictable traffic patterns or those that need to meet specific performance requirements.

In this article, you learn how to use capacity reservation groups with node pools in AKS.

Note

Deleting a node pool implicitly dissociates that node pool from any associated capacity reservation group before the node pool is deleted. Deleting a cluster implicitly dissociates all node pools in that cluster from their associated capacity reservation groups.

## Prerequisites for using capacity reservation groups with AKS node pools

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.56 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need an existing
[capacity reservation group](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-associate-virtual-machine-scale-set)with at least one capacity reservation. If not, the node pool is added to the cluster with a warning and no capacity reservation group gets associated. - You need to
[create a user-assigned managed identity with the](#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-and-assign-it-to-an-aks-cluster)for the resource group that contains the capacity reservation group and assign the identity to your AKS cluster. System-assigned managed identities don't work for this feature.`Contributor`

role

### Create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to an AKS cluster

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name <identity-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --location <location>`

Get the ID of the user-assigned managed identity using the

command and set it to an environment variable.`az identity show`

`IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity show --name <identity-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query identity.id -o tsv)`

Assign the

`Contributor`

role to the user-assigned identity using thecommand.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --assignee $IDENTITY_ID --role "Contributor" --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>`

It can take up to

*60 minutes*for the role assignment to propagate.Assign the user-assigned managed identity to a new or existing AKS cluster using the

`--assign-identity`

flag with theor`az aks create`

command.`az aks update`

`# Create a new AKS cluster with the user-assigned managed identity az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --location <location> \ --node-vm-size <vm-size> --node-count <node-count> \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys # Update an existing AKS cluster to use the user-assigned managed identity az aks update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --location <location> \ --node-vm-size <vm-size> \ --node-count <node-count> \ --enable-managed-identity \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID`


## Limitations for using capacity reservation groups with AKS node pools

You can't update an existing node pool with a capacity reservation group. Instead, you need to create a new node pool with the `--crg-id`

flag to associate it with the capacity reservation group. You can also associate an existing capacity reservation group with a system node pool during cluster creation.

## Get the ID of an existing capacity reservation group

Get the ID of an existing capacity reservation group using the

command and set it to an environment variable.`az capacity reservation group show`

`CRG_ID=$(az capacity reservation group show --capacity-reservation-group <crg-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --query id -o tsv)`


## Associate an existing capacity reservation group with a node pool

Associate an existing capacity reservation group with a node pool using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--crg-id`

flag. The following example assumes you have a CRG named "myCRG".`az aks nodepool add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --name <node-pool-name> --crg-id $CRG_ID`


## Associate an existing capacity reservation group with a system node pool

To associate an existing capacity reservation group with a system node pool, you need to assign the user-assigned managed identity with the `Contributor`

role to the cluster during cluster creation. You can then use the `--crg-id`

flag to associate the capacity reservation group with the system node pool.

Create a new AKS cluster with the user-assigned managed identity and associate it with the capacity reservation group using the

`--assign-identity`

and`--crg-id`

flags with thecommand.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --location <location> \ --node-vm-size <vm-size> --node-count <node-count> \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --crg-id $CRG_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy and manage a Kubernetes application from Azure Marketplace.

[Azure Marketplace](/en-us/marketplace/azure-marketplace-overview) is an online store that contains thousands of IT software applications and services built by industry-leading technology companies. In Azure Marketplace, you can find, try, buy, and deploy the software and services that you need to build new solutions and manage your cloud infrastructure. The catalog includes solutions for different industries and technical areas, free trials, and consulting services from Microsoft partners.

## Limitations

- This feature is currently supported only in the following regions:
- Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Canada East, Central India, Central US, East Asia, East US, East US 2, East US 2 EAUP, France Central, France South, Germany North, Germany West Central, Japan East, Japan West, Jio India West, Korea Central, Korea South, North Central Us, North Europe, Norway East, Norway West, South Africa North, South Central US, South India, Southeast Asia, Sweden Central, Switzerland North, UAE North, UK South, UK West, West Central US, West Europe, West US, West US 2, West US 3

- You can't deploy Kubernetes application-based container offers on AKS for Azure Stack HCI or AKS Edge Essentials.

## Select and deploy a Kubernetes application

### From an AKS cluster

In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.

From the service menu, under

**Settings**, select**Extensions + applications**>**Add**.You can search for an offer or publisher directly by name, or you can browse all offers. To view Kubernetes application offers, select

**Containers**under**Categories**.After you decide on an application, select the offer. The following example uses the

**TrilioVault for Kubernetes - BYOL**offer.Select

**Plans + Pricing**to ensure the terms are acceptable, and then select**Create**.Follow each page in the application creation process, filling in information for your resource group, your cluster, and any configuration options that the application requires. You can decide to deploy on a new AKS cluster or use an existing cluster.

Once you've filled in all the required information, select

**Review + create**>**Create**.It might take a few minutes for the application to deploy. You can monitor the deployment status from the

**Extensions + applications**page.

### Search in the Azure portal

From the Azure portal home page, search for and select

**Marketplace**.You can search for an offer or publisher directly by name, or you can browse all offers. To find Kubernetes application offers, on the left side under

**Categories**select**Containers**.After you decide on an application, select the offer. The following example uses the

**TrilioVault for Kubernetes - BYOL**offer.Select

**Plans + Pricing**to ensure the terms are acceptable, and then select**Create**.Follow each page in the application creation process, filling in information for your resource group, your cluster, and any configuration options that the application requires. You can decide to deploy on a new AKS cluster or use an existing cluster.

Once you've filled in all the required information, select

**Review + create**>**Create**.It might take a few minutes for the application to deploy. You can monitor the deployment status from the

**Extensions + applications**page.

## Verify the deployment

- Navigate to the cluster where you recently installed the application.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Extensions + applications**. - Verify that the extension is listed and the
*Provisioning State*shows**Succeeded**.

## Manage the offer lifecycle

For lifecycle management, a Kubernetes offer is represented as a cluster extension for AKS. For more information, see [Cluster extensions for AKS](cluster-extensions). Purchasing an offer from Azure Marketplace creates a new instance of the extension on your AKS cluster.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to the cluster where you recently installed the application.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Extensions + applications**. - Select an extension name to navigate to a properties view where you're able to disable autoupgrades, check the provisioning state, delete the extension instance, or modify configuration settings as needed.

## Monitor billing and usage information

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster's resource group.
- From the service menu, under
**Cost Management**, select**Cost analysis**. Under**Product**, you can see a cost breakdown for the plan that you selected.

## Remove an offer

You can delete a purchased plan for an Azure container offer by deleting the extension instance on the cluster.

- Navigate to the cluster where you recently installed the application.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Extensions + applications**. - Select an application, then select
**Uninstall**.
