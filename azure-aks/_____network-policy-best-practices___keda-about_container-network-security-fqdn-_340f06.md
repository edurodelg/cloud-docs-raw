Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes, by default, operates as a flat network where all pods can communicate freely with each other. This unrestricted connectivity can be convenient for developers but poses significant security risks as applications scale. Imagine an organization deploying multiple microservices, each handling sensitive data, customer transactions, or backend operations. Without any restrictions, any compromised pod could potentially access unauthorized data or disrupt services.

To address these security concerns, [Network Policies in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow administrators to control and restrict traffic between workloads. They provide a declarative way to enforce traffic rules, ensuring secure and controlled network behavior within a cluster.

## What is Kubernetes Network Policy?

A Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that control how pods communicate with each other and with external services. It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, allowing administrators to enforce security and segmentation at the namespace level. By implementing Network Policies, you gain:

**Stronger security posture**: Prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the cluster.**Compliance and governance**: Enforce regulatory requirements by controlling communication pathways.**Reduced blast radius**: Limit the impact of a compromised workload by restricting its network access.

Initially, Network Policies were designed to operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model, enabling basic control over pod-to-pod and external communications. However, advanced network policy engines like Cilium have extended Network Policies to Layer 7 (Application Layer), allowing deeper control over application traffic for modern cloud-native applications.

Network Policies are defined at the namespace level, meaning each policy applies to workloads within a specific namespace. The main components of a Network Policy include:

**Pod selector**: Defines which pods the policy applies to based on labels.**Ingress rules**: Specify the allowed incoming connections.**Egress rules**: Specify the allowed outgoing connections.**Policy types**: Define whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming), egress (outgoing), or both.

## Foundations of building effective network policies

Building effective network policies in Kubernetes isn't just about writing YAML configurations—it requires a deep understanding of your application architecture, traffic patterns, and security requirements. Without a clear picture of how workloads communicate, enforcing security policies can lead to unintended disruptions or gaps in protection. The following sections cover how to systematically approach network policy design.

### Understanding your workload connectivity

Before implementing network policies, you need visibility into how workloads communicate with each other and external services. This step ensures that policies don’t inadvertently block critical traffic while effectively limiting unnecessary exposure.

**Leverage Visibility Tools:**in addition to the network requirements provided by application team you can use tools like[Cilium Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble), and[Retina](https://retina.sh/)help you analyze pod-to-pod traffic, identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database. Identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database.**The importance of labels in network policies:**Traditionally, network security policies have relied on static IP addresses to define traffic rules. This approach is problematic in Kubernetes because pods are ephemeral—created and destroyed frequently, often with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Maintaining security rules based on constantly changing IPs would require continuous updates, making policy management inefficient and error-prone.

Labels solve this challenge by providing a stable way to group workloads. Instead of relying on fixed IPs, Kubernetes Network Policies use labels to define security rules that remain consistent even as pods restart or shift across nodes. For example, a policy can allow communication between pods labeled `app: frontend`

and `app: backend`

, ensuring traffic flows as intended regardless of pod IP changes. This label-based approach is critical for achieving scalable, intent-driven network security in cloud-native environments.

A well-defined labeling strategy simplifies policy management, reduces misconfigurations, and enhances security enforcement across clusters.

**Define Micro-segmentation:**Organizing workloads into security zones (e.g., frontend, backend, database) helps enforce the principle of least privilege. For instance, microservices handling customer transactions should be isolated from general-purpose applications.

### Layered security approach for Kubernetes

Relying solely on basic Kubernetes Network Policies might not be sufficient for all security needs. A layered approach ensures comprehensive protection across different levels of network communication.

**(L3/L4) policies**: The foundation of network security, controlling traffic based on pod labels and namespaces at the IP, port, and protocol level.**FQDN-based policies**: Restrict egress traffic to specific external domains, ensuring workloads can only reach approved external services (for example: only allowing access to*microsoft.com*for API calls).**Layer 7 policies**: Introduces fine-grained control over traffic by filtering requests based on HTTP methods, headers, and paths. This is useful for securing APIs and enforcing application-layer security policies.

### Management of Network Policies

Who should manage network policies? This often depends on an organization’s structure and security requirements. A well-balanced approach allows both security teams and application developers to collaborate effectively.

**Centralized security administration**: Security or networking teams should define baseline policies to enforce global security requirements, such as default deny-all rules or compliance-driven restrictions.**Developer autonomy with guardrails**: Application teams should be able to define service-specific network policies within their namespaces, enabling security while maintaining agility.**Policy lifecycle management**: Regularly reviewing and updating policies ensures that security remains aligned with evolving application architectures. Observability tools can help detect policy misconfigurations and missing rules.

#### Example: Securing a multi-tier web application with Network Policies

**Step 1: Understanding workload connectivity**

- Visibility tools: Use Cilium Hubble to observe how pods communicate.


Mapping connectivity:

Source Destination Protocol Port Frontend Backend TCP 8080 Backend Database TCP 5432 Backend External Payment Gateway TCP 443

**Step 2: Applying labels for policy enforcement**

By labeling workloads correctly, policies can remain stable even if pod IPs change.

`app: frontend`

for UI pods.`app: backend`

for API pods.`app: database`

for DB pods.

**Step 3: Implementing application-level Network Policies**

In this example, we use two layers of network policies: an L3/L4 basic policy to control traffic between microservices and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) policy to control egress traffic with external payment gateway.

| Allow frontend to communicate with backend | Allow backend to access the database | Allow backend to reach external payment API |
|---|---|---|
Policy 1: Frontend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` Policy 2: Backend ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: frontend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` |
Policy 1: Backend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: database` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` Policy 2: Database ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` |
Policy 1: Backend`spec:` ` endpointSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` egress:` ` - toFQDNs:` ` - matchName: payments.example.com` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 443` |

**Step 4: Managing and maintaining policies**

Security and platform teams enforce baseline deny rules.

Baseline policy Platform policy Security - Default deny all traffic - Allow DNS

- Allow Logs- Block traffic

to known

malicious IPs

and domainsEnsuring that the application's network policies comply with platform and security requirements while avoiding any policy violations.

## Azure Powered by Cilium

[Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security for Kubernetes workloads. Unlike traditional CNIs that rely on iptables-based packet filtering, Azure CNI powered by Cilium uses eBPF to operate at the kernel level, enabling efficient and scalable network policy enforcement. On Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cilium is the only supported network policy engine, reflecting Azure’s investment in performance, scalability, and security.
Azure Kubernetes Service integrates Cilium as a managed component, simplifying network security enforcement. Administrators can define Cilium Network Policies directly within their AKS clusters without requiring external controllers.

Cilium extends the usage of labels with Identities. Large clusters with many pods might experience scale issues where constantly updating IP filters occurs with a high pod churn rate. Under the hood, Identities map to labels and allow connections to initiate as soon as the identity resolves rather than needing to update rules on nodes.

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

Use the following command to create a cluster with Azure CNI powered by cilium

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Anatomy of the Cilium Network Policy

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium, you can configure network policies natively in Kubernetes using two available formats:

**The standard**, which supports L3 and L4 policies at ingress or egress of the Pod.`NetworkPolicy`

resource**The extended**, which is available as a CustomResourceDefinition that supports specification of policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

format

With these CRDs, we can define security policies, and Kubernetes automatically distributes these policies to all the nodes in the cluster.

A Network Policy consists of several key components:

**Pod selector**: Specifies which pods the policy applies to using labels.**Policy types**: Determines whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming traffic), egress (outgoing traffic), or both.**Ingress rules**: Defines allowed sources (pods, namespaces, or IP ranges) and ports.**Egress rules**: Defines allowed destinations and ports.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: frontend-egress namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: frontend policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080`


## Advanced Network Policy

Azure Kubernetes services offers the [Advanced Container Networking Service (ACNS)](/en-us/azure/aks/advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium) a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of AKS clusters.

A key feature of ACNS is Container Network Security, which offers advanced security functionalities to safeguard containerized workloads. One notable aspect is the ability to implement advanced network policies, including Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering and Layer 7 (L7) policies, allowing for more granular control over both egress traffic and application-layer communication.

### Secure Egress traffic with FQDN Filtering

Traditionally, network policies in Kubernetes are based on IP addresses. However, in dynamic environments where pod IPs frequently change, managing such policies becomes cumbersome. [FQDN filtering](/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-concepts#overview-of-fqdn-filtering) simplifies this by allowing policies to be defined using domain names instead of IP addresses. This approach provides a more intuitive and user-friendly method of controlling network traffic, allowing organizations to enforce security policies with greater precision and flexibility.

Implementing FQDN filtering in AKS clusters requires enabling ACNS and configuring the necessary policies to define allowed or blocked domains, thereby enhancing the security posture of your containerized applications.

To enable Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), use the flag --enable-acns

#### Example: Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Build a network policy that allows traffic to “bing.com”

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


### Protection and security for APIs with L7 policies

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication, securing these interactions at the network layer alone is no longer sufficient. Standard network policies operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), controlling which pods can communicate, but they lack visibility into the actual API requests being made.

Layer 7 (L7) policies provide the following benefits and features:

**Granular API security**: Enforce policies based on HTTP, gRPC, or Kafka request data, rather than just IP addresses and ports.**Reduced attack surface**: Prevent unauthorized access and mitigate API-based attacks by filtering traffic at the application layer.**Compliance and auditing**: Ensure adherence to security standards by logging and controlling specific API interactions.**Simplified policy management**: Avoid the operational burden of additional sidecar proxies by leveraging built-in Cilium-powered L7 controls.

L7 policies AKS are enabled through ACNS and are available to customers using Azure CNI powered by Cilium. These policies support HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka protocols.

To enforce L7 policies, customers define `CiliumNetworkPolicy`

resources, specifying rules for application-layer traffic control.

#### Example: Enable ACNS on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Allow only GET requests to /api from the frontend pod to the backend service on port 8080

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


## Strategies for network policies

Securing Kubernetes workloads requires a thoughtful approach to defining and enforcing network policies. A well-designed strategy ensures that applications communicate only as intended, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and potential breaches. The following sections cover key strategies for implementing effective Kubernetes Network Policies.

### Adopt a Zero-Trust model

By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted communication between all pods in a cluster. A Zero-Trust approach dictates that no traffic should be trusted by default, and only explicitly allowed communication paths should be permitted. Implementing a default deny-all network policy ensures that only necessary traffic flows between workloads.

Example of a deny-all policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
- Egress
```


### Namespace and multi-tenancy segmentation

In multi-tenant environments, namespaces help isolate workloads. Different teams typically manage their applications within dedicated namespaces, ensuring logical isolation between workloads. This separation is critical when multiple applications run alongside each other. Applying network policies at the namespace scope is often the first step in securing workloads, as it prevents unrestricted lateral movement between applications managed by different teams.

For example, restrict all ingress traffic to a namespace, allowing only traffic from the same namespace:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: restrict-cross-namespace
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
- namespaceSelector:
matchLabels:
name: team-a
```


### Microsegmentation for workload isolation

While namespace-based segmentation is an essential first step in securing multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, application-level microsegmentation provides fine-grained control over how workloads interact within a namespace. Namespace isolation alone does not prevent unintended or unauthorized communication between different applications within the same namespace. This is where pod-level segmentation becomes critical.

For instance, if a frontend service should only talk to a backend service within the same namespace, a policy using pod labels can enforce this restriction:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-to-backend
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 8080
```


This prevents frontend pods from making unintended connections to other services, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement inside the namespace.

By combining namespace-wide isolation with fine-grained application-level policies, teams can implement a multi-layered security model that prevents unauthorized traffic while allowing necessary communication for application functionality.

### Layered security approach

Network security should be implemented in layers, combining multiple levels of enforcement:

**L3/L4 policies**: Restrict traffic at the IP and port level (for example: allow TCP traffic on port 443).**FQDN-based filtering**: Restrict external communication based on domain names rather than IP addresses.**L7 policies**: Control communication based on application-layer attributes (for example: allow only HTTP GET requests to specific API paths).

For example, a Cilium L7 policy can restrict frontend services to only issue GET requests to the backend API:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


This prevents the frontend from making POST or DELETE requests, limiting the attack surface.

### Integrating RBAC with Network Policy management

Role-based access control (RBAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users or teams can create, modify, or delete network policies. Without proper access controls, a misconfigured policy could either expose workloads to unauthorized access or unintentionally block critical application traffic.

By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC in conjunction with network policies, organizations can enforce separation of duties between platform administrators, security teams, and application developers. A typical approach is:

- Platform or security teams define baseline security policies that enforce compliance and restrict external access.
- Application teams are granted limited permissions to create or update network policies only for their respective namespaces.

For example, the following RBAC policy allows developers to create and modify network policies but only within their assigned namespace:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: network-policy-editor
namespace: team-a
rules:
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
resources: ["networkpolicies"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```


This role can then be bound to a specific team using a RoleBinding:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
name: team-a-network-policy-binding
namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer@example.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: network-policy-editor
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


By restricting network policy modifications to designated teams and namespaces, organizations can prevent accidental misconfigurations or unauthorized changes while still allowing flexibility for developers to implement application-specific security policies.

This approach reinforces the principle of least privilege while ensuring that network segmentation strategies remain consistent, secure, and aligned with organizational policies.

## Legacy and third-party solutions

### Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)

Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) is a legacy solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies on AKS. As we continue to evolve our networking stack, we intend to deprecate NPM soon.

We strongly recommend all customers transition to Cilium Network Policy, which provides better performance, scalability, and enhanced security through eBPF-based enforcement. Cilium is the future of network policy in AKS and offers a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to NPM.

### NetworkPolicy support for Windows nodes

AKS doesn't natively support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Windows nodes out of the box. To enable network policies for Windows workloads, you can use Calico for Windows nodes, which is integrated into AKS to simplify deployment. You can enable it using the `--network-policy calico`

flag when creating a cluster.

Microsoft doesn't maintain the Calico images used in this integration. Our support is limited to ensuring Calico is properly integrated with AKS and functions as expected within the platform. Any issues related to Calico upstream bugs, feature requests, or troubleshooting beyond AKS integration should be directed to the Calico open-source community or Tigera, the maintainers of Calico.

### Calico open source – Third-party solution

Calico open source is a widely used third-party solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies. It supports both Linux and Windows nodes and provides advanced networking and security capabilities, including network policy enforcement, workload identity, and encryption.

While Calico is integrated with AKS for Windows network policies (`--network-policy calico`

), it remains an open-source project maintained by Tigera. Microsoft doesn't maintain Calico images and provides limited support focused on ensuring proper integration with AKS. For advanced troubleshooting, feature requests, or issues beyond AKS integration, we recommend reaching out to the Calico open-source community or Tigera.

For Linux nodes, we strongly recommend using Cilium for network policy enforcement. For Windows nodes, we recommend using Calico.

## Conclusion

Network policies are a fundamental part of Kubernetes security, enabling organizations to control traffic flow, enforce workload isolation, and reduce the attack surface. As cloud-native environments evolve, relying solely on basic Layer 3/4 policies is no longer sufficient. Advanced solutions, such as Layer 7 filtering and FQDN-based policies, provide the granular security and flexibility needed to protect modern applications.

By following best practices including zero-trust model, microsegmentation, and adopting scalable solutions like Azure managed Cilium teams can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. As Kubernetes networking continues to evolve, adopting modern, observability-driven approaches will be key to securing workloads effectively.

# Simplified application autoscaling with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple and is a Cloud Native Computing Federation (CNCF) Graduate project.

It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.

The KEDA add-on makes it even easier by deploying a managed KEDA installation, providing you with [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) that you can scale your applications with on your Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster.

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.32.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Architecture

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/) provides two main components:

**KEDA operator**allows end-users to scale workloads in or out from 0 to N instances with support for Kubernetes Deployments, Jobs,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource.**Metrics server**exposes external metrics to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes for autoscaling purposes such as messages in a Kafka topic, or number of events in an Azure event hub. Due to upstream limitations, KEDA must be the only installed external metric adapter.


Learn more about how KEDA works in the [official KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/).

## Installation

KEDA can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the KEDA add-on using an [ARM template](keda-deploy-add-on-arm) or [Azure CLI](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

The KEDA add-on provides a fully supported installation of KEDA that is integrated with AKS.

## Capabilities and features

KEDA provides the following capabilities and features:

- Build sustainable and cost-efficient applications with scale-to-zero
- Scale application workloads to meet demand using
[a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) - Autoscale applications with
`ScaledObjects`

, such as Deployments,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource - Autoscale job-like workloads with
`ScaledJobs`

- Use production-grade security by decoupling autoscaling authentication from workloads
- Bring-your-own external scaler to use tailor-made autoscaling decisions
- Integrate with
[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview)for authentication

Note

If you plan to use workload identity, [enable the workload identity add-on](workload-identity-deploy-cluster) before enabling the KEDA add-on.

## Add-on limitations

The KEDA AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- KEDA's
[HTTP add-on (preview)](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on)to scale HTTP workloads isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - KEDA's
[external scaler for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)to scale based on Azure Cosmos DB change feed isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - Only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of that the KEDA add-on should be the only external metrics server inside the cluster.
- Multiple KEDA installations aren't supported

- It's not recommended to combine KEDA's
`ScaledObject`

with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload. They compete with each other because KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in the background and results in odd scaling behavior.- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created and the KEDA`ScaledObject`

would fail to be created. - If a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created first and then an HPA is created, the HPA creation isn't blocked.

- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA

For general KEDA questions, we recommend [visiting the FAQ overview](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/reference/faq/).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Supported Kubernetes and KEDA versions

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version is installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

# Overview of FQDN filtering

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

# Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create extension instances in an AKS cluster, setting required and optional parameters including options related to updates and configurations. You can also view, list, update, and delete extension instances.

Before you begin, read about [cluster extensions](cluster-extensions).

Note

The examples provided in this article are not complete, and are only meant to showcase functionality. For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, see the [az k8s-extension CLI reference](/en-us/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).The

`Microsoft.ContainerService`

and`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

resource providers must be registered on your subscription. To register these providers, run the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --wait az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait`

An AKS cluster. This cluster must have been created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters. For new clusters created with

`az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters, switch to manage identity by running`az aks update`

with the`--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see[Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version >= 2.16.0 installed. We recommend using the latest version.The latest version of the

`k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extensions. Install the extension by running the following command:`az extension add --name k8s-extension`

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

### Required parameters

# Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


```
az aks create \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--node-count 3 \
--outbound-type managedNATGateway \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 2 \
--nat-gateway-idle-timeout 4 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


- Update the outbound IP address or idle timeout using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

or`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameter.

The following example updates the NAT gateway managed outbound IP count for the AKS cluster to 5.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 5
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ... "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" }`


## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet frequently asked questions

**Can I deploy VMs in my cluster subnet?**Yes for Azure CNI Node Subnet, the VMs can be deployed in the same subnet as the AKS cluster.

**What source IP do external systems see for traffic that originates in an Azure CNI-enabled pod?**Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod.

# Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects unscheduled pods, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demand. It also regularly checks nodes that don't have any scheduled pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article helps you understand how the cluster autoscaler works in AKS. It also provides guidance, best practices, and considerations when configuring the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads. If you want to enable, disable, or update the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

## About the cluster autoscaler

Clusters often need a way to scale automatically to adjust to changing application demands, such as between workdays and evenings or weekends. AKS clusters can scale in the following ways:

- The
**cluster autoscaler**periodically checks for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. Manual scaling is disabled when you use the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see[How does scale up work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-up-work). - The
uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) - The
automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage to ensure pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the required CPU and memory resources.[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler)


It's a common practice to enable cluster autoscaler for nodes and either the Vertical Pod Autoscaler or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pods. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, it applies the specified scaling rules when the node pool size is lower than the minimum node count, up to the maximum node count. The cluster autoscaler waits to take effect until a new node is needed in the node pool or until a node might be safely deleted from the current node pool. For more information, see [How does scale down work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-down-work)

## Best practices and considerations

- When implementing
**availability zones with the cluster autoscaler**, we recommend using a single node pool for each zone. You can set the`--balance-similar-node-groups`

parameter to`True`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale up operations. When this approach isn't implemented, scale down operations can disrupt the balance of nodes across zones.

Note

The Cluster Autoscaler is not zone-aware, and zone allocation is handled by the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Sets. The above best practice becomes even more relevant when using zone-based [pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) on a single multi-zonal node pool, as restrictive constraints may leave pods in a pending state, especially in capacity-constrained regions or during zone-down scenarios.

For

**clusters with more than 400 nodes**, we recommend using Azure CNI or Azure CNI Overlay.To

**effectively run workloads concurrently on both Spot and On-demand node pools**, consider using. This approach allows you to scale out nodepools based on assigned priority. The following configuration illustrates this setup.*priority expanders*`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander namespace: kube-system data: priorities: |- 10: - .*spotpool1.* - .*spotpool2.* 50: - .*ondemandpool1.*`

Exercise caution when

**assigning CPU/Memory requests on pods**. The cluster autoscaler scales up based on pending pods rather than CPU/Memory pressure on nodes.For

**clusters concurrently hosting both long-running workloads, like web apps, and short/bursty job workloads**, we recommend separating them into distinct node pools with[Affinity Rules](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)/[expanders](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders).Use

[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)to help prevent unnecessary node drain or scale down operations. Specifying the annotation[cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#cluster-autoscaler-kubernetes-io-safe-to-evict)on the Pod spec will also prevent the pods from being evicted. Use this annotation with caution, as it may cause the Cluster Autoscaler encounter issues when draining a node with a running Pod that includes this annotation.In an autoscaler-enabled node pool, scale down nodes by removing workloads, instead of manually reducing the min/ max count of the node pool. This can be problematic if the node pool is already at maximum capacity or if there are active workloads running on the nodes, potentially causing unexpected behavior by the cluster autoscaler.

Nodes don't scale up if pods have a PriorityClass value below -10. Priority -10 is reserved for

[overprovisioning pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler). For more information, see[Using the cluster autoscaler with Pod Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-cluster-autoscaler-work-with-pod-priority-and-preemption).**Don't combine other node autoscaling mechanisms**, such as Virtual Machine Scale Set autoscalers, with the cluster autoscaler.The cluster autoscaler

**might be unable to scale down if pods can't move, such as in the following situations**:- A directly created pod not backed by a controller object, such as a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
- A pod disruption budget (PDB) that's too restrictive and doesn't allow the number of pods to fall below a certain threshold.
- A pod uses node selectors or anti-affinity that can't be honored if scheduled on a different node.
For more information, see
[What types of pods can prevent the cluster autoscaler from removing a node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node).


Important

**Don't make changes to individual nodes within the autoscaled node pools**. All nodes in the same node group should have uniform capacity, labels, taints and system pods running on them.

- The cluster autoscaler isn't responsible for enforcing a "maximum node count" in a cluster node pool irrespective of pod scheduling considerations. If any non-cluster autoscaler actor sets the node pool count to a number beyond the cluster autoscaler's configured maximum, the cluster autoscaler doesn't automatically remove nodes. The cluster autoscaler scale down behaviors remain scoped to removing underutilized nodes. The sole purpose of the cluster autoscaler's max node count configuration is to enforce an upper limit for scale up operations. It doesn't have any effect on scale down considerations.

## Cluster autoscaler profile

The [cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler-profile-settings) is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler. You can configure the cluster autoscaler profile when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster.

### Optimizing the cluster autoscaler profile

You should fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile settings according to your specific workload scenarios while also considering tradeoffs between performance and cost. This section provides examples that demonstrate those tradeoffs.

It's important to note that the cluster autoscaler profile settings are cluster-wide and applied to all autoscale-enabled node pools. Any scaling actions that take place in one node pool can affect the autoscaling behavior of other node pools, which can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you apply consistent and synchronized profile configurations across all relevant node pools to ensure you get your desired results.

#### Example 1: Optimizing for performance

For clusters that handle substantial and bursty workloads with a primary focus on performance, we recommend increasing the `scan-interval`

and decreasing the `scale-down-utilization-threshold`

. These settings help batch multiple scaling operations into a single call, optimizing scaling time and the utilization of compute read/write quotas. It also helps mitigate the risk of swift scale down operations on underutilized nodes, enhancing the pod scheduling efficiency. Also increase `ok-total-unready-count`

and `max-total-unready-percentage`

.

For clusters with daemonset pods, we recommend setting `ignore-daemonsets-utilization`

to `true`

, which effectively ignores node utilization by daemonset pods and minimizes unnecessary scale down operations. See [profile for bursty workloads](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-bursty-workloads)

#### Example 2: Optimizing for cost

If you want a [cost-optimized profile](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down), we recommend setting the following parameter configurations:

- Reduce
`scale-down-unneeded-time`

, which is the amount of time a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. - Reduce
`scale-down-delay-after-add`

, which is the amount of time to wait after a node is added before considering it for scale down. - Increase
`scale-down-utilization-threshold`

, which is the utilization threshold for removing nodes. - Increase
`max-empty-bulk-delete`

, which is the maximum number of nodes that can be deleted in a single call. - Set
`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

to false. - Increase
`ok-total-unready-count`

and`max-total-unready-percentage`

.

### Node pool in backoff

Node pool in backoff was introduced in version 0.6.2 and causes the cluster autoscaler to back off from scaling a node pool after a failure.

Depending on how long the scaling operations have been experiencing failures, it may take up to 30 minutes before making another attempt. You can reset the node pool's backoff state by disabling and then re-enabling autoscaling.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors

If the extension fails to create or update, try suggestions and solutions in the [Azure App Configuration extension troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/extensions/troubleshoot-app-configuration-extension-installation-errors).

## Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider errors via the [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#troubleshooting).

## Delete the extension

If you need to delete the extension and remove Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider from your AKS cluster, you can use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --cluster-type managedClusters --name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider
```


## Next Steps

- Learn more about
[extra settings and preferences you can set on the Azure App Configuration extension](azure-app-configuration-settings). - Once you successfully install Azure App Configuration extension in your AKS cluster, try
[quickstart](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service)to learn how to use it. - See all the supported features of
[Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/reference-kubernetes-provider).

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Best practices for network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes, by default, operates as a flat network where all pods can communicate freely with each other. This unrestricted connectivity can be convenient for developers but poses significant security risks as applications scale. Imagine an organization deploying multiple microservices, each handling sensitive data, customer transactions, or backend operations. Without any restrictions, any compromised pod could potentially access unauthorized data or disrupt services.

To address these security concerns, [Network Policies in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow administrators to control and restrict traffic between workloads. They provide a declarative way to enforce traffic rules, ensuring secure and controlled network behavior within a cluster.

## What is Kubernetes Network Policy?

A Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that control how pods communicate with each other and with external services. It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, allowing administrators to enforce security and segmentation at the namespace level. By implementing Network Policies, you gain:

**Stronger security posture**: Prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the cluster.**Compliance and governance**: Enforce regulatory requirements by controlling communication pathways.**Reduced blast radius**: Limit the impact of a compromised workload by restricting its network access.

Initially, Network Policies were designed to operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model, enabling basic control over pod-to-pod and external communications. However, advanced network policy engines like Cilium have extended Network Policies to Layer 7 (Application Layer), allowing deeper control over application traffic for modern cloud-native applications.

Network Policies are defined at the namespace level, meaning each policy applies to workloads within a specific namespace. The main components of a Network Policy include:

**Pod selector**: Defines which pods the policy applies to based on labels.**Ingress rules**: Specify the allowed incoming connections.**Egress rules**: Specify the allowed outgoing connections.**Policy types**: Define whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming), egress (outgoing), or both.

## Foundations of building effective network policies

Building effective network policies in Kubernetes isn't just about writing YAML configurations—it requires a deep understanding of your application architecture, traffic patterns, and security requirements. Without a clear picture of how workloads communicate, enforcing security policies can lead to unintended disruptions or gaps in protection. The following sections cover how to systematically approach network policy design.

### Understanding your workload connectivity

Before implementing network policies, you need visibility into how workloads communicate with each other and external services. This step ensures that policies don’t inadvertently block critical traffic while effectively limiting unnecessary exposure.

**Leverage Visibility Tools:**in addition to the network requirements provided by application team you can use tools like[Cilium Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble), and[Retina](https://retina.sh/)help you analyze pod-to-pod traffic, identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database. Identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database.**The importance of labels in network policies:**Traditionally, network security policies have relied on static IP addresses to define traffic rules. This approach is problematic in Kubernetes because pods are ephemeral—created and destroyed frequently, often with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Maintaining security rules based on constantly changing IPs would require continuous updates, making policy management inefficient and error-prone.

Labels solve this challenge by providing a stable way to group workloads. Instead of relying on fixed IPs, Kubernetes Network Policies use labels to define security rules that remain consistent even as pods restart or shift across nodes. For example, a policy can allow communication between pods labeled `app: frontend`

and `app: backend`

, ensuring traffic flows as intended regardless of pod IP changes. This label-based approach is critical for achieving scalable, intent-driven network security in cloud-native environments.

A well-defined labeling strategy simplifies policy management, reduces misconfigurations, and enhances security enforcement across clusters.

**Define Micro-segmentation:**Organizing workloads into security zones (e.g., frontend, backend, database) helps enforce the principle of least privilege. For instance, microservices handling customer transactions should be isolated from general-purpose applications.

### Layered security approach for Kubernetes

Relying solely on basic Kubernetes Network Policies might not be sufficient for all security needs. A layered approach ensures comprehensive protection across different levels of network communication.

**(L3/L4) policies**: The foundation of network security, controlling traffic based on pod labels and namespaces at the IP, port, and protocol level.**FQDN-based policies**: Restrict egress traffic to specific external domains, ensuring workloads can only reach approved external services (for example: only allowing access to*microsoft.com*for API calls).**Layer 7 policies**: Introduces fine-grained control over traffic by filtering requests based on HTTP methods, headers, and paths. This is useful for securing APIs and enforcing application-layer security policies.

### Management of Network Policies

Who should manage network policies? This often depends on an organization’s structure and security requirements. A well-balanced approach allows both security teams and application developers to collaborate effectively.

**Centralized security administration**: Security or networking teams should define baseline policies to enforce global security requirements, such as default deny-all rules or compliance-driven restrictions.**Developer autonomy with guardrails**: Application teams should be able to define service-specific network policies within their namespaces, enabling security while maintaining agility.**Policy lifecycle management**: Regularly reviewing and updating policies ensures that security remains aligned with evolving application architectures. Observability tools can help detect policy misconfigurations and missing rules.

#### Example: Securing a multi-tier web application with Network Policies

**Step 1: Understanding workload connectivity**

- Visibility tools: Use Cilium Hubble to observe how pods communicate.


Mapping connectivity:

Source Destination Protocol Port Frontend Backend TCP 8080 Backend Database TCP 5432 Backend External Payment Gateway TCP 443

**Step 2: Applying labels for policy enforcement**

By labeling workloads correctly, policies can remain stable even if pod IPs change.

`app: frontend`

for UI pods.`app: backend`

for API pods.`app: database`

for DB pods.

**Step 3: Implementing application-level Network Policies**

In this example, we use two layers of network policies: an L3/L4 basic policy to control traffic between microservices and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) policy to control egress traffic with external payment gateway.

| Allow frontend to communicate with backend | Allow backend to access the database | Allow backend to reach external payment API |
|---|---|---|
Policy 1: Frontend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` Policy 2: Backend ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: frontend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` |
Policy 1: Backend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: database` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` Policy 2: Database ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` |
Policy 1: Backend`spec:` ` endpointSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` egress:` ` - toFQDNs:` ` - matchName: payments.example.com` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 443` |

**Step 4: Managing and maintaining policies**

Security and platform teams enforce baseline deny rules.

Baseline policy Platform policy Security - Default deny all traffic - Allow DNS

- Allow Logs- Block traffic

to known

malicious IPs

and domainsEnsuring that the application's network policies comply with platform and security requirements while avoiding any policy violations.

## Azure Powered by Cilium

[Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security for Kubernetes workloads. Unlike traditional CNIs that rely on iptables-based packet filtering, Azure CNI powered by Cilium uses eBPF to operate at the kernel level, enabling efficient and scalable network policy enforcement. On Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cilium is the only supported network policy engine, reflecting Azure’s investment in performance, scalability, and security.
Azure Kubernetes Service integrates Cilium as a managed component, simplifying network security enforcement. Administrators can define Cilium Network Policies directly within their AKS clusters without requiring external controllers.

Cilium extends the usage of labels with Identities. Large clusters with many pods might experience scale issues where constantly updating IP filters occurs with a high pod churn rate. Under the hood, Identities map to labels and allow connections to initiate as soon as the identity resolves rather than needing to update rules on nodes.

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

Use the following command to create a cluster with Azure CNI powered by cilium

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Anatomy of the Cilium Network Policy

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium, you can configure network policies natively in Kubernetes using two available formats:

**The standard**, which supports L3 and L4 policies at ingress or egress of the Pod.`NetworkPolicy`

resource**The extended**, which is available as a CustomResourceDefinition that supports specification of policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

format

With these CRDs, we can define security policies, and Kubernetes automatically distributes these policies to all the nodes in the cluster.

A Network Policy consists of several key components:

**Pod selector**: Specifies which pods the policy applies to using labels.**Policy types**: Determines whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming traffic), egress (outgoing traffic), or both.**Ingress rules**: Defines allowed sources (pods, namespaces, or IP ranges) and ports.**Egress rules**: Defines allowed destinations and ports.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: frontend-egress namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: frontend policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080`


## Advanced Network Policy

Azure Kubernetes services offers the [Advanced Container Networking Service (ACNS)](/en-us/azure/aks/advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium) a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of AKS clusters.

A key feature of ACNS is Container Network Security, which offers advanced security functionalities to safeguard containerized workloads. One notable aspect is the ability to implement advanced network policies, including Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering and Layer 7 (L7) policies, allowing for more granular control over both egress traffic and application-layer communication.

### Secure Egress traffic with FQDN Filtering

Traditionally, network policies in Kubernetes are based on IP addresses. However, in dynamic environments where pod IPs frequently change, managing such policies becomes cumbersome. [FQDN filtering](/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-concepts#overview-of-fqdn-filtering) simplifies this by allowing policies to be defined using domain names instead of IP addresses. This approach provides a more intuitive and user-friendly method of controlling network traffic, allowing organizations to enforce security policies with greater precision and flexibility.

Implementing FQDN filtering in AKS clusters requires enabling ACNS and configuring the necessary policies to define allowed or blocked domains, thereby enhancing the security posture of your containerized applications.

To enable Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), use the flag --enable-acns

#### Example: Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Build a network policy that allows traffic to “bing.com”

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


### Protection and security for APIs with L7 policies

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication, securing these interactions at the network layer alone is no longer sufficient. Standard network policies operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), controlling which pods can communicate, but they lack visibility into the actual API requests being made.

Layer 7 (L7) policies provide the following benefits and features:

**Granular API security**: Enforce policies based on HTTP, gRPC, or Kafka request data, rather than just IP addresses and ports.**Reduced attack surface**: Prevent unauthorized access and mitigate API-based attacks by filtering traffic at the application layer.**Compliance and auditing**: Ensure adherence to security standards by logging and controlling specific API interactions.**Simplified policy management**: Avoid the operational burden of additional sidecar proxies by leveraging built-in Cilium-powered L7 controls.

L7 policies AKS are enabled through ACNS and are available to customers using Azure CNI powered by Cilium. These policies support HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka protocols.

To enforce L7 policies, customers define `CiliumNetworkPolicy`

resources, specifying rules for application-layer traffic control.

#### Example: Enable ACNS on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Allow only GET requests to /api from the frontend pod to the backend service on port 8080

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


## Strategies for network policies

Securing Kubernetes workloads requires a thoughtful approach to defining and enforcing network policies. A well-designed strategy ensures that applications communicate only as intended, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and potential breaches. The following sections cover key strategies for implementing effective Kubernetes Network Policies.

### Adopt a Zero-Trust model

By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted communication between all pods in a cluster. A Zero-Trust approach dictates that no traffic should be trusted by default, and only explicitly allowed communication paths should be permitted. Implementing a default deny-all network policy ensures that only necessary traffic flows between workloads.

Example of a deny-all policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
- Egress
```


### Namespace and multi-tenancy segmentation

In multi-tenant environments, namespaces help isolate workloads. Different teams typically manage their applications within dedicated namespaces, ensuring logical isolation between workloads. This separation is critical when multiple applications run alongside each other. Applying network policies at the namespace scope is often the first step in securing workloads, as it prevents unrestricted lateral movement between applications managed by different teams.

For example, restrict all ingress traffic to a namespace, allowing only traffic from the same namespace:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: restrict-cross-namespace
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
- namespaceSelector:
matchLabels:
name: team-a
```


### Microsegmentation for workload isolation

While namespace-based segmentation is an essential first step in securing multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, application-level microsegmentation provides fine-grained control over how workloads interact within a namespace. Namespace isolation alone does not prevent unintended or unauthorized communication between different applications within the same namespace. This is where pod-level segmentation becomes critical.

For instance, if a frontend service should only talk to a backend service within the same namespace, a policy using pod labels can enforce this restriction:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-to-backend
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 8080
```


This prevents frontend pods from making unintended connections to other services, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement inside the namespace.

By combining namespace-wide isolation with fine-grained application-level policies, teams can implement a multi-layered security model that prevents unauthorized traffic while allowing necessary communication for application functionality.

### Layered security approach

Network security should be implemented in layers, combining multiple levels of enforcement:

**L3/L4 policies**: Restrict traffic at the IP and port level (for example: allow TCP traffic on port 443).**FQDN-based filtering**: Restrict external communication based on domain names rather than IP addresses.**L7 policies**: Control communication based on application-layer attributes (for example: allow only HTTP GET requests to specific API paths).

For example, a Cilium L7 policy can restrict frontend services to only issue GET requests to the backend API:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


This prevents the frontend from making POST or DELETE requests, limiting the attack surface.

### Integrating RBAC with Network Policy management

Role-based access control (RBAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users or teams can create, modify, or delete network policies. Without proper access controls, a misconfigured policy could either expose workloads to unauthorized access or unintentionally block critical application traffic.

By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC in conjunction with network policies, organizations can enforce separation of duties between platform administrators, security teams, and application developers. A typical approach is:

- Platform or security teams define baseline security policies that enforce compliance and restrict external access.
- Application teams are granted limited permissions to create or update network policies only for their respective namespaces.

For example, the following RBAC policy allows developers to create and modify network policies but only within their assigned namespace:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: network-policy-editor
namespace: team-a
rules:
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
resources: ["networkpolicies"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```


This role can then be bound to a specific team using a RoleBinding:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
name: team-a-network-policy-binding
namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer@example.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: network-policy-editor
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


By restricting network policy modifications to designated teams and namespaces, organizations can prevent accidental misconfigurations or unauthorized changes while still allowing flexibility for developers to implement application-specific security policies.

This approach reinforces the principle of least privilege while ensuring that network segmentation strategies remain consistent, secure, and aligned with organizational policies.

## Legacy and third-party solutions

### Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)

Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) is a legacy solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies on AKS. As we continue to evolve our networking stack, we intend to deprecate NPM soon.

We strongly recommend all customers transition to Cilium Network Policy, which provides better performance, scalability, and enhanced security through eBPF-based enforcement. Cilium is the future of network policy in AKS and offers a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to NPM.

### NetworkPolicy support for Windows nodes

AKS doesn't natively support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Windows nodes out of the box. To enable network policies for Windows workloads, you can use Calico for Windows nodes, which is integrated into AKS to simplify deployment. You can enable it using the `--network-policy calico`

flag when creating a cluster.

Microsoft doesn't maintain the Calico images used in this integration. Our support is limited to ensuring Calico is properly integrated with AKS and functions as expected within the platform. Any issues related to Calico upstream bugs, feature requests, or troubleshooting beyond AKS integration should be directed to the Calico open-source community or Tigera, the maintainers of Calico.

### Calico open source – Third-party solution

Calico open source is a widely used third-party solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies. It supports both Linux and Windows nodes and provides advanced networking and security capabilities, including network policy enforcement, workload identity, and encryption.

While Calico is integrated with AKS for Windows network policies (`--network-policy calico`

), it remains an open-source project maintained by Tigera. Microsoft doesn't maintain Calico images and provides limited support focused on ensuring proper integration with AKS. For advanced troubleshooting, feature requests, or issues beyond AKS integration, we recommend reaching out to the Calico open-source community or Tigera.

For Linux nodes, we strongly recommend using Cilium for network policy enforcement. For Windows nodes, we recommend using Calico.

## Conclusion

Network policies are a fundamental part of Kubernetes security, enabling organizations to control traffic flow, enforce workload isolation, and reduce the attack surface. As cloud-native environments evolve, relying solely on basic Layer 3/4 policies is no longer sufficient. Advanced solutions, such as Layer 7 filtering and FQDN-based policies, provide the granular security and flexibility needed to protect modern applications.

By following best practices including zero-trust model, microsegmentation, and adopting scalable solutions like Azure managed Cilium teams can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. As Kubernetes networking continues to evolve, adopting modern, observability-driven approaches will be key to securing workloads effectively.

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

### Required parameters

| Parameter name | Description |

# Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


```
az aks create \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--node-count 3 \
--outbound-type managedNATGateway \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 2 \
--nat-gateway-idle-timeout 4 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


- Update the outbound IP address or idle timeout using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

or`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameter.

The following example updates the NAT gateway managed outbound IP count for the AKS cluster to 5.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 5
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ... "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" }`


## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx/agentPools/mynpxxx", "name": "mynpxxx", "osType": "Windows", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools" }`

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

[Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node.

# Overview of FQDN filtering

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

# Install Azure App Configuration AKS extension

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors

If the extension fails to create or update, try suggestions and solutions in the [Azure App Configuration extension troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/extensions/troubleshoot-app-configuration-extension-installation-errors).

## Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider errors via the [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#troubleshooting).

## Delete the extension

If you need to delete the extension and remove Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider from your AKS cluster, you can use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --cluster-type managedClusters --name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider
```


## Next Steps

# Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects unscheduled pods, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demand. It also regularly checks nodes that don't have any scheduled pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article helps you understand how the cluster autoscaler works in AKS. It also provides guidance, best practices, and considerations when configuring the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads. If you want to enable, disable, or update the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

## About the cluster autoscaler

Clusters often need a way to scale automatically to adjust to changing application demands, such as between workdays and evenings or weekends. AKS clusters can scale in the following ways:

- The
**cluster autoscaler**periodically checks for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. Manual scaling is disabled when you use the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see[How does scale up work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-up-work). - The
uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) - The
automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage to ensure pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the required CPU and memory resources.[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler)


It's a common practice to enable cluster autoscaler for nodes and either the Vertical Pod Autoscaler or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pods. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, it applies the specified scaling rules when the node pool size is lower than the minimum node count, up to the maximum node count. The cluster autoscaler waits to take effect until a new node is needed in the node pool or until a node might be safely deleted from the current node pool. For more information, see [How does scale down work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-down-work)

## Best practices and considerations

- When implementing
**availability zones with the cluster autoscaler**, we recommend using a single node pool for each zone. You can set the`--balance-similar-node-groups`

parameter to`True`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale up operations. When this approach isn't implemented, scale down operations can disrupt the balance of nodes across zones.

Note

The Cluster Autoscaler is not zone-aware, and zone allocation is handled by the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Sets. The above best practice becomes even more relevant when using zone-based [pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) on a single multi-zonal node pool, as restrictive constraints may leave pods in a pending state, especially in capacity-constrained regions or during zone-down scenarios.

For

**clusters with more than 400 nodes**, we recommend using Azure CNI or Azure CNI Overlay.To

**effectively run workloads concurrently on both Spot and On-demand node pools**, consider using. This approach allows you to scale out nodepools based on assigned priority. The following configuration illustrates this setup.*priority expanders*`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander namespace: kube-system data: priorities: |- 10: - .*spotpool1.* - .*spotpool2.* 50: - .*ondemandpool1.*`

Exercise caution when

**assigning CPU/Memory requests on pods**. The cluster autoscaler scales up based on pending pods rather than CPU/Memory pressure on nodes.For

**clusters concurrently hosting both long-running workloads, like web apps, and short/bursty job workloads**, we recommend separating them into distinct node pools with[Affinity Rules](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)/[expanders](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders).Use

[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)to help prevent unnecessary node drain or scale down operations. Specifying the annotation[cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#cluster-autoscaler-kubernetes-io-safe-to-evict)on the Pod spec will also prevent the pods from being evicted. Use this annotation with caution, as it may cause the Cluster Autoscaler encounter issues when draining a node with a running Pod that includes this annotation.In an autoscaler-enabled node pool, scale down nodes by removing workloads, instead of manually reducing the min/ max count of the node pool. This can be problematic if the node pool is already at maximum capacity or if there are active workloads running on the nodes, potentially causing unexpected behavior by the cluster autoscaler.

Nodes don't scale up if pods have a PriorityClass value below -10. Priority -10 is reserved for

[overprovisioning pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler). For more information, see[Using the cluster autoscaler with Pod Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-cluster-autoscaler-work-with-pod-priority-and-preemption).**Don't combine other node autoscaling mechanisms**, such as Virtual Machine Scale Set autoscalers, with the cluster autoscaler.The cluster autoscaler

**might be unable to scale down if pods can't move, such as in the following situations**:- A directly created pod not backed by a controller object, such as a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
- A pod disruption budget (PDB) that's too restrictive and doesn't allow the number of pods to fall below a certain threshold.
- A pod uses node selectors or anti-affinity that can't be honored if scheduled on a different node.
For more information, see
[What types of pods can prevent the cluster autoscaler from removing a node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node).


Important

**Don't make changes to individual nodes within the autoscaled node pools**. All nodes in the same node group should have uniform capacity, labels, taints and system pods running on them.

- The cluster autoscaler isn't responsible for enforcing a "maximum node count" in a cluster node pool irrespective of pod scheduling considerations. If any non-cluster autoscaler actor sets the node pool count to a number beyond the cluster autoscaler's configured maximum, the cluster autoscaler doesn't automatically remove nodes. The cluster autoscaler scale down behaviors remain scoped to removing underutilized nodes. The sole purpose of the cluster autoscaler's max node count configuration is to enforce an upper limit for scale up operations. It doesn't have any effect on scale down considerations.

## Cluster autoscaler profile

The [cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler-profile-settings) is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler. You can configure the cluster autoscaler profile when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster.

### Optimizing the cluster autoscaler profile

You should fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile settings according to your specific workload scenarios while also considering tradeoffs between performance and cost. This section provides examples that demonstrate those tradeoffs.

It's important to note that the cluster autoscaler profile settings are cluster-wide and applied to all autoscale-enabled node pools. Any scaling actions that take place in one node pool can affect the autoscaling behavior of other node pools, which can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you apply consistent and synchronized profile configurations across all relevant node pools to ensure you get your desired results.

#### Example 1: Optimizing for performance

For clusters that handle substantial and bursty workloads with a primary focus on performance, we recommend increasing the `scan-interval`

and decreasing the `scale-down-utilization-threshold`

. These settings help batch multiple scaling operations into a single call, optimizing scaling time and the utilization of compute read/write quotas. It also helps mitigate the risk of swift scale down operations on underutilized nodes, enhancing the pod scheduling efficiency. Also increase `ok-total-unready-count`

and `max-total-unready-percentage`

.

For clusters with daemonset pods, we recommend setting `ignore-daemonsets-utilization`

to `true`

, which effectively ignores node utilization by daemonset pods and minimizes unnecessary scale down operations. See [profile for bursty workloads](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-bursty-workloads)

#### Example 2: Optimizing for cost

If you want a [cost-optimized profile](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down), we recommend setting the following parameter configurations:

- Reduce
`scale-down-unneeded-time`

, which is the amount of time a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. - Reduce
`scale-down-delay-after-add`

, which is the amount of time to wait after a node is added before considering it for scale down. - Increase
`scale-down-utilization-threshold`

, which is the utilization threshold for removing nodes. - Increase
`max-empty-bulk-delete`

, which is the maximum number of nodes that can be deleted in a single call. - Set
`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

to false. - Increase
`ok-total-unready-count`

and`max-total-unready-percentage`

.

Node pool in backoff was introduced in version 0.6.2 and causes the cluster autoscaler to back off from scaling a node pool after a failure.

Depending on how long the scaling operations have been experiencing failures, it may take up to 30 minutes before making another attempt. You can reset the node pool's backoff state by disabling and then re-enabling autoscaling.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require either a [Microsoft Entra service principal](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or a [managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources. This article describes how to create a Microsoft Entra service principal and use it with your AKS cluster.

Note

For optimal security and ease of use, we recommend using managed identities instead of service principals to authorize access from an AKS cluster to other resources in Azure. A managed identity is a special type of service principal that you can use to get Microsoft Entra credentials without the need to manage and secure credentials. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- If using Azure PowerShell, you need Azure PowerShell version 5.0.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

- You need permissions to register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and to assign the application to a role in your subscription. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you need to ask your Microsoft Entra ID or subscription administrator to assign the necessary permissions or create the service principal for you.

## Considerations when using a service principal

Keep the following considerations in mind when using a Microsoft Entra service principal with AKS:

- The service principal for Kubernetes is a part of the cluster configuration, but don't use this identity to deploy the cluster. Instead,
[create a service principal](#create-a-service-principal)first, then use that service principal to create the AKS cluster. - Every service principal is associated with a Microsoft Entra application. You can associate the service principal for a Kubernetes cluster with any valid Microsoft Entra application name (for example:
`https://www.contoso.org/example`

). The URL for the application doesn't have to be a real endpoint. - When you specify the service principal
**client ID**, use the value of the application ID (`appId`

for Azure CLI or`ApplicationId`

for Azure PowerShell). - On the agent node virtual machines (VMs) in the AKS cluster, the service principal credentials are stored in the
`/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`

file. - When you delete an AKS cluster that you created using the
command or the`az aks create`

cmdlet, the service principal created isn't automatically deleted. See the`New-AzAksCluster`

[steps to delete a service principal](#delete-a-service-principal). - If you're using a service principal from a different Microsoft Entra tenant, there are other considerations around the permissions available when you deploy the cluster. You might not have the appropriate permissions to read and write directory information. For more information, see
[What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

## Create a service principal

Create a service principal using the

command.`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`# Set environment variable SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "name": "http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the values for

`appId`

and`password`

from the output to use when creating the AKS cluster.

Create a service principal using the

command.`New-AzADServicePrincipal`

`# Set environment variable $SpName = <your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $SpName -OutVariable sp`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`Secret : System.Security.SecureString ServicePrincipalNames : {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal} ApplicationId : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : myAKSClusterServicePrincipal Id : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Type :`

The values are stored in a variable that you use when creating the AKS cluster.

Decrypt the value stored in the

**Secret**secure string using the following command.`$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)`


## Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--service-principal`

and`--client-secret`

parameters set to specify the`appId`

and`password`

values.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> APP_ID=<app-id> CLIENT_SECRET=<password-value> # Create the AKS cluster az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --service-principal $APP_ID \ --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Convert the service principal

`ApplicationId`

and`Secret`

to a**PSCredential**object using the following command.`$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($sp.ApplicationId, $sp.Secret)`

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

cmdlet and specify the`New-AzAksCluster`

`ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret`

parameter with the**PSCredential**object as its value.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> # Create the AKS cluster New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ClusterName -ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret $Cred`


Note

If you're using an existing service principal with customized secret, make sure the secret isn't longer than 190 bytes.

## Delegate access to other Azure resources

You can use the service principal for the AKS cluster to access other resources. For example, if you want to deploy your AKS cluster into an existing Azure virtual network (VNet) subnet, connect to ACR, or access keys or secrets in a key vault from your cluster, then you need to delegate access to those resources to the service principal. To delegate access, assign an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role to the service principal.

When you assign roles, you specify the scope for the role assignment, such as a resource group or VNet resource. The role assignment determines what permissions the service principal has on the resource and at what scope.

Important

Permissions granted to a service principal associated with a cluster can take up 60 minutes to propagate.

## Create a role assignment

Note

The scope for a resource needs to be a full resource ID, such as `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup`

or `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupVnet/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet`

.

Create a role assignment using the

command. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`az role assignment create`

`--assignee`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`--scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`az role assignment create \ --assignee <app-id> \ --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User"`


Create a role assignment using the

cmdlet. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`New-AzRoleAssignment`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`-Scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`New-AzRoleAssignment -ApplicationId <app-id> ` -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" ` -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User"`


## Grant access to Azure Container Registry

If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. We recommend following the steps in [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration) to integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal.

## Grant access to networking resources

If you're using advanced networking with a VNet and subnet or public IP addresses in different resource group, you can assign the [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) built-in role on the subnet within the VNet. Alternatively, you can create a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with permissions to access the network resources in that resource group. For more information, see [AKS service permissions](concepts-identity#aks-service-permissions).

## Grant access to storage disks

If you need to access existing disk resources in another resource group, assign one of the following sets of role permissions:

- Create a
[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)and define the*Microsoft.Compute/disks/read*and*Microsoft.Compute/disks/write*role permissions. - Assign the
[Virtual Machine Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor)built-in role on the resource group.

## Grant access to Azure Container Instances

If you use virtual kubelet to integrate with AKS and run Azure Container Instances (ACI) in resource group separate from the AKS cluster, you need to assign *Contributor* permissions to the AKS cluster service principal for the ACI resource group.

## Delete a service principal

Query for the service principal client ID (

`servicePrincipalProfile.clientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecommand with the`az ad sp delete`

`--id`

parameter. The [`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> # Delete the service principal az ad sp delete --id $(az aks show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId \ --output tsv)`


Query for the service principal client ID (

`ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecmdlet with the`Remove-AzADServicePrincipal`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter. The [`Get-AzAksCluster`

][get-azakscluster] cmdlet retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> $ClientId = (Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster ).ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId # Delete the service principal Remove-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $ClientId`


## Resolve service principal credential issues

Azure CLI caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

Azure PowerShell caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

If these credentials expire, you might encounter errors during AKS cluster deployment. If there's an issue with the cached credentials, you might receive an error message similar to the following error message:

```
Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'.
Details: The credentials in ServicePrincipalProfile were invalid. Please see https://aka.ms/aks-sp-help for more details.
Details: adal: Refresh request failed. Status Code = '401'.
```


You can check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command with the

`"[].endDateTime"`

query. The output shows you the `endDateTime`

of your credentials.```
az ad app credential list \
--id <app-id> \
--query "[].endDateTime" \
--output tsv
```


- Check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the
cmdlet. The output shows you the`Get-AzADAppCredential`

`EndDate`

of your credentials.

```
Get-AzADAppCredential -ApplicationId <app-id>
```


**The default expiration time for the service principal credentials is one year**. If your credentials are older than one year, you can [reset the existing credentials](update-credentials#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials) or [create a new service principal](update-credentials#create-a-new-service-principal).

# Use a service principal with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require either a [Microsoft Entra service principal](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or a [managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources. This article describes how to create a Microsoft Entra service principal and use it with your AKS cluster.

Note

For optimal security and ease of use, we recommend using managed identities instead of service principals to authorize access from an AKS cluster to other resources in Azure. A managed identity is a special type of service principal that you can use to get Microsoft Entra credentials without the need to manage and secure credentials. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- If using Azure PowerShell, you need Azure PowerShell version 5.0.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

- You need permissions to register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and to assign the application to a role in your subscription. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you need to ask your Microsoft Entra ID or subscription administrator to assign the necessary permissions or create the service principal for you.

## Create a service principal

Create a service principal using the

command.`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`# Set environment variable SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "name": "http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the values for

`appId`

and`password`

from the output to use when creating the AKS cluster.

Create a service principal using the

command.`New-AzADServicePrincipal`

`# Set environment variable $SpName = <your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $SpName -OutVariable sp`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`Secret : System.Security.SecureString ServicePrincipalNames : {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal} ApplicationId : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : myAKSClusterServicePrincipal Id : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Type :`

The values are stored in a variable that you use when creating the AKS cluster.

Decrypt the value stored in the

**Secret**secure string using the following command.`$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)`


## Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--service-principal`

and`--client-secret`

parameters set to specify the`appId`

and`password`

values.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> APP_ID=<app-id> CLIENT_SECRET=<password-value> # Create the AKS cluster az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --service-principal $APP_ID \ --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Convert the service principal

`ApplicationId`

and`Secret`

to a**PSCredential**object using the following command.`$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($sp.ApplicationId, $sp.Secret)`

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

cmdlet and specify the`New-AzAksCluster`

`ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret`

parameter with the**PSCredential**object as its value.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> # Create the AKS cluster New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ClusterName -ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret $Cred`


Note

If you're using an existing service principal with customized secret, make sure the secret isn't longer than 190 bytes.

## Delegate access to other Azure resources

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

As an AI engineer or developer, you might have to prototype and deploy AI workloads with a range of different model weights. AKS provides the option to deploy inferencing workloads using open-source presets supported out-of-box and managed in the KAITO [model registry](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets) or to dynamically download from the [HuggingFace registry](https://huggingface.co/models) at runtime onto your AKS cluster.

In this article, you learn how to onboard a sample HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on without having to manage custom images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an account, you can

[create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).An AKS cluster with the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled. For more information, see

[Enable KAITO on an AKS cluster](ai-toolchain-operator#enable-the-ai-toolchain-operator-add-on-on-an-aks-cluster).This example deployment requires quota for the

`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

virtual machine (VM) family in your Azure subscription. If you don't have quota for this VM family, please[request a quota increase](/en-us/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal).Note

Currently, only the HuggingFace runtime supports inference with the KAITO custom model deployment template.


## Choose an open-source language model from HuggingFace

In this example, we use the [BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7) small language model. Alternatively, you can choose from thousands of text-generation models supported on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>`

Clone the KAITO project GitHub repository using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito.git`


## Deploy your model inferencing workload using the KAITO workspace template

Navigate to the

`kaito`

directory and copy the[sample deployment YAML](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/examples/custom-model-integration/custom-model-deployment.yaml)manifest. Replace the default values in the following fields with your model's requirements. For this example, we specify the**bloom-1b7**HuggingFace model ID for[BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7)model:`instanceType`

: The minimum VM size for this inference service deployment is`Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4`

. For larger model sizes you can choose a VM in thefamily with higher memory capacity.`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

`MODEL_ID`

: Replace with your model's specific HuggingFace identifier, which can be found after`https://huggingface.co/`

in the model card URL.`"--torch_dtype"`

: Set to`"float16"`

for compatibility with V100 GPUs. For A100, H100 or newer GPUs, use`"bfloat16"`

.- (Optional)
`HF_TOKEN`

: Specify the values in this section only if you are deploying a private or gated Hugging Face model for inference.

`apiVersion: kaito.sh/v1beta1 kind: Workspace metadata: name: workspace-custom-llm resource: instanceType: "Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4" # Replace with the required VM SKU based on model requirements labelSelector: matchLabels: apps: custom-llm inference: template: spec: containers: - name: custom-llm-container image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/kaito/kaito-base:0.0.8 # KAITO base image which includes hf runtime livenessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 600 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 readinessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 30 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 resources: requests: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Request 1 GPU; adjust as needed limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Optional: Limit to 1 GPU command: - "accelerate" args: - "launch" - "--num_processes" - "1" - "--num_machines" - "1" - "--gpu_ids" - "all" - "tfs/inference_api.py" - "--pipeline" - "text-generation" - "--trust_remote_code" - "--allow_remote_files" - "--pretrained_model_name_or_path" - "bloom-1b7" - "--torch_dtype" - "bfloat16" # env: # HF_TOKEN is required only for private or gated Hugging Face models # Uncomment and configure this block if needed # - name: HF_TOKEN # valueFrom: # secretKeyRef: # name: hf-token-secret # Replace with your Kubernetes Secret name # key: HF_TOKEN # Replace with the specific key holding the token volumeMounts: - name: dshm mountPath: /dev/shm volumes: - name: dshm emptyDir: medium: Memory`

Save these changes to your

`custom-model-deployment.yaml`

file.Run the deployment in your AKS cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f custom-model-deployment.yaml`


## Test your custom model inferencing service

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace using the

`kubectl get workspace`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace-custom-llm -w`

Note

Note that machine readiness can take

*up to 10 minutes*, and workspace readiness*up to 20 minutes*.Check your language model inference service and get the service IP address using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-custom-llm -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')`

Test your custom model inference service with a sample input of your choice using the

[OpenAI API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat):`kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never curl --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -X POST http://$SERVICE_IP/v1/completions \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "bloom-1b7", "prompt": "What sport should I play in rainy weather?", "max_tokens": 20 }'`


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring extra Azure compute charges.

Delete the KAITO inference workspace using the `kubectl delete workspace`

command.

```
kubectl delete workspace workspace-custom-llm
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to onboard a HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on directly to your AKS cluster. To learn more about AI and machine learning on AKS, see the following articles:

# Schedule and deploy batch jobs with Kueue on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to schedule and deploy sample batch jobs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kueue. Also, this guide covers installing Kueue, configuring ResourceFlavors and ClusterQueues for fine-grained resource management, and submitting jobs via LocalQueues. You also learn how to use Kueue to queue up a sample batch job and track the results across Pending, Running, and Finished states.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

To learn more about Kueue and common uses cases for batch workload administrators and users, see [Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview).

## Prerequisites

- An existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Azure CLI installed on your local machine. To install or upgrade, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Helm version 3 or above](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.[The latest version of Kueue installed in a dedicated namespace on your cluster](kueue-overview#prerequisites).

## Define a ResourceFlavor object

In Kueue, a ResourceFlavors enables fine-grained resource management by associating workloads with specific nodes, taints, tolerations, or availability zones. For nodes, `ResourceFlavors`

can define the characteristics like pricing, availability, brands, models, and architecture (that is, x86 versus ARM CPUs). A `ClusterQueue`

uses these flavors to manage quotas and admission policies for workloads.

This configuration defines a `ResourceFlavor`

without any labels or taints, known as an empty `ResourceFlavor`

. This configuration is perfect when quotas for different flavors don't need to be managed.

Create and save a

`ResourceFlavor`

in a file named`resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat << EOF > resourceflavor-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ResourceFlavor metadata: name: on-demand EOF`

apply

`kubectl apply -f resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

verify

`kubectl get resourceflavors`

Example output

`NAME AGE on-demand 5m32s`


## Create a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that governs a pool of resources, defining usage limits and Fair Sharing rules. Where applicable, Fair Sharing rules allow another ClusterQueue in the **same** cohort to unused quota for pending jobs. Each ClusterQueue specifies which flavors it supports and how much quota is available for each.

This sample `ClusterQueue`

defines:

: Indicates that`namespaceSelector: {}`

`sample-jobs`

accepts workloads from any namespace that references this`ClusterQueue`

via a`LocalQueue`

(you can restrict usage (for example, to only team A's namespace) with a label selector).: Defines the standard CPU and memory resource types managed by this`coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"]`

in`resourceGroups`

`ClusterQueue`

.: Only workloads scheduled on`flavor`

of`on-demand`

nodes with`4`

CPUs,`8Gi`

memory`on-demand`

nodes consume this quota. If the cluster uses up this quota, it doesn't admit any other workloads using this flavor (unless you allow borrowing from the`cohort`

).

Create and save a Kueue

`ClusterQueue`

in a file named`clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat <<EOF > clusterqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterQueue metadata: name: sample-jobs spec: cohort: general namespaceSelector: {} # Accept workloads from any namespace resourceGroups: - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"] flavors: - name: on-demand resources: - name: "cpu" nominalQuota: 4 - name: "memory" nominalQuota: 8Gi EOF`

Apply the

`ClusterQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the ClusterQueue` manifest was applied

`kubectl get clusterqueues`

Example output

`NAME COHORT PENDING WORKLOADS sample-jobs general 0`


Note

The `ClusterQueue`

isn't ready for use until a `ResourceFlavor`

object is configured. If you create a `ClusterQueue`

without any existing `ResourceFlavor`

, workloads referencing it are marked as `Inadmissible`

.

## Create a LocalQueue

A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs. A `LocalQueue`

is assigned to one `ClusterQueue`

from which resources are allocated to run its workloads.

This sample `LocalQueue`

configures the following settings:

- Enables users in the
`batch-jobs`

namespace to submit batch workloads to Kueue. - Route the batch workloads to the
`sample-jobs`

`ClusterQueue`

, which manages the actual compute resource quotas and scheduling policies.

Create a namespace named

*batch-jobs*using the`kubectl create`

command.`kubectl create ns batch-jobs`

Create and save a

`LocalQueue`

in a file named`localqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following YAML manifest:`cat <<EOF > localqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: LocalQueue metadata: name: sample-queue namespace: batch-jobs spec: clusterQueue: sample-jobs EOF`

Apply the

`LocalQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f localqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the

`LocalQueue`

manifest was applied`kubectl get localqueues --all-namespaces`

Exampmle output

`NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTERQUEUE PENDING WORKLOADS ADMITTED WORKLOADS batch-jobs sample-queue sample-jobs 0 0`


## Create 2 batch jobs

This configuration defines two Kubernetes batch jobs submitted to the batch-jobs namespace and assigned to the sample-queue managed by Kueue. Both jobs are single-instance (parallelism: 1, completions: 1) and are configured with `Never`

restart policy. The fields `parallelism`

and `completions`

control how many pods are run and how the job is considered complete. So `parallelism`

and `completions`

of 1 means that one pod can run at once, and the job is marked as complete once one pod finishes successfully, per batch job.

- Job test-batch-1: Requests one CPU and 500Mi memory
- Job test-batch-2: Requests two CPUs and 1Gi memory

Create two sample batch jobs to deploy in the

*batch-jobs*namespace using the following YAML manifest named`batch-workloads.yaml`

:`cat <<EOF > batch-workloads.yaml apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-1 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Running test-batch-1; sleep 60"] resources: requests: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" limits: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" restartPolicy: Never --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-2 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Waiting in queue for CPUs...; sleep 30"] resources: requests: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" limits: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" restartPolicy: Never EOF`

Apply the manifest for the batch jobs using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f batch-workloads.yaml`


## Verify Batch Jobs are Submitted to `LocalQueue`


View the status of the batched workloads using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get workloads --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME ADMITTED AGE test-batch-1 True 10s test-batch-2 False 5s`

Run the following command for

`test-batch-2`

while it is in a`Pending`

state`kubectl get workloads test-batch-2 -o yaml`

Expected output

`... ... Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: False Reason: QuotaUnavailable Message: Insufficient quota in ClusterQueue sample-jobs (flavor on-demand): requested 2 CPUs, available 1 ... ...`

After

`test-batch-1`

completes,`test-batch-2`

will be admitted and run.Now, the output should look like the following example output:

`Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: True Last Transition Time: 1234-56-78T00:00:00Z Admission: ClusterQueue: sample-jobs PodSetAssignments: Name: main Flavors: cpu: on-demand memory: on-demand ResourceUsage: cpu: 2 memory: 1Gi`

View the final status of the

`batch-jobs`

namespace using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get job,deploy,rs,pod,workload --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/test-batch-1 Complete 1/1 97s 3m15s job.batch/test-batch-2 Complete 1/1 35s 3m15s NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/test-batch-1-hb8zl 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s pod/test-batch-2-dx9hk 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-1-6fb85 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-2-84f49 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s`


## FAQ

### Question 1: How can I confirm that the Kueue controller is available and running as expected?

Confirm the Kueue controller manager pod is running using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get pods --namespace kueue-system`

The Kueue controller manager pod should be in a

`Running`

state with`1/1`

containers ready, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kueue-controller-manager-xxxxxxx 1/1 Running 0 2m`

If the

`Status`

shows`CrashLoopBackOff`

or`Pending`

, check the deployment logs using the`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs --namespace kueue-system deployment/kueue-controller-manager`


### Question 2: One or more of the Kueue custom resources (CRDs) are missing when I install via Helm. How can I ensure all of the CRDs are installed?

After installing Kueue with the

[Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview)guidance, confirm that all of the CRDs are installed using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get crds | grep kueue`

These CRDs should be listed, as shown in the following example output:

`admissionchecks.kueue.x-k8s.io clusterqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io cohorts.kueue.x-k8s.io localqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueclusters.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io provisioningrequestconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io resourceflavors.kueue.x-k8s.io topologies.kueue.x-k8s.io workloadpriorityclasses.kueue.x-k8s.io workloads.kueue.x-k8s.io`

If one or more of the CRDs are missing, you might see errors in controller logs, failed job queuing,

`CrashLoopBackOff`

for the controller, or inability to admit or schedule workloads. In this case, you can manually reinstall the Kueue CRDs using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/latest/download/kueue-crds.yaml`

Note

Note that if you manually install the CRDs, you need to manually delete them once you're finished using the

`kubectl delete`

command.

### Question 3: What's the difference between a LocalQueue and a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that defines and governs a pool of compute resources like CPU, memory, pods, and accelerators across the entire Kubernetes cluster. A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs within the defined Kubernetes cluster. This separation allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation and multi-tenant scheduling without exposing cluster-wide quotas directly to users.

How they work together:

- A user submits a job to a LocalQueue in their namespace.
- Kueue routes the job to the referenced ClusterQueue.
- The ClusterQueue checks resource availability and quota limits.
- If admitted, the job is unsuspended and scheduled.

## Next steps

In this article, you:

- Installed Kueue on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Helm and verified CRDs, controller health, and namespace setup.
- Configured
`ClusterQueue`

and`LocalQueue`

for general-purpose workloads with resource quotas and flavors (such as on-demand). - Submitted two batch jobs to demonstrate queuing: one admitted immediately, the second held due to quota limits, then admitted when resources became available.
- Monitored workload status and controller logs to confirm scheduling behavior and queuing logic.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Migrate AKS pods from pod-managed identities to [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview) (workload identity) using one of three approaches based on your current [Azure Identity SDK](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-v2-libraries) version: latest SDK parallel deployment, migration sidecar proxy (Linux only), or SDK rewrite.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. Run the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Set environment variables

The following table lists the environment variables used in the commands throughout this article. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.

| Environment variable | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`SUBSCRIPTION_ID` |
The ID of the Azure subscription where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |
`RESOURCE_GROUP` |
The name of the resource group where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `myResourceGroup` |
`LOCATION` |
The Azure region where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `eastus` |
`CLUSTER_NAME` |
The name of the AKS cluster. | `myAKSCluster` |
`MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the user-assigned managed identity. | `myManagedIdentity` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` |
The name of the Kubernetes service account to create or associate with the managed identity. | `workload-identity-sa` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE` |
The namespace of the Kubernetes service account. | `default` |
`FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the federated identity credential to create. | `myFederatedIdentity` |

## Choose a migration path

Select the appropriate migration approach based on your current Azure Identity SDK version:

**Latest Azure Identity SDK**: If your application already uses the latest version of Azure Identity SDK, you can migrate by deploying Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.**Older SDK with migration sidecar**- If your application uses an older SDK version and runs on Linux containers, you can use a temporary migration sidecar to proxy Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions while planning your SDK upgrade.**Older SDK rewrite approach**: If your application uses an older SDK version, you can update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to workload identity.

## Prepare for migration

For all migration paths, you need to have the federated trust set up before you update your application to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following are the minimum steps required:

[Create a managed identity](#create-a-managed-identity)credential.- Associate the user-assigned managed identity with the Kubernetes service account already used for the pod-managed identity or
[create a new Kubernetes service account](#create-kubernetes-service-account)and then associate it with the managed identity. [Establish a federated trust relationship](#establish-federated-identity-credential-trust)between the managed identity and Microsoft Entra ID using the[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)issuer URL and the service account.

## Migrate from latest version of Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application already uses the latest version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to migrate with minimal code changes.

**Migration approach**: Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with pod-managed identity, verify functionality, then remove pod-managed identity.

**Steps**:

- Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify the application can authenticate successfully using workload identity.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations from your application.- Remove the pod-managed identity add-on from your cluster.

## Use a migration sidecar (Linux containers only)

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK, runs on Linux containers, and you need a temporary solution while planning SDK updates.

**Migration approach**: Deploy a migration sidecar that proxies IMDS transactions to OIDC, allowing your existing application code to work without immediate changes.

**Important limitations**:

**Linux containers only**. Windows containers aren't supported.**Temporary solution**that's not intended for long-term production use.**Planning required**to schedule SDK updates for long-term support.

**Steps**:

[Deploy the workload with migration sidecar](#deploy-the-workload-with-migration-sidecar)to proxy IMDS transactions.- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
- Schedule application SDK updates to supported Azure Identity versions.
- Once SDKs are updated, remove the proxy sidecar and redeploy applications.

## Rewrite application for latest Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to update to the latest supported SDK before migrating.

**Migration approach**: Update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID with the updated code.

**Technical outcomes**:

- Uses current Azure Identity SDK versions (no deprecation timeline).
- Supports both Linux and Windows containers (unlike sidecar approach).
- Eliminates proxy components and IMDS translation overhead.

**Steps**:

- Update your application code to use the latest
[Azure Identity SDK](workload-identity-overview#prerequisites). - Test the updated application with pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin authenticating using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations and add-on.

## Set an active Azure subscription

Set a specific Azure subscription as the current active subscription using the

command.`az account set`

`az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Create a managed identity

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Get managed identity client ID

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'clientId' -otsv)"`


## Grant managed identity access to Azure resources

- Grant the managed identity the permissions needed to access the required Azure resources. Follow the steps in
[Assign a managed identity access to a resource](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)to assign the appropriate role to the managed identity.

## Get OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az aks show`

`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)"`

The variable should contain an issuer URL similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/`

By default, the issuer uses the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location the AKS cluster is deployed in. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key.

## Get AKS cluster credentials

Get the AKS cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`


## Create Kubernetes service account

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the managed identity client ID using the

`kubectl apply`

command. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`

The following output resembles successful creation of the identity:

`Serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Establish federated identity credential trust

Create the federated identity credential between the managed identity, service account issuer, and subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create --name $FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME --identity-name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

The federated identity credential takes a few minutes to propagate after being added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the token request might fail because the Azure AD directory cache contains outdated information.


## Deploy the workload with migration sidecar

If your application uses user-assigned managed identity and still relies on IMDS to get an access token you can use the migration sidecar to start migrating to Microsoft Entra Workload ID. In long-term applications, you should modify the code to use the latest Azure Identity SDKs that support client assertion.

To update or deploy the workload, add the following [pod annotations](workload-identity-overview#pod-annotations) to your pod specification (only if you want to use the migration sidecar):

| Pod annotation | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar` |
Indicates whether to inject the proxy sidecar into the pod. | `true` or `false` |
`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port` |
Desired port for the proxy sidecar. | Default value: `8000` |

When you create a pod with these annotations, the Microsoft Entra Workload ID mutating webhook automatically injects the `init-container`

and proxy sidecar to the pod spec. The following YAML shows an example of what the mutating webhook adds to the pod deployment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: httpbin-pod
labels:
app: httpbin
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
annotations:
azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar: "true"
spec:
serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
initContainers:
- name: init-networking
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy-init:v1.1.0
securityContext:
capabilities:
add:
- NET_ADMIN
drop:
- ALL
privileged: true
runAsUser: 0
env:
- name: PROXY_PORT
value: "8000"
containers:
- name: nginx
image: nginx:alpine
ports:
- containerPort: 80
- name: proxy
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy:v1.1.0
ports:
- containerPort: 8000
```


## Verify the workload with migration sidecar

Verify the pod is in a running state using the

command. Replace`kubectl describe pod`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl describe pods <pod-name>`

Verify the pod is passing IMDS transactions using the

command. Replace`kubectl logs`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl logs <pod-name>`

The following example log output resembles successful communication through the proxy sidecar. Verify the logs show a token is successfully acquired and the

`GET`

operation is successful.`I0926 00:29:29.968723 1 proxy.go:97] proxy "msg"="starting the proxy server" "port"=8080 "userAgent"="azure-workload-identity/proxy/v0.13.0-12-gc8527f3 (linux/amd64) c8527f3/2022-09-26-00:19" I0926 00:29:29.972496 1 proxy.go:173] proxy "msg"="received readyz request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/readyz" I0926 00:29:30.936769 1 proxy.go:107] proxy "msg"="received token request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>" I0926 00:29:31.101998 1 proxy.go:129] proxy "msg"="successfully acquired token" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>"`


## Remove pod-managed identity

After you complete your testing and the application can successfully get a token using the proxy sidecar, you can remove the identity and pod-managed identity mapping from your AKS cluster

Remove the pod-managed identity binding from your pod using the

command. Replace`az aks pod-identity delete`

`<pod-identity-name>`

and`<pod-identity-namespace>`

with the name and namespace of your pod identity.`az aks pod-identity delete --name <pod-identity-name> --namespace <pod-identity-namespace> --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

# Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to resize an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It's important to right-size your clusters to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

## Cluster right-sizing

When you create an AKS cluster, you specify the number of nodes and the size of the nodes, which determines the compute capacity of the cluster. Oversized clusters can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersized clusters can lead to performance issues. You can adjust the number and size of the nodes in the cluster to right-size the cluster to meet the needs of your applications.

Consider the following factors when right-sizing your cluster:

**Resource requirements**: Understand the resource requirements of your applications to determine the number of nodes and the size of the nodes needed to run your workloads.**Performance requirements**: Determine the performance requirements of your applications to ensure that the cluster can meet the demands of your workloads.**Cost considerations**: Optimize costs by right-sizing your cluster to avoid unnecessary costs associated with oversized clusters.**Application demands**: Monitor the demands of your applications to adjust the size of the cluster in response to changing demands.**Infrastructure constraints**: Consider the infrastructure constraints of your environment, such as capacity or reserved instance limiting to specific SKUs, to ensure that the cluster can be right-sized within the limits of your environment.

## Monitor cluster performance and cost

Closely monitor the performance and cost of your clusters to ensure they're right-sized to meet the needs of your application and make adjustments as needed. You can use the following resources for monitoring:

[Identify high CPU usage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-high-cpu-consuming-containers-aks)[Troubleshoot memory saturation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-memory-saturation-aks)[Cost analysis add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cost-analysis)[Configure the Metrics Server Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)

## When to resize a cluster

You might want to resize a cluster in scenarios such as the following:

- If you see that CPU and memory usage is consistently low, consider
*downsizing*the cluster. If usage is consistently high, make sure you have[autoscaling enabled](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster)and increase the maximum node count if necessary. - The
[cost analysis add-on for AKS](cost-analysis)shows you details about node usage and cost that indicate you might benefit from cluster resizing. For example, if you see that your nodes have a*high idle cost*with a*low usage cost*, you might consider resizing your cluster to reduce costs. - The
[Metrics Server VPA](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)shows you that your requests and/or limits are too high or low based on historical usage. You can use this information to adjust your cluster size to better match your workload. - You experience performance issues such as resource starvation. This might be a result of the cluster being undersized for the demands of your applications.

## What happens when I resize a cluster?

### Increasing cluster size

You can increase the size of an AKS cluster by adding nodes to the cluster. You can [add nodes to the cluster manually](scale-cluster) or [configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster) in response to changing demands.

When you increase the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- New node instances are created using the same configuration as the existing nodes in the cluster.
- New pods might be scheduled on the new nodes to distribute the workload across the cluster.
- Existing pods don't move to the new nodes unless they are rescheduled due to node failures or other reasons.

### Decreasing cluster size

You can decrease the size of an AKS cluster by removing nodes from the cluster. When you remove nodes from the cluster, the nodes are automatically drained and removed from the cluster. You can remove nodes from the cluster manually or configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

When you decrease the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- AKS gracefully terminates the nodes and drains the pods running on the nodes before removing the nodes from the cluster.
- Any pods managed by a replication controller are rescheduled on other node instances in the cluster.
- Any pods that aren't managed by a replication controller aren't restarted.

## Manually resize an AKS cluster

- Resize an AKS cluster using the
command with the`az aks scale`

`--node-count`

and`--nodepool-name`

parameters.

Before running the resize command, set the required environment variables with your own values. The example values should be substituted with your actual resource group, cluster, desired node count, and node pool name.

```
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count $NUM_NODES --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL_NAME
```


Results:

```
{
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 4,
"maxCount": null,
"minCount": null,
"name": "nodepool1",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "xxxxx",
"fqdn": "xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
...
}
```


Repeat this command for each node pool in the cluster that you want to resize. If your cluster has only one node pool, you can omit the `--nodepool-name`

parameter.

## Automatically resize an AKS cluster

Use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) to automatically resize your node pools in response to changing demands.

For more information, see the [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview). To configure cluster autoscaling in AKS, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article outlines the support policy for the Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Versioning and support policy

### Service mesh add-on release calendar

The Istio-based service mesh add-on release calendar indicates each revision's AKS compatibility and estimated release and deprecation dates.

New minor revisions and patches are rolled out as part of AKS releases. Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To see real-time updates of regional release status and AKS release notes containing updates about Istio revision support, visit the [AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

| Service mesh revision | Upstream release | AKS release | End of life | Compatible AKS versions | Compatible AKS LTS versions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| asm-1-17 | Feb 2023 | Apr 2023 | Jan 2024 | 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 | |
| asm-1-18 | Jun 2023 | Nov 2023 | Feb 2024 | 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 | |

If using an AKS [long term-support (LTS) cluster](long-term-support), a newer revision may be declared as compatible when a previous compatible Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version's end of life. For more details, read Istio's [AKS compatibility policy](#aks-compatibility).

### Supported revisions

**Minor revision**:- At any given time, at least two revisions of the Istio-based service mesh add-on are supported.
- An older revision
`n-2`

will continue to be supported until six weeks after the newest revision`n`

starts rolling out to all regions. For example, if`asm-1-22`

just started rolling out to all regions,`asm-1-20`

will be deprecated after six weeks. - Deprecation means no new mesh installations can be done with this revision. While clusters already having this revision continue to work, for support issues and security patches, it's recommended to
[upgrade to a newer supported mesh revision](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade).

**Patch version**:- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then
[upgrade istio-proxy sidecars by restarting their workloads](istio-upgrade#patch-version-upgrade). - AKS reserves the right to deprecate patches if a critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) or security vulnerability is detected. For awareness on patch availability and any ad-hoc deprecation, refer to
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases)and visit the[AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then

### Default revision

If a revision isn't explicitly provided by user during installation, the `n-1`

revision is installed by default. For example, if `asm-1-22`

is the latest revision, the default is `asm-1-21`

.

### AKS compatibility

Each revision of the add-on is compatible with a set of AKS minor versions established by the [upstream Istio support and release calendar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases).

**AKS LTS clusters may be compatible with additional revisions beyond upstream Istio's support table.** For Istio revisions `asm-1-25`

+ and AKS LTS versions 1.28+, every supported AKS LTS version will have *at least one* compatible Istio revision.

To check the compatible AKS versions for an Istio revision, use the command [ az aks mesh get-revisions](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions):

```
az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table
```


This command has been updated to include separate `CompatibleWith`

outputs for `KubernetesOfficial`

(standard tier) and `AKSLongTermSupport`

, replacing the earlier response that only included `kubernetes`

(standard tier).

If using the Azure portal to enable the Istio add-on for an existing cluster, the available Istio revisions will be filtered based on the cluster's tier.

Each Istio add-on revision follows upstream lifecycle for end of life and patch availability. This means:

Every Istio revision will not be compatible with every AKS LTS version, but every AKS LTS version will be compatible with at least one Istio add-on revision.

If an Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version it is compatible with, a newer revision will be declared compatible with that LTS version. The add-on will need to be upgraded to stay in support.

For example, if

`asm-1-26`

is compatible with AKS LTS 1.28, and`asm-1-26`

reaches end of life,`asm-1-27`

may become compatible with 1.28 LTS instead.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked customizations

The Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS designates features and [configuration options](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values) as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

.

**Blocked**: Disallowed features and configuration options are blocked via add-on managed admission webhooks. The API server immediately publishes the error message to the user that the feature is disallowed.**Supported**: Supported features receive support from Azure support.**Allowed**: Allowed features are open and available to Istio add-on users but aren't covered by Azure support.

# Configure the Dapr extension for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Arc-enabled Kubernetes project

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

After [completing the prerequisites for installing the Dapr extension](dapr), you can configure the [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) extension to work best for you and your project using various configuration options, like:

- Rotating expiring certificates
- Provisioning Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled
- Limiting which of your nodes use the Dapr extension
- Setting automatic custom resource definition (CRD) updates
- Configuring the Dapr release namespace

The extension enables you to set Dapr configuration options by using the `--configuration-settings`

parameter in the Azure CLI or `configurationSettings`

property in a Bicep template.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Update configuration settings

Important

Some configuration options cannot be modified post-creation. Adjustments to these options require deletion and recreation of the extension, applicable to the following settings:

`global.ha.*`

`dapr_placement.*`


HA is enabled by default. Disabling it requires deletion and recreation of the extension.

To update your Dapr configuration settings, recreate the extension with the desired state. For example, let's say you previously created and installed the extension using the following configuration:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2"
```


To update the `dapr_operator.replicaCount`

from two to three, use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=3"
```


## Manage mTLS certificates

The Dapr extension supports in-transit encryption of communication between Dapr instances using the Dapr Sentry service control plane, which is a central Certificate Authority (CA). With the Sentry service, you can encrypt communication using self-signed or user-supplied x.509 certificates. [Learn more about setting up mTLS certificates in the open-source Dapr documentation.](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates)

You can [bring in your own certificates](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#bringing-your-own-certificates), or let [Dapr automatically create and persist self-signed root and issuer certificates](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates).

Important

If you don't explicitly configure certificates, [Dapr defaults to generating self-signed certificates](#manage-dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates), which are generally valid for 1 year. **Currently, using self-signed certificates generated by Dapr is not recommended.** Best practice is to generate custom certificates and update them manually.

### Manage Dapr-generated self-signed certificates

If you haven't provided any custom certificates, Dapr automatically creates and persists self-signed certificates, valid for 1 year. The Dapr extension installs the `dapr-trust-bundle`

secret, which contains certificate information under the default `dapr-system`

namespace.

#### Check expiry of current Dapr-generated self-signed certificates

You can check when the Dapr root certificate of your Kubernetes cluster expires by using [the Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/).

```
dapr mtls expiry
```


**Expected output:**

```
Root certificate expires in 8759 hours. Expiry date: 2025-12-06 18:14:20 +0000 UTC
```


You can also find the expiration date for your current certificate in the Kubernetes `dapr-trust-bundle`

secret data.

```
kubectl get secret dapr-trust-bundle -n dapr-system -o jsonpath='{.data.issuer\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```


**Expected output:**

```
notBefore=Dec 6 17:59:20 2024 GMT
notAfter=Dec 6 18:14:20 2025 GMT
```


#### Generate a new Dapr-generated self-signed certificate

**Via the Dapr CLI (recommended)**

Refer to Dapr's[Root and issuer certificate upgrade using CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#root-and-issuer-certificate-upgrade-using-cli-recommended)guide.**Via**Refer to Dapr's`kubectl`

commands[Updating root or issuer certs using Kubectl](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#updating-root-or-issuer-certs-using-kubectl)guide.

### Manage your own user-supplied x.509 certificates

You can also bring your own custom certificates.

**Generate custom certificates**

Create your own custom certificate; for example,[an Azure Key Vault certificate](/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/certificate-scenarios).**Update your custom certficate manually**

Follow[the instructions provided in the Dapr open source documentation to update your custom certificates manually](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#custom-certificates-bring-your-own)using.`kubectl`


## Provision Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled

Provision Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled by setting the `global.ha.enabled`

parameter to `true`

.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2"
```


Note

If configuration settings are sensitive and need to be protected (for example, cert-related information), pass the `--configuration-protected-settings`

parameter and the value will be protected from being read.

If no configuration-settings are passed, the Dapr configuration defaults to:

```
ha:
enabled: true
replicaCount: 3
disruption:
minimumAvailable: ""
maximumUnavailable: "25%"
prometheus:
enabled: true
port: 9090
mtls:
enabled: true
workloadCertTTL: 24h
allowedClockSkew: 15m
```


For a list of available options, see [Dapr configuration](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/master/charts/dapr/README.md#configuration).

## Limit the extension to certain nodes

In some configurations, you may only want to run Dapr on certain nodes. You can limit the extension by passing a `nodeSelector`

in the extension configuration. If the desired `nodeSelector`

contains `.`

, you must escape them from the shell and the extension. For example, the following configuration installs Dapr only to nodes with `topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "us-east-1c"`

:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2" \
--configuration-settings "global.nodeSelector.kubernetes\.io/zone=us-east-1c"
```


For managing OS and architecture, use the [supported versions](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/b8ae13bf3f0a84c25051fcdacbfd8ac8e32695df/docker/docker.mk#L50) of the `global.daprControlPlaneOs`

and `global.daprControlPlaneArch`

configuration:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2" \
--configuration-settings "global.daprControlPlaneOs=linux" \
--configuration-settings "global.daprControlPlaneArch=amd64"
```


## Install Dapr in multiple availability zones while in HA mode

By default, the placement service uses a storage class of type `standard_LRS`

. It's recommended to create a **zone redundant storage class** while installing Dapr in HA mode across multiple availability zones. For example, to create a `zrs`

type storage class, add the `storageaccounttype`

parameter:

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: custom-zone-redundant-storage
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
parameters:
storageaccounttype: Premium_ZRS
```


When installing Dapr, use the storage class you used in the YAML file:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters
--cluster-name XXX
--resource-group XXX
--name XXX
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr
--auto-upgrade-minor-version XXX
--version XXX
--configuration-settings "dapr_placement.volumeclaims.storageClassName=custom-zone-redundant-storage"
```


## Configure the Dapr release namespace

You can configure the release namespace.

The Dapr extension gets installed in the `dapr-system`

namespace by default. To override it, use `--release-namespace`

. To redefine the namespace, include the cluster `--scope`

.

```
az k8s-extension create \
--cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name dapr-aks \
--resource-group dapr-rg \
--name my-dapr-ext \
--extension-type microsoft.dapr \
--release-train stable \
--auto-upgrade false \
--version 1.9.2 \
--scope cluster \
--release-namespace dapr-custom
```


## Show current configuration settings

Use the `az k8s-extension show`

command to show the current Dapr configuration settings:

```
az k8s-extension show --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr
```


## Set Dapr monitoring log levels

You can configure settings for the Dapr monitoring component with your AKS cluster extension. For exmaple, to update `dapr_monitoring`

log levels to "warn" (only notified when receiving a warning or error), set the following `configuration-settings`

:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_monitoring.logLevel=warn"
```


## Set the outbound proxy for Dapr extension for Azure Arc on-premises

If you want to use an outbound proxy with the Dapr extension for AKS, you can do so by:

- Setting the proxy environment variables using the
:`dapr.io/env`

annotations`HTTP_PROXY`

`HTTPS_PROXY`

`NO_PROXY`


[Installing the proxy certificate in the sidecar](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/install-certificates/).

## Updating your Dapr installation version

If you are on a specific Dapr version and you don't have `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

available, you can use the following command to upgrade or downgrade Dapr:

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--version 1.12.0 # Version to upgrade or downgrade to
```


The preceding command updates the Dapr control plane *only.* To update the Dapr sidecars, restart your application deployments:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
```


## Using Azure Linux-based images

From Dapr version 1.8.0, you can use Azure Linux images with the Dapr extension. To use them, set the `global.tag`

flag:

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--set global.tag=1.10.0-mariner
```


[Learn more about using Mariner-based images with Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/#using-mariner-based-images).[Learn more about deploying Azure Linux on AKS](cluster-configuration#azure-linux-container-host-for-aks).

## Disable automatic CRD updates

From Dapr version 1.9.2, CRDs are automatically upgraded when the extension upgrades. To disable this setting, you can set `hooks.applyCrds`

to `false`

.

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--configuration-settings "hooks.applyCrds=false"
```


Note

CRDs are only applied in case of upgrades and are skipped during downgrades.

## Meet network requirements

The Dapr extension requires the following outbound URLs on `https://:443`

to function on AKS and Arc for Kubernetes:

`https://mcr.microsoft.com/daprio`

URL for pulling Dapr artifacts.- The
[outbound URLs required for AKS or Arc for Kubernetes](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/network-requirements).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

The AKS scheduling mechanism is responsible for placing pods onto nodes and is based upon the upstream Kubernetes scheduler, [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/). You can constrain a pod to run on particular nodes by attaching the pods to a set of nodes using [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or by instructing the node to repel a set of pods using [node taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/), which interact with the AKS scheduler.

Node taints work by marking a node so that the scheduler avoids placing certain pods on the marked nodes. You can place [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) on a pod to allow the scheduler to schedule that pod on a node with a matching taint. Taints and tolerations work together to help you control how the scheduler places pods onto nodes. For more information, see [example use cases of taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases:%7E:text=not%20be%20evicted.-,Example%20Use%20Cases,-Taints%20and%20tolerations).

Taints are key-value pairs with an [effect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/). There are three values for the effect field when using node taints: `NoExecute`

, `NoSchedule`

, and `PreferNoSchedule`

.

`NoExecute`

: Pods already running on the node are immediately evicted if they don't have a matching toleration. If a pod has a matching toleration, it might be evicted if`tolerationSeconds`

are specified.`NoSchedule`

: Only pods with a matching toleration are placed on this node. Existing pods aren't evicted.`PreferNoSchedule`

: The scheduler avoids placing any pods that don't have a matching toleration.

### Node taint options

There are two types of node taints that can be applied to your AKS nodes: **node taints** and **node initialization taints**.

**Node taints**are meant to remain permanently on the node for scheduling pods with node affinity. Node taints can only be added, updated, or removed completely using the AKS API.**Node initialization taints**are placed on the node at boot time and are meant to be used temporarily, such as in scenarios where you might need extra time to set up your nodes. You can remove node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API and they aren't guaranteed during the node lifecycle. They will appear on new replicas of the node when it is scaled up or on all replicas when a node is upgraded. If you want to remove the initialization taints completely, you can remove them using the AKS API after untainting the nodes using the Kubernetes API. Once you remove the initialization taints from the cluster spec using the AKS API, newly created nodes don't come up with those initialization taints. If the initialization taint is still present on existing nodes, you can permanently remove it by performing a node image upgrade operation.

Note

Node taints and labels applied using the AKS node pool API aren't modifiable from the Kubernetes API and vice versa. Modifications to system taints aren't allowed.

This doesn't apply to node initialization taints.

## Use node taints

### Prerequisites

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a node pool with a node taint

Create a node pool with a taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool add`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


### Update a node pool to add a node taint

Update a node pool to add a node taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool update`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


## Use node initialization taints (preview)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Prerequisites and limitations

- You need the Azure CLI version
`3.0.0b3`

or later installed and configured. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can only apply initialization taints via cluster create or upgrade when using the AKS API. If using ARM template that will result in a Managed Cluster level operation, you can specify node initialization taints during node pool creation and update. Agentpool level operations are blocked when
`NodeInitializationTaints`

are present in the request body. - You can't apply initialization taints to Windows node pools using the Azure CLI.

### Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a cluster with a node initialization taint

Create a cluster with a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks create`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

The node initialization taints you specify apply to all of the node pools in the cluster. To apply the initialization taint to a specific node, you can use an ARM template instead of the CLI.

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint

Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

When updating a cluster with a node initialization taint, the taints apply to all node pools in the cluster. If your nodes are using VMSS, you can view updates to node initialization taints on the node after the node's VMSS model is updated (for example, after a node image version upgrade operation). Initialization taints will not appear on your nodes until an operation that triggers a VMSS model update occurs.

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`


## Check the status of the node pool

After applying the node taint or initialization taint, check the status of the node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`

If you applied node initialization taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeInitializationTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeInitializationTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`


## Check that the taint is set on the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool has the specified`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: sku=gpu:NoSchedule ... ], ... ... ]`


Important

If your nodes are using VMSS, node initialization taints will not be visible on actual nodes in your cluster until an operation that triggers VMSS model update occurs (for example, Kubernetes version upgrade or node image version upgrade).

## Remove node taints

### Remove a specific node taint

Remove node taints using the

command. The following example command removes the`az aks nodepool update`

`"sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`

node taint from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


### Remove all node taints

Remove all node taints from a node pool using the

command. The following example command removes all node taints from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


## Remove node initialization taints

You have the following options to remove node initialization taints from the node:

**Remove node initialization taints temporarily**using the Kubernetes API. If you remove them this way, the taints reappear after node scaling or upgrade occurs. New nodes still have the node initialization taint after scaling. Node initialization taints appear on all nodes after upgrading.**Remove node initialization taints permanently**by untainting the node using the Kubernetes API, and then removing the taint using the AKS API. Once the initialization taints are removed from cluster spec using AKS API, newly created nodes after reimage operations no longer have initialization taints.

When you remove all initialization taint occurrences from node pool replicas, the existing initialization taint might reappear after an upgrade with any new initialization taints.

### Remove node initialization taints temporarily

Remove node initialization taints temporarily using the

`kubectl taint nodes`

command.This command removes the taint from only the specified node. If you want to remove the taint from every node in the node pool, you need to run the command for every node that you want the taint removed from.

`kubectl taint nodes $NODE_POOL_NAME sku=gpu:NoSchedule-`

Once removed, node initialization taints reappear after node scaling or upgrading occurs.


### Remove node initialization taints permanently

Follow steps in

[Remove node initialization taints temporarily](#remove-node-initialization-taints-temporarily)to remove the node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API.Remove the taint from the node using the AKS API using the

command. This command removes the node initialization taint from every node in the cluster.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints ""`


## Check that the taint has been removed from the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you removed a node taint, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool doesn't have the removed taint under`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: ... ], ... ... ]`

# Enable Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 is a US government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information technology products and systems. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to create Linux and Windows node pools with FIPS 140-2 enabled. Deployments running on FIPS-enabled node pools can use those cryptographic modules to provide increased security and help meet security controls as part of FedRAMP compliance. For more information on FIPS 140-2, see [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140](/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fips-140-2).

Caution

In this article, there are references to a feature that may be using Ubuntu OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS.

- Starting on March 17, 2027, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools.
[Upgrade your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to kubernetes version 1.35+ to migrate to a supported Ubuntu version. For more information on this retirement, see[AKS GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues)

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.32.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run `az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Note

AKS Monitoring Addon supports FIPS enabled node pools with Ubuntu, Azure Linux, and Windows starting with Agent version 3.1.17 (Linux) and Win-3.1.17 (Windows).

## Limitations

- FIPS-enabled node pools have the following limitations:
- FIPS-enabled node pools require Kubernetes version 1.19 and greater.
- To update the underlying packages or modules used for FIPS, you must use
[Node Image Upgrade](node-image-upgrade). - Container images on the FIPS nodes aren't assessed for FIPS compliance.
- Mounting of a CIFS share fails because FIPS disables some authentication modules. To work around this issue, see
[Errors when mounting a file share on a FIPS-enabled node pool](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share#fipsnodepool). - FIPS-enabled node pools with
[Arm64 VMs](use-arm64-vms)are only supported with Azure Linux 3.0+. - FIPS isn't supported with
[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).


Important

The FIPS-enabled Linux image is a different image than the default Linux image used for Linux-based node pools.

FIPS-enabled node images can have different version numbers, such as kernel version, than images that aren't FIPS-enabled. The update cycle for FIPS-enabled node pools and node images can differ from node pools and images that aren't FIPS-enabled.

## Supported OS Versions

You can create FIPS-enabled node pools on all supported OS types (Linux and Windows). However, not all OS versions support FIPS-enabled node pools. After a new OS version is released, there's typically a waiting period before it's FIPS compliant.

This table includes the supported OS versions:

| OS Type | OS SKU | FIPS Compliance |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | Supported |
| Linux | Azure Linux | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2019 | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2022 | Supported |

When requesting FIPS enabled Ubuntu, if the default Ubuntu version doesn't support FIPS, AKS defaults to the most recent FIPS-supported version of Ubuntu. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Linux node pools. Since 22.04 doesn't currently support FIPS, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 20.04 for Linux FIPS-enabled node pools.

Note

Previously, you could use the GetOSOptions API to determine whether a given OS supported FIPS. The GetOSOptions API is now deprecated and it will no longer be included in new AKS API versions starting with 2024-05-01.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image`

Note

You can also use the

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter with the[az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)command when creating a cluster to enable FIPS on the default node pool. When adding node pools to a cluster created in this way, you still must use the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter when adding node pools to create a FIPS-enabled node pool.Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows the

*fipsnp*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ fipsnp True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-fipsnp`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter. Unlike Linux-based node pools, Windows node pools share the same image set.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image \ --os-type Windows`

Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

Verify Windows node pools have access to the FIPS cryptographic libraries by

[creating an RDP connection to a Windows node](rdp)in a FIPS-enabled node pool and check the registry. From the**Run**application, enter`regedit`

.Look for

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy`

in the registry.If

`Enabled`

is set to*1*, then FIPS is enabled.FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Update an existing node pool to enable or disable FIPS

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable or disable FIPS. If you're planning to migrate your node pools from non-FIPS to FIPS, first validate that your application is working properly in a test environment before migrating it to a production environment. Validating your application in a test environment should prevent issues caused by the FIPS kernel blocking some weak cipher or encryption algorithm, such as an MD4 algorithm that isn't FIPS compliant.

Note

When updating an existing Linux node pool to enable or disable FIPS, the node pool update moves between the fips and non-fips image. This node pool update triggers a reimage to complete the update. This can cause the node pool update to take a few minutes to complete.

### Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.64.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Enable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable FIPS. When you update an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current image to the recommended FIPS image of the same OS SKU.

Update a node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-np`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-np-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Disable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to disable FIPS. When updating an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current FIPS image to the recommended non-FIPS image of the same OS SKU. The node image change will occur after a reimage.

Update a Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--disable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --disable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool isn't FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool isn't FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np False nodepool1 False`


## Message of the Day

Pass the `--message-of-the-day`

flag with the location of the file to replace the Message of the Day on Linux nodes at cluster creation or node pool creation.

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Onboard custom models for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As an AI engineer or developer, you might have to prototype and deploy AI workloads with a range of different model weights. AKS provides the option to deploy inferencing workloads using open-source presets supported out-of-box and managed in the KAITO [model registry](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets) or to dynamically download from the [HuggingFace registry](https://huggingface.co/models) at runtime onto your AKS cluster.

In this article, you learn how to onboard a sample HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on without having to manage custom images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an account, you can

[create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).An AKS cluster with the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled. For more information, see

[Enable KAITO on an AKS cluster](ai-toolchain-operator#enable-the-ai-toolchain-operator-add-on-on-an-aks-cluster).This example deployment requires quota for the

`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

virtual machine (VM) family in your Azure subscription. If you don't have quota for this VM family, please[request a quota increase](/en-us/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal).Note

Currently, only the HuggingFace runtime supports inference with the KAITO custom model deployment template.


## Choose an open-source language model from HuggingFace

In this example, we use the [BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7) small language model. Alternatively, you can choose from thousands of text-generation models supported on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>`

Clone the KAITO project GitHub repository using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito.git`


## Deploy your model inferencing workload using the KAITO workspace template

Navigate to the

`kaito`

directory and copy the[sample deployment YAML](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/examples/custom-model-integration/custom-model-deployment.yaml)manifest. Replace the default values in the following fields with your model's requirements. For this example, we specify the**bloom-1b7**HuggingFace model ID for[BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7)model:`instanceType`

: The minimum VM size for this inference service deployment is`Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4`

. For larger model sizes you can choose a VM in thefamily with higher memory capacity.`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

`MODEL_ID`

: Replace with your model's specific HuggingFace identifier, which can be found after`https://huggingface.co/`

in the model card URL.`"--torch_dtype"`

: Set to`"float16"`

for compatibility with V100 GPUs. For A100, H100 or newer GPUs, use`"bfloat16"`

.- (Optional)
`HF_TOKEN`

: Specify the values in this section only if you are deploying a private or gated Hugging Face model for inference.

`apiVersion: kaito.sh/v1beta1 kind: Workspace metadata: name: workspace-custom-llm resource: instanceType: "Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4" # Replace with the required VM SKU based on model requirements labelSelector: matchLabels: apps: custom-llm inference: template: spec: containers: - name: custom-llm-container image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/kaito/kaito-base:0.0.8 # KAITO base image which includes hf runtime livenessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 600 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 readinessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 30 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 resources: requests: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Request 1 GPU; adjust as needed limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Optional: Limit to 1 GPU command: - "accelerate" args: - "launch" - "--num_processes" - "1" - "--num_machines" - "1" - "--gpu_ids" - "all" - "tfs/inference_api.py" - "--pipeline" - "text-generation" - "--trust_remote_code" - "--allow_remote_files" - "--pretrained_model_name_or_path" - "bloom-1b7" - "--torch_dtype" - "bfloat16" # env: # HF_TOKEN is required only for private or gated Hugging Face models # Uncomment and configure this block if needed # - name: HF_TOKEN # valueFrom: # secretKeyRef: # name: hf-token-secret # Replace with your Kubernetes Secret name # key: HF_TOKEN # Replace with the specific key holding the token volumeMounts: - name: dshm mountPath: /dev/shm volumes: - name: dshm emptyDir: medium: Memory`

Save these changes to your

`custom-model-deployment.yaml`

file.Run the deployment in your AKS cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f custom-model-deployment.yaml`


## Test your custom model inferencing service

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace using the

`kubectl get workspace`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace-custom-llm -w`

Note

Note that machine readiness can take

*up to 10 minutes*, and workspace readiness*up to 20 minutes*.Check your language model inference service and get the service IP address using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-custom-llm -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')`

Test your custom model inference service with a sample input of your choice using the

[OpenAI API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat):`kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never curl --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -X POST http://$SERVICE_IP/v1/completions \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "bloom-1b7", "prompt": "What sport should I play in rainy weather?", "max_tokens": 20 }'`


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring extra Azure compute charges.

Delete the KAITO inference workspace using the `kubectl delete workspace`

command.

```
kubectl delete workspace workspace-custom-llm
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to onboard a HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on directly to your AKS cluster. To learn more about AI and machine learning on AKS, see the following articles:

# Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to resize an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It's important to right-size your clusters to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

## Cluster right-sizing

When you create an AKS cluster, you specify the number of nodes and the size of the nodes, which determines the compute capacity of the cluster. Oversized clusters can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersized clusters can lead to performance issues. You can adjust the number and size of the nodes in the cluster to right-size the cluster to meet the needs of your applications.

Consider the following factors when right-sizing your cluster:

**Resource requirements**: Understand the resource requirements of your applications to determine the number of nodes and the size of the nodes needed to run your workloads.**Performance requirements**: Determine the performance requirements of your applications to ensure that the cluster can meet the demands of your workloads.**Cost considerations**: Optimize costs by right-sizing your cluster to avoid unnecessary costs associated with oversized clusters.**Application demands**: Monitor the demands of your applications to adjust the size of the cluster in response to changing demands.**Infrastructure constraints**: Consider the infrastructure constraints of your environment, such as capacity or reserved instance limiting to specific SKUs, to ensure that the cluster can be right-sized within the limits of your environment.

## Monitor cluster performance and cost

Closely monitor the performance and cost of your clusters to ensure they're right-sized to meet the needs of your application and make adjustments as needed. You can use the following resources for monitoring:

[Identify high CPU usage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-high-cpu-consuming-containers-aks)[Troubleshoot memory saturation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-memory-saturation-aks)[Cost analysis add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cost-analysis)[Configure the Metrics Server Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)

## When to resize a cluster

You might want to resize a cluster in scenarios such as the following:

- If you see that CPU and memory usage is consistently low, consider
*downsizing*the cluster. If usage is consistently high, make sure you have[autoscaling enabled](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster)and increase the maximum node count if necessary. - The
[cost analysis add-on for AKS](cost-analysis)shows you details about node usage and cost that indicate you might benefit from cluster resizing. For example, if you see that your nodes have a*high idle cost*with a*low usage cost*, you might consider resizing your cluster to reduce costs. - The
[Metrics Server VPA](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)shows you that your requests and/or limits are too high or low based on historical usage. You can use this information to adjust your cluster size to better match your workload. - You experience performance issues such as resource starvation. This might be a result of the cluster being undersized for the demands of your applications.

## What happens when I resize a cluster?

### Increasing cluster size

You can increase the size of an AKS cluster by adding nodes to the cluster. You can [add nodes to the cluster manually](scale-cluster) or [configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster) in response to changing demands.

When you increase the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- New node instances are created using the same configuration as the existing nodes in the cluster.
- New pods might be scheduled on the new nodes to distribute the workload across the cluster.
- Existing pods don't move to the new nodes unless they are rescheduled due to node failures or other reasons.

### Decreasing cluster size

You can decrease the size of an AKS cluster by removing nodes from the cluster. When you remove nodes from the cluster, the nodes are automatically drained and removed from the cluster. You can remove nodes from the cluster manually or configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

When you decrease the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- AKS gracefully terminates the nodes and drains the pods running on the nodes before removing the nodes from the cluster.
- Any pods managed by a replication controller are rescheduled on other node instances in the cluster.
- Any pods that aren't managed by a replication controller aren't restarted.

## Manually resize an AKS cluster

- Resize an AKS cluster using the
command with the`az aks scale`

`--node-count`

and`--nodepool-name`

parameters.

Before running the resize command, set the required environment variables with your own values. The example values should be substituted with your actual resource group, cluster, desired node count, and node pool name.

```
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count $NUM_NODES --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL_NAME
```


Results:

```
{
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 4,
"maxCount": null,
"minCount": null,
"name": "nodepool1",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "xxxxx",
"fqdn": "xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
...
}
```


Repeat this command for each node pool in the cluster that you want to resize. If your cluster has only one node pool, you can omit the `--nodepool-name`

parameter.

## Automatically resize an AKS cluster

Use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) to automatically resize your node pools in response to changing demands.

For more information, see the [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview). To configure cluster autoscaling in AKS, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

# Schedule and deploy batch jobs with Kueue on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to schedule and deploy sample batch jobs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kueue. Also, this guide covers installing Kueue, configuring ResourceFlavors and ClusterQueues for fine-grained resource management, and submitting jobs via LocalQueues. You also learn how to use Kueue to queue up a sample batch job and track the results across Pending, Running, and Finished states.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

To learn more about Kueue and common uses cases for batch workload administrators and users, see [Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview).

## Prerequisites

- An existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Azure CLI installed on your local machine. To install or upgrade, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Helm version 3 or above](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.[The latest version of Kueue installed in a dedicated namespace on your cluster](kueue-overview#prerequisites).

## Define a ResourceFlavor object

In Kueue, a ResourceFlavors enables fine-grained resource management by associating workloads with specific nodes, taints, tolerations, or availability zones. For nodes, `ResourceFlavors`

can define the characteristics like pricing, availability, brands, models, and architecture (that is, x86 versus ARM CPUs). A `ClusterQueue`

uses these flavors to manage quotas and admission policies for workloads.

This configuration defines a `ResourceFlavor`

without any labels or taints, known as an empty `ResourceFlavor`

. This configuration is perfect when quotas for different flavors don't need to be managed.

Create and save a

`ResourceFlavor`

in a file named`resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat << EOF > resourceflavor-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ResourceFlavor metadata: name: on-demand EOF`

apply

`kubectl apply -f resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

verify

`kubectl get resourceflavors`

Example output

`NAME AGE on-demand 5m32s`


## Create a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that governs a pool of resources, defining usage limits and Fair Sharing rules. Where applicable, Fair Sharing rules allow another ClusterQueue in the **same** cohort to unused quota for pending jobs. Each ClusterQueue specifies which flavors it supports and how much quota is available for each.

This sample `ClusterQueue`

defines:

: Indicates that`namespaceSelector: {}`

`sample-jobs`

accepts workloads from any namespace that references this`ClusterQueue`

via a`LocalQueue`

(you can restrict usage (for example, to only team A's namespace) with a label selector).: Defines the standard CPU and memory resource types managed by this`coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"]`

in`resourceGroups`

`ClusterQueue`

.: Only workloads scheduled on`flavor`

of`on-demand`

nodes with`4`

CPUs,`8Gi`

memory`on-demand`

nodes consume this quota. If the cluster uses up this quota, it doesn't admit any other workloads using this flavor (unless you allow borrowing from the`cohort`

).

Create and save a Kueue

`ClusterQueue`

in a file named`clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat <<EOF > clusterqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterQueue metadata: name: sample-jobs spec: cohort: general namespaceSelector: {} # Accept workloads from any namespace resourceGroups: - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"] flavors: - name: on-demand resources: - name: "cpu" nominalQuota: 4 - name: "memory" nominalQuota: 8Gi EOF`

Apply the

`ClusterQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the ClusterQueue` manifest was applied

`kubectl get clusterqueues`

Example output

`NAME COHORT PENDING WORKLOADS sample-jobs general 0`


Note

The `ClusterQueue`

isn't ready for use until a `ResourceFlavor`

object is configured. If you create a `ClusterQueue`

without any existing `ResourceFlavor`

, workloads referencing it are marked as `Inadmissible`

.

## Create a LocalQueue

A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs. A `LocalQueue`

is assigned to one `ClusterQueue`

from which resources are allocated to run its workloads.

This sample `LocalQueue`

configures the following settings:

- Enables users in the
`batch-jobs`

namespace to submit batch workloads to Kueue. - Route the batch workloads to the
`sample-jobs`

`ClusterQueue`

, which manages the actual compute resource quotas and scheduling policies.

Create a namespace named

*batch-jobs*using the`kubectl create`

command.`kubectl create ns batch-jobs`

Create and save a

`LocalQueue`

in a file named`localqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following YAML manifest:`cat <<EOF > localqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: LocalQueue metadata: name: sample-queue namespace: batch-jobs spec: clusterQueue: sample-jobs EOF`

Apply the

`LocalQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f localqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the

`LocalQueue`

manifest was applied`kubectl get localqueues --all-namespaces`

Exampmle output

`NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTERQUEUE PENDING WORKLOADS ADMITTED WORKLOADS batch-jobs sample-queue sample-jobs 0 0`


## Create 2 batch jobs

This configuration defines two Kubernetes batch jobs submitted to the batch-jobs namespace and assigned to the sample-queue managed by Kueue. Both jobs are single-instance (parallelism: 1, completions: 1) and are configured with `Never`

restart policy. The fields `parallelism`

and `completions`

control how many pods are run and how the job is considered complete. So `parallelism`

and `completions`

of 1 means that one pod can run at once, and the job is marked as complete once one pod finishes successfully, per batch job.

- Job test-batch-1: Requests one CPU and 500Mi memory
- Job test-batch-2: Requests two CPUs and 1Gi memory

Create two sample batch jobs to deploy in the

*batch-jobs*namespace using the following YAML manifest named`batch-workloads.yaml`

:`cat <<EOF > batch-workloads.yaml apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-1 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Running test-batch-1; sleep 60"] resources: requests: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" limits: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" restartPolicy: Never --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-2 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Waiting in queue for CPUs...; sleep 30"] resources: requests: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" limits: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" restartPolicy: Never EOF`

Apply the manifest for the batch jobs using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f batch-workloads.yaml`


## Verify Batch Jobs are Submitted to `LocalQueue`


View the status of the batched workloads using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get workloads --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME ADMITTED AGE test-batch-1 True 10s test-batch-2 False 5s`

Run the following command for

`test-batch-2`

while it is in a`Pending`

state`kubectl get workloads test-batch-2 -o yaml`

Expected output

`... ... Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: False Reason: QuotaUnavailable Message: Insufficient quota in ClusterQueue sample-jobs (flavor on-demand): requested 2 CPUs, available 1 ... ...`

After

`test-batch-1`

completes,`test-batch-2`

will be admitted and run.Now, the output should look like the following example output:

`Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: True Last Transition Time: 1234-56-78T00:00:00Z Admission: ClusterQueue: sample-jobs PodSetAssignments: Name: main Flavors: cpu: on-demand memory: on-demand ResourceUsage: cpu: 2 memory: 1Gi`

View the final status of the

`batch-jobs`

namespace using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get job,deploy,rs,pod,workload --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/test-batch-1 Complete 1/1 97s 3m15s job.batch/test-batch-2 Complete 1/1 35s 3m15s NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/test-batch-1-hb8zl 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s pod/test-batch-2-dx9hk 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-1-6fb85 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-2-84f49 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s`


## FAQ

### Question 1: How can I confirm that the Kueue controller is available and running as expected?

Confirm the Kueue controller manager pod is running using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get pods --namespace kueue-system`

The Kueue controller manager pod should be in a

`Running`

state with`1/1`

containers ready, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kueue-controller-manager-xxxxxxx 1/1 Running 0 2m`

If the

`Status`

shows`CrashLoopBackOff`

or`Pending`

, check the deployment logs using the`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs --namespace kueue-system deployment/kueue-controller-manager`


### Question 2: One or more of the Kueue custom resources (CRDs) are missing when I install via Helm. How can I ensure all of the CRDs are installed?

After installing Kueue with the

[Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview)guidance, confirm that all of the CRDs are installed using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get crds | grep kueue`

These CRDs should be listed, as shown in the following example output:

`admissionchecks.kueue.x-k8s.io clusterqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io cohorts.kueue.x-k8s.io localqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueclusters.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io provisioningrequestconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io resourceflavors.kueue.x-k8s.io topologies.kueue.x-k8s.io workloadpriorityclasses.kueue.x-k8s.io workloads.kueue.x-k8s.io`

If one or more of the CRDs are missing, you might see errors in controller logs, failed job queuing,

`CrashLoopBackOff`

for the controller, or inability to admit or schedule workloads. In this case, you can manually reinstall the Kueue CRDs using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/latest/download/kueue-crds.yaml`

Note

Note that if you manually install the CRDs, you need to manually delete them once you're finished using the

`kubectl delete`

command.

### Question 3: What's the difference between a LocalQueue and a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that defines and governs a pool of compute resources like CPU, memory, pods, and accelerators across the entire Kubernetes cluster. A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs within the defined Kubernetes cluster. This separation allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation and multi-tenant scheduling without exposing cluster-wide quotas directly to users.

How they work together:

- A user submits a job to a LocalQueue in their namespace.
- Kueue routes the job to the referenced ClusterQueue.
- The ClusterQueue checks resource availability and quota limits.
- If admitted, the job is unsuspended and scheduled.

## Next steps

In this article, you:

- Installed Kueue on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Helm and verified CRDs, controller health, and namespace setup.
- Configured
`ClusterQueue`

and`LocalQueue`

for general-purpose workloads with resource quotas and flavors (such as on-demand). - Submitted two batch jobs to demonstrate queuing: one admitted immediately, the second held due to quota limits, then admitted when resources became available.
- Monitored workload status and controller logs to confirm scheduling behavior and queuing logic.

To learn more about Kueue, visit the following resources:

[Multi-cluster scheduling and resource placement with Kueue and KubeFleet on AKS](https://blog.aks.azure.com/2025/04/02/Scaling-Kubernetes-for-AI-and-Data-intensive-Workloads).[Kueue developer tools](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/dev/)official documentation.

# Migrate Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pods from pod-managed identity to Microsoft Entra Workload ID

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Migrate AKS pods from pod-managed identities to [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview) (workload identity) using one of three approaches based on your current [Azure Identity SDK](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-v2-libraries) version: latest SDK parallel deployment, migration sidecar proxy (Linux only), or SDK rewrite.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. Run the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Set environment variables

The following table lists the environment variables used in the commands throughout this article. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.

| Environment variable | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`SUBSCRIPTION_ID` |
The ID of the Azure subscription where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |
`RESOURCE_GROUP` |
The name of the resource group where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `myResourceGroup` |
`LOCATION` |
The Azure region where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `eastus` |
`CLUSTER_NAME` |
The name of the AKS cluster. | `myAKSCluster` |
`MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the user-assigned managed identity. | `myManagedIdentity` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` |
The name of the Kubernetes service account to create or associate with the managed identity. | `workload-identity-sa` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE` |
The namespace of the Kubernetes service account. | `default` |
`FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the federated identity credential to create. | `myFederatedIdentity` |

## Choose a migration path

Select the appropriate migration approach based on your current Azure Identity SDK version:

**Latest Azure Identity SDK**: If your application already uses the latest version of Azure Identity SDK, you can migrate by deploying Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.**Older SDK with migration sidecar**- If your application uses an older SDK version and runs on Linux containers, you can use a temporary migration sidecar to proxy Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions while planning your SDK upgrade.**Older SDK rewrite approach**: If your application uses an older SDK version, you can update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to workload identity.

## Prepare for migration

For all migration paths, you need to have the federated trust set up before you update your application to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following are the minimum steps required:

[Create a managed identity](#create-a-managed-identity)credential.- Associate the user-assigned managed identity with the Kubernetes service account already used for the pod-managed identity or
[create a new Kubernetes service account](#create-kubernetes-service-account)and then associate it with the managed identity. [Establish a federated trust relationship](#establish-federated-identity-credential-trust)between the managed identity and Microsoft Entra ID using the[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)issuer URL and the service account.

## Migrate from latest version of Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application already uses the latest version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to migrate with minimal code changes.

**Migration approach**: Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with pod-managed identity, verify functionality, then remove pod-managed identity.

**Steps**:

- Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify the application can authenticate successfully using workload identity.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations from your application.- Remove the pod-managed identity add-on from your cluster.

## Use a migration sidecar (Linux containers only)

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK, runs on Linux containers, and you need a temporary solution while planning SDK updates.

**Migration approach**: Deploy a migration sidecar that proxies IMDS transactions to OIDC, allowing your existing application code to work without immediate changes.

**Important limitations**:

**Linux containers only**. Windows containers aren't supported.**Temporary solution**that's not intended for long-term production use.**Planning required**to schedule SDK updates for long-term support.

**Steps**:

[Deploy the workload with migration sidecar](#deploy-the-workload-with-migration-sidecar)to proxy IMDS transactions.- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
- Schedule application SDK updates to supported Azure Identity versions.
- Once SDKs are updated, remove the proxy sidecar and redeploy applications.

## Rewrite application for latest Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to update to the latest supported SDK before migrating.

**Migration approach**: Update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID with the updated code.

**Technical outcomes**:

- Uses current Azure Identity SDK versions (no deprecation timeline).
- Supports both Linux and Windows containers (unlike sidecar approach).
- Eliminates proxy components and IMDS translation overhead.

**Steps**:

- Update your application code to use the latest
[Azure Identity SDK](workload-identity-overview#prerequisites). - Test the updated application with pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin authenticating using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations and add-on.

## Set an active Azure subscription

Set a specific Azure subscription as the current active subscription using the

command.`az account set`

`az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Create a managed identity

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Get managed identity client ID

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'clientId' -otsv)"`


## Grant managed identity access to Azure resources

- Grant the managed identity the permissions needed to access the required Azure resources. Follow the steps in
[Assign a managed identity access to a resource](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)to assign the appropriate role to the managed identity.

## Get OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az aks show`

`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)"`

The variable should contain an issuer URL similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/`

By default, the issuer uses the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location the AKS cluster is deployed in. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key.

## Get AKS cluster credentials

Get the AKS cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`


## Create Kubernetes service account

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the managed identity client ID using the

`kubectl apply`

command. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`

The following output resembles successful creation of the identity:

`Serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Establish federated identity credential trust

Create the federated identity credential between the managed identity, service account issuer, and subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create --name $FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME --identity-name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

The federated identity credential takes a few minutes to propagate after being added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the token request might fail because the Azure AD directory cache contains outdated information.


## Deploy the workload with migration sidecar

If your application uses user-assigned managed identity and still relies on IMDS to get an access token you can use the migration sidecar to start migrating to Microsoft Entra Workload ID. In long-term applications, you should modify the code to use the latest Azure Identity SDKs that support client assertion.

To update or deploy the workload, add the following [pod annotations](workload-identity-overview#pod-annotations) to your pod specification (only if you want to use the migration sidecar):

| Pod annotation | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar` |
Indicates whether to inject the proxy sidecar into the pod. | `true` or `false` |
`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port` |
Desired port for the proxy sidecar. | Default value: `8000` |

When you create a pod with these annotations, the Microsoft Entra Workload ID mutating webhook automatically injects the `init-container`

and proxy sidecar to the pod spec. The following YAML shows an example of what the mutating webhook adds to the pod deployment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: httpbin-pod
labels:
app: httpbin
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
annotations:
azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar: "true"
spec:
serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
initContainers:
- name: init-networking
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy-init:v1.1.0
securityContext:
capabilities:
add:
- NET_ADMIN
drop:
- ALL
privileged: true
runAsUser: 0
env:
- name: PROXY_PORT
value: "8000"
containers:
- name: nginx
image: nginx:alpine
ports:
- containerPort: 80
- name: proxy
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy:v1.1.0
ports:
- containerPort: 8000
```


## Verify the workload with migration sidecar

Verify the pod is in a running state using the

command. Replace`kubectl describe pod`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl describe pods <pod-name>`

Verify the pod is passing IMDS transactions using the

command. Replace`kubectl logs`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl logs <pod-name>`

The following example log output resembles successful communication through the proxy sidecar. Verify the logs show a token is successfully acquired and the

`GET`

operation is successful.`I0926 00:29:29.968723 1 proxy.go:97] proxy "msg"="starting the proxy server" "port"=8080 "userAgent"="azure-workload-identity/proxy/v0.13.0-12-gc8527f3 (linux/amd64) c8527f3/2022-09-26-00:19" I0926 00:29:29.972496 1 proxy.go:173] proxy "msg"="received readyz request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/readyz" I0926 00:29:30.936769 1 proxy.go:107] proxy "msg"="received token request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>" I0926 00:29:31.101998 1 proxy.go:129] proxy "msg"="successfully acquired token" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>"`


## Remove pod-managed identity

After you complete your testing and the application can successfully get a token using the proxy sidecar, you can remove the identity and pod-managed identity mapping from your AKS cluster

Remove the pod-managed identity binding from your pod using the

command. Replace`az aks pod-identity delete`

`<pod-identity-name>`

and`<pod-identity-namespace>`

with the name and namespace of your pod identity.`az aks pod-identity delete --name <pod-identity-name> --namespace <pod-identity-namespace> --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

# Configure the Dapr extension for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Arc-enabled Kubernetes project

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

After [completing the prerequisites for installing the Dapr extension](dapr), you can configure the [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) extension to work best for you and your project using various configuration options, like:

- Rotating expiring certificates
- Provisioning Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled
- Limiting which of your nodes use the Dapr extension
- Setting automatic custom resource definition (CRD) updates
- Configuring the Dapr release namespace

The extension enables you to set Dapr configuration options by using the `--configuration-settings`

parameter in the Azure CLI or `configurationSettings`

property in a Bicep template.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Update configuration settings

Important

Some configuration options cannot be modified post-creation. Adjustments to these options require deletion and recreation of the extension, applicable to the following settings:

`global.ha.*`

`dapr_placement.*`


HA is enabled by default. Disabling it requires deletion and recreation of the extension.

To update your Dapr configuration settings, recreate the extension with the desired state. For example, let's say you previously created and installed the extension using the following configuration:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2"
```


To update the `dapr_operator.replicaCount`

from two to three, use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=3"
```


## Manage mTLS certificates

The Dapr extension supports in-transit encryption of communication between Dapr instances using the Dapr Sentry service control plane, which is a central Certificate Authority (CA). With the Sentry service, you can encrypt communication using self-signed or user-supplied x.509 certificates. [Learn more about setting up mTLS certificates in the open-source Dapr documentation.](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates)

You can [bring in your own certificates](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#bringing-your-own-certificates), or let [Dapr automatically create and persist self-signed root and issuer certificates](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates).

Important

If you don't explicitly configure certificates, [Dapr defaults to generating self-signed certificates](#manage-dapr-generated-self-signed-certificates), which are generally valid for 1 year. **Currently, using self-signed certificates generated by Dapr is not recommended.** Best practice is to generate custom certificates and update them manually.

### Manage Dapr-generated self-signed certificates

If you haven't provided any custom certificates, Dapr automatically creates and persists self-signed certificates, valid for 1 year. The Dapr extension installs the `dapr-trust-bundle`

secret, which contains certificate information under the default `dapr-system`

namespace.

#### Check expiry of current Dapr-generated self-signed certificates

You can check when the Dapr root certificate of your Kubernetes cluster expires by using [the Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/).

```
dapr mtls expiry
```


**Expected output:**

```
Root certificate expires in 8759 hours. Expiry date: 2025-12-06 18:14:20 +0000 UTC
```


You can also find the expiration date for your current certificate in the Kubernetes `dapr-trust-bundle`

secret data.

```
kubectl get secret dapr-trust-bundle -n dapr-system -o jsonpath='{.data.issuer\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -dates
```


**Expected output:**

```
notBefore=Dec 6 17:59:20 2024 GMT
notAfter=Dec 6 18:14:20 2025 GMT
```


#### Generate a new Dapr-generated self-signed certificate

**Via the Dapr CLI (recommended)**

Refer to Dapr's[Root and issuer certificate upgrade using CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#root-and-issuer-certificate-upgrade-using-cli-recommended)guide.**Via**Refer to Dapr's`kubectl`

commands[Updating root or issuer certs using Kubectl](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#updating-root-or-issuer-certs-using-kubectl)guide.

### Manage your own user-supplied x.509 certificates

You can also bring your own custom certificates.

**Generate custom certificates**

Create your own custom certificate; for example,[an Azure Key Vault certificate](/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/certificate-scenarios).**Update your custom certficate manually**

Follow[the instructions provided in the Dapr open source documentation to update your custom certificates manually](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/mtls/#custom-certificates-bring-your-own)using.`kubectl`


## Provision Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled

Provision Dapr with high availability (HA) enabled by setting the `global.ha.enabled`

parameter to `true`

.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2"
```


Note

If configuration settings are sensitive and need to be protected (for example, cert-related information), pass the `--configuration-protected-settings`

parameter and the value will be protected from being read.

If no configuration-settings are passed, the Dapr configuration defaults to:

```
ha:
enabled: true
replicaCount: 3
disruption:
minimumAvailable: ""
maximumUnavailable: "25%"
prometheus:
enabled: true
port: 9090
mtls:
enabled: true
workloadCertTTL: 24h
allowedClockSkew: 15m
```


For a list of available options, see [Dapr configuration](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/master/charts/dapr/README.md#configuration).

## Limit the extension to certain nodes

In some configurations, you may only want to run Dapr on certain nodes. You can limit the extension by passing a `nodeSelector`

in the extension configuration. If the desired `nodeSelector`

contains `.`

, you must escape them from the shell and the extension. For example, the following configuration installs Dapr only to nodes with `topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "us-east-1c"`

:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2" \
--configuration-settings "global.nodeSelector.kubernetes\.io/zone=us-east-1c"
```


For managing OS and architecture, use the [supported versions](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/b8ae13bf3f0a84c25051fcdacbfd8ac8e32695df/docker/docker.mk#L50) of the `global.daprControlPlaneOs`

and `global.daprControlPlaneArch`

configuration:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_operator.replicaCount=2" \
--configuration-settings "global.daprControlPlaneOs=linux" \
--configuration-settings "global.daprControlPlaneArch=amd64"
```


## Install Dapr in multiple availability zones while in HA mode

By default, the placement service uses a storage class of type `standard_LRS`

. It's recommended to create a **zone redundant storage class** while installing Dapr in HA mode across multiple availability zones. For example, to create a `zrs`

type storage class, add the `storageaccounttype`

parameter:

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: custom-zone-redundant-storage
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
parameters:
storageaccounttype: Premium_ZRS
```


When installing Dapr, use the storage class you used in the YAML file:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters
--cluster-name XXX
--resource-group XXX
--name XXX
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr
--auto-upgrade-minor-version XXX
--version XXX
--configuration-settings "dapr_placement.volumeclaims.storageClassName=custom-zone-redundant-storage"
```


## Configure the Dapr release namespace

You can configure the release namespace.

The Dapr extension gets installed in the `dapr-system`

namespace by default. To override it, use `--release-namespace`

. To redefine the namespace, include the cluster `--scope`

.

```
az k8s-extension create \
--cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name dapr-aks \
--resource-group dapr-rg \
--name my-dapr-ext \
--extension-type microsoft.dapr \
--release-train stable \
--auto-upgrade false \
--version 1.9.2 \
--scope cluster \
--release-namespace dapr-custom
```


## Show current configuration settings

Use the `az k8s-extension show`

command to show the current Dapr configuration settings:

```
az k8s-extension show --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr
```


## Set Dapr monitoring log levels

You can configure settings for the Dapr monitoring component with your AKS cluster extension. For exmaple, to update `dapr_monitoring`

log levels to "warn" (only notified when receiving a warning or error), set the following `configuration-settings`

:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version true \
--configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \
--configuration-settings "dapr_monitoring.logLevel=warn"
```


## Set the outbound proxy for Dapr extension for Azure Arc on-premises

If you want to use an outbound proxy with the Dapr extension for AKS, you can do so by:

- Setting the proxy environment variables using the
:`dapr.io/env`

annotations`HTTP_PROXY`

`HTTPS_PROXY`

`NO_PROXY`


[Installing the proxy certificate in the sidecar](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/install-certificates/).

## Updating your Dapr installation version

If you are on a specific Dapr version and you don't have `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

available, you can use the following command to upgrade or downgrade Dapr:

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--version 1.12.0 # Version to upgrade or downgrade to
```


The preceding command updates the Dapr control plane *only.* To update the Dapr sidecars, restart your application deployments:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
```


## Using Azure Linux-based images

From Dapr version 1.8.0, you can use Azure Linux images with the Dapr extension. To use them, set the `global.tag`

flag:

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--set global.tag=1.10.0-mariner
```


[Learn more about using Mariner-based images with Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/#using-mariner-based-images).[Learn more about deploying Azure Linux on AKS](cluster-configuration#azure-linux-container-host-for-aks).

## Disable automatic CRD updates

From Dapr version 1.9.2, CRDs are automatically upgraded when the extension upgrades. To disable this setting, you can set `hooks.applyCrds`

to `false`

.

```
az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name dapr \
--configuration-settings "hooks.applyCrds=false"
```


Note

CRDs are only applied in case of upgrades and are skipped during downgrades.

## Meet network requirements

The Dapr extension requires the following outbound URLs on `https://:443`

to function on AKS and Arc for Kubernetes:

`https://mcr.microsoft.com/daprio`

URL for pulling Dapr artifacts.- The
[outbound URLs required for AKS or Arc for Kubernetes](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/network-requirements).

# Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

The AKS scheduling mechanism is responsible for placing pods onto nodes and is based upon the upstream Kubernetes scheduler, [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/). You can constrain a pod to run on particular nodes by attaching the pods to a set of nodes using [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or by instructing the node to repel a set of pods using [node taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/), which interact with the AKS scheduler.

Node taints work by marking a node so that the scheduler avoids placing certain pods on the marked nodes. You can place [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) on a pod to allow the scheduler to schedule that pod on a node with a matching taint. Taints and tolerations work together to help you control how the scheduler places pods onto nodes. For more information, see [example use cases of taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases:%7E:text=not%20be%20evicted.-,Example%20Use%20Cases,-Taints%20and%20tolerations).

Taints are key-value pairs with an [effect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/). There are three values for the effect field when using node taints: `NoExecute`

, `NoSchedule`

, and `PreferNoSchedule`

.

`NoExecute`

: Pods already running on the node are immediately evicted if they don't have a matching toleration. If a pod has a matching toleration, it might be evicted if`tolerationSeconds`

are specified.`NoSchedule`

: Only pods with a matching toleration are placed on this node. Existing pods aren't evicted.`PreferNoSchedule`

: The scheduler avoids placing any pods that don't have a matching toleration.

### Node taint options

There are two types of node taints that can be applied to your AKS nodes: **node taints** and **node initialization taints**.

**Node taints**are meant to remain permanently on the node for scheduling pods with node affinity. Node taints can only be added, updated, or removed completely using the AKS API.**Node initialization taints**are placed on the node at boot time and are meant to be used temporarily, such as in scenarios where you might need extra time to set up your nodes. You can remove node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API and they aren't guaranteed during the node lifecycle. They will appear on new replicas of the node when it is scaled up or on all replicas when a node is upgraded. If you want to remove the initialization taints completely, you can remove them using the AKS API after untainting the nodes using the Kubernetes API. Once you remove the initialization taints from the cluster spec using the AKS API, newly created nodes don't come up with those initialization taints. If the initialization taint is still present on existing nodes, you can permanently remove it by performing a node image upgrade operation.

Note

Node taints and labels applied using the AKS node pool API aren't modifiable from the Kubernetes API and vice versa. Modifications to system taints aren't allowed.

This doesn't apply to node initialization taints.

## Use node taints

### Prerequisites

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a node pool with a node taint

Create a node pool with a taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool add`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


### Update a node pool to add a node taint

Update a node pool to add a node taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool update`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


## Use node initialization taints (preview)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Prerequisites and limitations

- You need the Azure CLI version
`3.0.0b3`

or later installed and configured. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can only apply initialization taints via cluster create or upgrade when using the AKS API. If using ARM template that will result in a Managed Cluster level operation, you can specify node initialization taints during node pool creation and update. Agentpool level operations are blocked when
`NodeInitializationTaints`

are present in the request body. - You can't apply initialization taints to Windows node pools using the Azure CLI.

### Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a cluster with a node initialization taint

Create a cluster with a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks create`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

The node initialization taints you specify apply to all of the node pools in the cluster. To apply the initialization taint to a specific node, you can use an ARM template instead of the CLI.

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint

Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

When updating a cluster with a node initialization taint, the taints apply to all node pools in the cluster. If your nodes are using VMSS, you can view updates to node initialization taints on the node after the node's VMSS model is updated (for example, after a node image version upgrade operation). Initialization taints will not appear on your nodes until an operation that triggers a VMSS model update occurs.

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`


## Check the status of the node pool

After applying the node taint or initialization taint, check the status of the node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`

If you applied node initialization taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeInitializationTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeInitializationTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`


## Check that the taint is set on the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool has the specified`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: sku=gpu:NoSchedule ... ], ... ... ]`


Important

If your nodes are using VMSS, node initialization taints will not be visible on actual nodes in your cluster until an operation that triggers VMSS model update occurs (for example, Kubernetes version upgrade or node image version upgrade).

## Remove node taints

### Remove a specific node taint

Remove node taints using the

command. The following example command removes the`az aks nodepool update`

`"sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`

node taint from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


### Remove all node taints

Remove all node taints from a node pool using the

command. The following example command removes all node taints from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


## Remove node initialization taints

You have the following options to remove node initialization taints from the node:

**Remove node initialization taints temporarily**using the Kubernetes API. If you remove them this way, the taints reappear after node scaling or upgrade occurs. New nodes still have the node initialization taint after scaling. Node initialization taints appear on all nodes after upgrading.**Remove node initialization taints permanently**by untainting the node using the Kubernetes API, and then removing the taint using the AKS API. Once the initialization taints are removed from cluster spec using AKS API, newly created nodes after reimage operations no longer have initialization taints.

When you remove all initialization taint occurrences from node pool replicas, the existing initialization taint might reappear after an upgrade with any new initialization taints.

### Remove node initialization taints temporarily

Remove node initialization taints temporarily using the

`kubectl taint nodes`

command.This command removes the taint from only the specified node. If you want to remove the taint from every node in the node pool, you need to run the command for every node that you want the taint removed from.

`kubectl taint nodes $NODE_POOL_NAME sku=gpu:NoSchedule-`

Once removed, node initialization taints reappear after node scaling or upgrading occurs.


### Remove node initialization taints permanently

Follow steps in

[Remove node initialization taints temporarily](#remove-node-initialization-taints-temporarily)to remove the node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API.Remove the taint from the node using the AKS API using the

command. This command removes the node initialization taint from every node in the cluster.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints ""`


## Check that the taint has been removed from the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you removed a node taint, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool doesn't have the removed taint under`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: ... ], ... ... ]`

# Enable Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 is a US government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information technology products and systems. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to create Linux and Windows node pools with FIPS 140-2 enabled. Deployments running on FIPS-enabled node pools can use those cryptographic modules to provide increased security and help meet security controls as part of FedRAMP compliance. For more information on FIPS 140-2, see [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140](/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fips-140-2).

Caution

In this article, there are references to a feature that may be using Ubuntu OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS.

- Starting on March 17, 2027, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools.
[Upgrade your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to kubernetes version 1.35+ to migrate to a supported Ubuntu version. For more information on this retirement, see[AKS GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues)

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.32.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run `az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Note

AKS Monitoring Addon supports FIPS enabled node pools with Ubuntu, Azure Linux, and Windows starting with Agent version 3.1.17 (Linux) and Win-3.1.17 (Windows).

## Limitations

- FIPS-enabled node pools have the following limitations:
- FIPS-enabled node pools require Kubernetes version 1.19 and greater.
- To update the underlying packages or modules used for FIPS, you must use
[Node Image Upgrade](node-image-upgrade). - Container images on the FIPS nodes aren't assessed for FIPS compliance.
- Mounting of a CIFS share fails because FIPS disables some authentication modules. To work around this issue, see
[Errors when mounting a file share on a FIPS-enabled node pool](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share#fipsnodepool). - FIPS-enabled node pools with
[Arm64 VMs](use-arm64-vms)are only supported with Azure Linux 3.0+. - FIPS isn't supported with
[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).


Important

The FIPS-enabled Linux image is a different image than the default Linux image used for Linux-based node pools.

FIPS-enabled node images can have different version numbers, such as kernel version, than images that aren't FIPS-enabled. The update cycle for FIPS-enabled node pools and node images can differ from node pools and images that aren't FIPS-enabled.

## Supported OS Versions

You can create FIPS-enabled node pools on all supported OS types (Linux and Windows). However, not all OS versions support FIPS-enabled node pools. After a new OS version is released, there's typically a waiting period before it's FIPS compliant.

This table includes the supported OS versions:

| OS Type | OS SKU | FIPS Compliance |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | Supported |
| Linux | Azure Linux | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2019 | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2022 | Supported |

When requesting FIPS enabled Ubuntu, if the default Ubuntu version doesn't support FIPS, AKS defaults to the most recent FIPS-supported version of Ubuntu. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Linux node pools. Since 22.04 doesn't currently support FIPS, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 20.04 for Linux FIPS-enabled node pools.

Note

Previously, you could use the GetOSOptions API to determine whether a given OS supported FIPS. The GetOSOptions API is now deprecated and it will no longer be included in new AKS API versions starting with 2024-05-01.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image`

Note

You can also use the

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter with the[az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)command when creating a cluster to enable FIPS on the default node pool. When adding node pools to a cluster created in this way, you still must use the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter when adding node pools to create a FIPS-enabled node pool.Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows the

*fipsnp*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ fipsnp True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-fipsnp`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter. Unlike Linux-based node pools, Windows node pools share the same image set.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image \ --os-type Windows`

Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

Verify Windows node pools have access to the FIPS cryptographic libraries by

[creating an RDP connection to a Windows node](rdp)in a FIPS-enabled node pool and check the registry. From the**Run**application, enter`regedit`

.Look for

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy`

in the registry.If

`Enabled`

is set to*1*, then FIPS is enabled.FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Update an existing node pool to enable or disable FIPS

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable or disable FIPS. If you're planning to migrate your node pools from non-FIPS to FIPS, first validate that your application is working properly in a test environment before migrating it to a production environment. Validating your application in a test environment should prevent issues caused by the FIPS kernel blocking some weak cipher or encryption algorithm, such as an MD4 algorithm that isn't FIPS compliant.

Note

When updating an existing Linux node pool to enable or disable FIPS, the node pool update moves between the fips and non-fips image. This node pool update triggers a reimage to complete the update. This can cause the node pool update to take a few minutes to complete.

### Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.64.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Enable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable FIPS. When you update an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current image to the recommended FIPS image of the same OS SKU.

Update a node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-np`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-np-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Disable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to disable FIPS. When updating an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current FIPS image to the recommended non-FIPS image of the same OS SKU. The node image change will occur after a reimage.

Update a Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--disable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --disable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool isn't FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool isn't FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np False nodepool1 False`


## Message of the Day

Pass the `--message-of-the-day`

flag with the location of the file to replace the Message of the Day on Linux nodes at cluster creation or node pool creation.

Create a cluster with message of the day using the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command.

```
az aks create --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --message-of-the-day ./newMOTD.txt
```


Add a node pool with message of the day using the [az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command.

```
az aks nodepool add --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --message-of-the-day ./newMOTD.txt
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article outlines the support policy for the Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Versioning and support policy

### Service mesh add-on release calendar

The Istio-based service mesh add-on release calendar indicates each revision's AKS compatibility and estimated release and deprecation dates.

New minor revisions and patches are rolled out as part of AKS releases. Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To see real-time updates of regional release status and AKS release notes containing updates about Istio revision support, visit the [AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

| Service mesh revision | Upstream release | AKS release | End of life | Compatible AKS versions | Compatible AKS LTS versions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| asm-1-17 | Feb 2023 | Apr 2023 | Jan 2024 | 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 | |

If using an AKS [long term-support (LTS) cluster](long-term-support), a newer revision may be declared as compatible when a previous compatible Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version's end of life. For more details, read Istio's [AKS compatibility policy](#aks-compatibility).

### Supported revisions

**Minor revision**:- At any given time, at least two revisions of the Istio-based service mesh add-on are supported.
- An older revision
`n-2`

will continue to be supported until six weeks after the newest revision`n`

starts rolling out to all regions. For example, if`asm-1-22`

just started rolling out to all regions,`asm-1-20`

will be deprecated after six weeks. - Deprecation means no new mesh installations can be done with this revision. While clusters already having this revision continue to work, for support issues and security patches, it's recommended to
[upgrade to a newer supported mesh revision](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade).

**Patch version**:- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then
[upgrade istio-proxy sidecars by restarting their workloads](istio-upgrade#patch-version-upgrade). - AKS reserves the right to deprecate patches if a critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) or security vulnerability is detected. For awareness on patch availability and any ad-hoc deprecation, refer to
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases)and visit the[AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then

### Default revision

If a revision isn't explicitly provided by user during installation, the `n-1`

revision is installed by default. For example, if `asm-1-22`

is the latest revision, the default is `asm-1-21`

.

### AKS compatibility

Each revision of the add-on is compatible with a set of AKS minor versions established by the [upstream Istio support and release calendar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases).

**AKS LTS clusters may be compatible with additional revisions beyond upstream Istio's support table.** For Istio revisions `asm-1-25`

+ and AKS LTS versions 1.28+, every supported AKS LTS version will have *at least one* compatible Istio revision.

To check the compatible AKS versions for an Istio revision, use the command [ az aks mesh get-revisions](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions):

```
az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table
```


This command has been updated to include separate `CompatibleWith`

outputs for `KubernetesOfficial`

(standard tier) and `AKSLongTermSupport`

, replacing the earlier response that only included `kubernetes`

(standard tier).

If using the Azure portal to enable the Istio add-on for an existing cluster, the available Istio revisions will be filtered based on the cluster's tier.

Each Istio add-on revision follows upstream lifecycle for end of life and patch availability. This means:

Every Istio revision will not be compatible with every AKS LTS version, but every AKS LTS version will be compatible with at least one Istio add-on revision.

If an Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version it is compatible with, a newer revision will be declared compatible with that LTS version. The add-on will need to be upgraded to stay in support.

For example, if

`asm-1-26`

is compatible with AKS LTS 1.28, and`asm-1-26`

reaches end of life,`asm-1-27`

may become compatible with 1.28 LTS instead.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked customizations

The Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS designates features and [configuration options](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values) as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

.

**Blocked**: Disallowed features and configuration options are blocked via add-on managed admission webhooks. The API server immediately publishes the error message to the user that the feature is disallowed.**Supported**: Supported features receive support from Azure support.**Allowed**: Allowed features are open and available to Istio add-on users but aren't covered by Azure support.

# Best practices for application developers to manage resources in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few key areas to consider. The way you manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services you provide.

This article focuses on running your clusters and workloads from an application developer perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

This article covers the following topics:

- Pod resource requests and limits.
- Ways to develop, debug, and deploy applications with Bridge to Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code.

## Define pod resource requests and limits


Best practice guidanceSet pod requests and limits on all pods in your YAML manifests. If the AKS cluster uses

resource quotasand you don't define these values, your deployment may be rejected.

Use pod requests and limits to manage compute resources within an AKS cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler of the compute resources to assign to a pod.

### Pod CPU/Memory requests

*Pod requests* define a set amount of CPU and memory the pod needs regularly.

In your pod specifications, it's important you define these requests and limits based on the above information. If you don't include these values, the Kubernetes scheduler can't consider the resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

Monitor the performance of your application to adjust pod requests. If you underestimate pod requests, your application may receive degraded performance due to over-scheduling a node. If requests are overestimated, your application may have increased scheduling difficulty.

### Pod CPU/Memory limits

*Pod limits* set the maximum amount of CPU and memory a pod can use. *Memory limits* define which pods should be removed when nodes are unstable due to insufficient resources. Without proper limits set, pods are removed until resource pressure is lifted. While a pod may exceed the *CPU limit* periodically, the pod isn't removed for exceeding the CPU limit.

Pod limits define when a pod loses control of resource consumption. When it exceeds the limit, the pod is marked for removal. This behavior maintains node health and minimizes impact to pods sharing the node. If you don't set a pod limit, it defaults to the highest available value on a given node.

Avoid setting a pod limit higher than your nodes can support. Each AKS node reserves a set amount of CPU and memory for the core Kubernetes components. Your application may try to consume too many resources on the node for other pods to successfully run.

Monitor the performance of your application at different times during the day or week. Determine peak demand times and align the pod limits to the resources required to meet maximum needs.

Important

In your pod specifications, define these requests and limits based on the above information. Failing to include these values prevents the Kubernetes scheduler from accounting for resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

If the scheduler places a pod on a node with insufficient resources, application performance is degraded. Cluster administrators **must set resource quotas** on a namespace that requires you to set resource requests and limits. For more information, see

[resource quotas on AKS clusters](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas).

When you define a CPU request or limit, the value is measured in CPU units.

*1.0*CPU equates to one underlying virtual CPU core on the node.- The same measurement is used for GPUs.

- You can define fractions measured in millicores. For example,
*100 m*is*0.1*of an underlying vCPU core.

In the following basic example for a single NGINX pod, the pod requests *100 m* of CPU time and *128Mi* of memory. The resource limits for the pod are set to *250 m* CPU and *256Mi* memory.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
- name: mypod
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
resources:
requests:
cpu: 100m
memory: 128Mi
limits:
cpu: 250m
memory: 256Mi
```


For more information about resource measurements and assignments, see [Managing compute resources for containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/).

## Develop and debug applications against an AKS cluster


Best practice guidanceDevelopment teams should deploy and debug against an AKS cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes.


With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can develop, debug, and test applications directly against an AKS cluster. Developers within a team collaborate to build and test throughout the application lifecycle. You can continue to use existing tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Using integrated development and test process with Bridge to Kubernetes reduces the need for local test environments like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). Instead, you develop and test against an AKS cluster, even in secured and isolated clusters.

Note

Bridge to Kubernetes is intended for use with applications running on Linux pods and nodes.

## Use the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for Kubernetes


Best practice guidanceInstall and use the VS Code extension for Kubernetes when you write YAML manifests. You can also use the extension for integrated deployment solution, which may help application owners that infrequently interact with the AKS cluster.


The [Visual Studio Code extension for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) helps you develop and deploy applications to AKS. The extension provides the following features:

Intellisense for Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and templates.

The ability to browse, deploy, and edit capabilities for Kubernetes resources from within VS Code.

Intellisense checks for resource requests or limits being set in the pod specifications:


## Next steps

This article focused on how to run your cluster and workloads from a cluster operator perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Onboard custom models for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As an AI engineer or developer, you might have to prototype and deploy AI workloads with a range of different model weights. AKS provides the option to deploy inferencing workloads using open-source presets supported out-of-box and managed in the KAITO [model registry](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets) or to dynamically download from the [HuggingFace registry](https://huggingface.co/models) at runtime onto your AKS cluster.

In this article, you learn how to onboard a sample HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on without having to manage custom images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an account, you can

[create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).An AKS cluster with the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled. For more information, see

[Enable KAITO on an AKS cluster](ai-toolchain-operator#enable-the-ai-toolchain-operator-add-on-on-an-aks-cluster).This example deployment requires quota for the

`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

virtual machine (VM) family in your Azure subscription. If you don't have quota for this VM family, please[request a quota increase](/en-us/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal).Note

Currently, only the HuggingFace runtime supports inference with the KAITO custom model deployment template.


## Choose an open-source language model from HuggingFace

In this example, we use the [BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7) small language model. Alternatively, you can choose from thousands of text-generation models supported on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>`

Clone the KAITO project GitHub repository using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito.git`


## Deploy your model inferencing workload using the KAITO workspace template

Navigate to the

`kaito`

directory and copy the[sample deployment YAML](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/examples/custom-model-integration/custom-model-deployment.yaml)manifest. Replace the default values in the following fields with your model's requirements. For this example, we specify the**bloom-1b7**HuggingFace model ID for[BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7)model:`instanceType`

: The minimum VM size for this inference service deployment is`Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4`

. For larger model sizes you can choose a VM in thefamily with higher memory capacity.`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

`MODEL_ID`

: Replace with your model's specific HuggingFace identifier, which can be found after`https://huggingface.co/`

in the model card URL.`"--torch_dtype"`

: Set to`"float16"`

for compatibility with V100 GPUs. For A100, H100 or newer GPUs, use`"bfloat16"`

.- (Optional)
`HF_TOKEN`

: Specify the values in this section only if you are deploying a private or gated Hugging Face model for inference.

Save these changes to your

`custom-model-deployment.yaml`

file.Run the deployment in your AKS cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f custom-model-deployment.yaml`


## Test your custom model inferencing service

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace using the

`kubectl get workspace`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace-custom-llm -w`

Note

Note that machine readiness can take

*up to 10 minutes*, and workspace readiness*up to 20 minutes*.Check your language model inference service and get the service IP address using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-custom-llm -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')`

Test your custom model inference service with a sample input of your choice using the

[OpenAI API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat):`kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never curl --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -X POST http://$SERVICE_IP/v1/completions \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "bloom-1b7", "prompt": "What sport should I play in rainy weather?", "max_tokens": 20 }'`


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring extra Azure compute charges.

Delete the KAITO inference workspace using the `kubectl delete workspace`

command.

```
kubectl delete workspace workspace-custom-llm
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to schedule and deploy sample batch jobs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kueue. Also, this guide covers installing Kueue, configuring ResourceFlavors and ClusterQueues for fine-grained resource management, and submitting jobs via LocalQueues. You also learn how to use Kueue to queue up a sample batch job and track the results across Pending, Running, and Finished states.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

To learn more about Kueue and common uses cases for batch workload administrators and users, see [Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview).

## Prerequisites

- An existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Azure CLI installed on your local machine. To install or upgrade, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Helm version 3 or above](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.[The latest version of Kueue installed in a dedicated namespace on your cluster](kueue-overview#prerequisites).

## Define a ResourceFlavor object

In Kueue, a ResourceFlavors enables fine-grained resource management by associating workloads with specific nodes, taints, tolerations, or availability zones. For nodes, `ResourceFlavors`

can define the characteristics like pricing, availability, brands, models, and architecture (that is, x86 versus ARM CPUs). A `ClusterQueue`

uses these flavors to manage quotas and admission policies for workloads.

This configuration defines a `ResourceFlavor`

without any labels or taints, known as an empty `ResourceFlavor`

. This configuration is perfect when quotas for different flavors don't need to be managed.

Create and save a

`ResourceFlavor`

in a file named`resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat << EOF > resourceflavor-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ResourceFlavor metadata: name: on-demand EOF`

apply

`kubectl apply -f resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

verify

`kubectl get resourceflavors`

Example output

`NAME AGE on-demand 5m32s`


## Create a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that governs a pool of resources, defining usage limits and Fair Sharing rules. Where applicable, Fair Sharing rules allow another ClusterQueue in the **same** cohort to unused quota for pending jobs. Each ClusterQueue specifies which flavors it supports and how much quota is available for each.

This sample `ClusterQueue`

defines:

: Indicates that`namespaceSelector: {}`

`sample-jobs`

accepts workloads from any namespace that references this`ClusterQueue`

via a`LocalQueue`

(you can restrict usage (for example, to only team A's namespace) with a label selector).: Defines the standard CPU and memory resource types managed by this`coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"]`

in`resourceGroups`

`ClusterQueue`

.: Only workloads scheduled on`flavor`

of`on-demand`

nodes with`4`

CPUs,`8Gi`

memory`on-demand`

nodes consume this quota. If the cluster uses up this quota, it doesn't admit any other workloads using this flavor (unless you allow borrowing from the`cohort`

).

Create and save a Kueue

`ClusterQueue`

in a file named`clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat <<EOF > clusterqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterQueue metadata: name: sample-jobs spec: cohort: general namespaceSelector: {} # Accept workloads from any namespace resourceGroups: - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"] flavors: - name: on-demand resources: - name: "cpu" nominalQuota: 4 - name: "memory" nominalQuota: 8Gi EOF`

Apply the

`ClusterQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the ClusterQueue` manifest was applied

`kubectl get clusterqueues`

Example output

`NAME COHORT PENDING WORKLOADS sample-jobs general 0`


Note

The `ClusterQueue`

isn't ready for use until a `ResourceFlavor`

object is configured. If you create a `ClusterQueue`

without any existing `ResourceFlavor`

, workloads referencing it are marked as `Inadmissible`

.

## Create a LocalQueue

A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs. A `LocalQueue`

is assigned to one `ClusterQueue`

from which resources are allocated to run its workloads.

This sample `LocalQueue`

configures the following settings:

- Enables users in the
`batch-jobs`

namespace to submit batch workloads to Kueue. - Route the batch workloads to the
`sample-jobs`

`ClusterQueue`

, which manages the actual compute resource quotas and scheduling policies.

Create a namespace named

*batch-jobs*using the`kubectl create`

command.`kubectl create ns batch-jobs`

Create and save a

`LocalQueue`

in a file named`localqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following YAML manifest:`cat <<EOF > localqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: LocalQueue metadata: name: sample-queue namespace: batch-jobs spec: clusterQueue: sample-jobs EOF`

Apply the

`LocalQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f localqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the

`LocalQueue`

manifest was applied`kubectl get localqueues --all-namespaces`

Exampmle output

`NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTERQUEUE PENDING WORKLOADS ADMITTED WORKLOADS batch-jobs sample-queue sample-jobs 0 0`


## Create 2 batch jobs

This configuration defines two Kubernetes batch jobs submitted to the batch-jobs namespace and assigned to the sample-queue managed by Kueue. Both jobs are single-instance (parallelism: 1, completions: 1) and are configured with `Never`

restart policy. The fields `parallelism`

and `completions`

control how many pods are run and how the job is considered complete. So `parallelism`

and `completions`

of 1 means that one pod can run at once, and the job is marked as complete once one pod finishes successfully, per batch job.

- Job test-batch-1: Requests one CPU and 500Mi memory
- Job test-batch-2: Requests two CPUs and 1Gi memory

Create two sample batch jobs to deploy in the

*batch-jobs*namespace using the following YAML manifest named`batch-workloads.yaml`

:`cat <<EOF > batch-workloads.yaml apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-1 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Running test-batch-1; sleep 60"] resources: requests: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" limits: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" restartPolicy: Never --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-2 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Waiting in queue for CPUs...; sleep 30"] resources: requests: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" limits: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" restartPolicy: Never EOF`

Apply the manifest for the batch jobs using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f batch-workloads.yaml`


## Verify Batch Jobs are Submitted to `LocalQueue`


View the status of the batched workloads using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get workloads --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME ADMITTED AGE test-batch-1 True 10s test-batch-2 False 5s`

Run the following command for

`test-batch-2`

while it is in a`Pending`

state`kubectl get workloads test-batch-2 -o yaml`

Expected output

`... ... Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: False Reason: QuotaUnavailable Message: Insufficient quota in ClusterQueue sample-jobs (flavor on-demand): requested 2 CPUs, available 1 ... ...`

After

`test-batch-1`

completes,`test-batch-2`

will be admitted and run.Now, the output should look like the following example output:

`Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: True Last Transition Time: 1234-56-78T00:00:00Z Admission: ClusterQueue: sample-jobs PodSetAssignments: Name: main Flavors: cpu: on-demand memory: on-demand ResourceUsage: cpu: 2 memory: 1Gi`

View the final status of the

`batch-jobs`

namespace using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get job,deploy,rs,pod,workload --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/test-batch-1 Complete 1/1 97s 3m15s job.batch/test-batch-2 Complete 1/1 35s 3m15s NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/test-batch-1-hb8zl 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s pod/test-batch-2-dx9hk 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-1-6fb85 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-2-84f49 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s`


## FAQ

### Question 1: How can I confirm that the Kueue controller is available and running as expected?

Confirm the Kueue controller manager pod is running using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get pods --namespace kueue-system`

The Kueue controller manager pod should be in a

`Running`

state with`1/1`

containers ready, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kueue-controller-manager-xxxxxxx 1/1 Running 0 2m`

If the

`Status`

shows`CrashLoopBackOff`

or`Pending`

, check the deployment logs using the`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs --namespace kueue-system deployment/kueue-controller-manager`


### Question 2: One or more of the Kueue custom resources (CRDs) are missing when I install via Helm. How can I ensure all of the CRDs are installed?

After installing Kueue with the

[Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview)guidance, confirm that all of the CRDs are installed using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get crds | grep kueue`

These CRDs should be listed, as shown in the following example output:

`admissionchecks.kueue.x-k8s.io clusterqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io cohorts.kueue.x-k8s.io localqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueclusters.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io provisioningrequestconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io resourceflavors.kueue.x-k8s.io topologies.kueue.x-k8s.io workloadpriorityclasses.kueue.x-k8s.io workloads.kueue.x-k8s.io`

If one or more of the CRDs are missing, you might see errors in controller logs, failed job queuing,

`CrashLoopBackOff`

for the controller, or inability to admit or schedule workloads. In this case, you can manually reinstall the Kueue CRDs using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/latest/download/kueue-crds.yaml`

Note

Note that if you manually install the CRDs, you need to manually delete them once you're finished using the

`kubectl delete`

command.

### Question 3: What's the difference between a LocalQueue and a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that defines and governs a pool of compute resources like CPU, memory, pods, and accelerators across the entire Kubernetes cluster. A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs within the defined Kubernetes cluster. This separation allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation and multi-tenant scheduling without exposing cluster-wide quotas directly to users.

How they work together:

- A user submits a job to a LocalQueue in their namespace.
- Kueue routes the job to the referenced ClusterQueue.
- The ClusterQueue checks resource availability and quota limits.
- If admitted, the job is unsuspended and scheduled.

## Next steps

In this article, you:

- Installed Kueue on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Helm and verified CRDs, controller health, and namespace setup.
- Configured
`ClusterQueue`

and`LocalQueue`

for general-purpose workloads with resource quotas and flavors (such as on-demand). - Submitted two batch jobs to demonstrate queuing: one admitted immediately, the second held due to quota limits, then admitted when resources became available.
- Monitored workload status and controller logs to confirm scheduling behavior and queuing logic.

# Migrate Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) pods from pod-managed identity to Microsoft Entra Workload ID

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Migrate AKS pods from pod-managed identities to [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview) (workload identity) using one of three approaches based on your current [Azure Identity SDK](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-v2-libraries) version: latest SDK parallel deployment, migration sidecar proxy (Linux only), or SDK rewrite.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. Run the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Set environment variables

The following table lists the environment variables used in the commands throughout this article. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.

| Environment variable | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`SUBSCRIPTION_ID` |
The ID of the Azure subscription where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |
`RESOURCE_GROUP` |
The name of the resource group where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `myResourceGroup` |
`LOCATION` |
The Azure region where the AKS cluster and managed identity are created. | `eastus` |
`CLUSTER_NAME` |
The name of the AKS cluster. | `myAKSCluster` |
`MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the user-assigned managed identity. | `myManagedIdentity` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` |
The name of the Kubernetes service account to create or associate with the managed identity. | `workload-identity-sa` |
`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE` |
The namespace of the Kubernetes service account. | `default` |
`FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME` |
The name of the federated identity credential to create. | `myFederatedIdentity` |

## Choose a migration path

Select the appropriate migration approach based on your current Azure Identity SDK version:

**Latest Azure Identity SDK**: If your application already uses the latest version of Azure Identity SDK, you can migrate by deploying Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.**Older SDK with migration sidecar**- If your application uses an older SDK version and runs on Linux containers, you can use a temporary migration sidecar to proxy Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions while planning your SDK upgrade.**Older SDK rewrite approach**: If your application uses an older SDK version, you can update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to workload identity.

## Prepare for migration

For all migration paths, you need to have the federated trust set up before you update your application to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following are the minimum steps required:

[Create a managed identity](#create-a-managed-identity)credential.- Associate the user-assigned managed identity with the Kubernetes service account already used for the pod-managed identity or
[create a new Kubernetes service account](#create-kubernetes-service-account)and then associate it with the managed identity. [Establish a federated trust relationship](#establish-federated-identity-credential-trust)between the managed identity and Microsoft Entra ID using the[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)issuer URL and the service account.

## Migrate from latest version of Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application already uses the latest version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to migrate with minimal code changes.

**Migration approach**: Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with pod-managed identity, verify functionality, then remove pod-managed identity.

**Steps**:

- Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify the application can authenticate successfully using workload identity.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations from your application.- Remove the pod-managed identity add-on from your cluster.

## Use a migration sidecar (Linux containers only)

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK, runs on Linux containers, and you need a temporary solution while planning SDK updates.

**Migration approach**: Deploy a migration sidecar that proxies IMDS transactions to OIDC, allowing your existing application code to work without immediate changes.

**Important limitations**:

**Linux containers only**. Windows containers aren't supported.**Temporary solution**that's not intended for long-term production use.**Planning required**to schedule SDK updates for long-term support.

**Steps**:

[Deploy the workload with migration sidecar](#deploy-the-workload-with-migration-sidecar)to proxy IMDS transactions.- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
- Schedule application SDK updates to supported Azure Identity versions.
- Once SDKs are updated, remove the proxy sidecar and redeploy applications.

## Rewrite application for latest Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to update to the latest supported SDK before migrating.

**Migration approach**: Update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID with the updated code.

**Technical outcomes**:

- Uses current Azure Identity SDK versions (no deprecation timeline).
- Supports both Linux and Windows containers (unlike sidecar approach).
- Eliminates proxy components and IMDS translation overhead.

**Steps**:

- Update your application code to use the latest
[Azure Identity SDK](workload-identity-overview#prerequisites). - Test the updated application with pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin authenticating using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations and add-on.

## Set an active Azure subscription

Set a specific Azure subscription as the current active subscription using the

command.`az account set`

`az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Create a managed identity

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Get managed identity client ID

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'clientId' -otsv)"`


## Grant managed identity access to Azure resources

- Grant the managed identity the permissions needed to access the required Azure resources. Follow the steps in
[Assign a managed identity access to a resource](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)to assign the appropriate role to the managed identity.

## Get OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az aks show`

`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)"`

The variable should contain an issuer URL similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/`

By default, the issuer uses the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location the AKS cluster is deployed in. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key.

## Get AKS cluster credentials

Get the AKS cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`


## Create Kubernetes service account

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the managed identity client ID using the

`kubectl apply`

command. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`

The following output resembles successful creation of the identity:

`Serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Establish federated identity credential trust

Create the federated identity credential between the managed identity, service account issuer, and subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create --name $FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME --identity-name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

The federated identity credential takes a few minutes to propagate after being added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the token request might fail because the Azure AD directory cache contains outdated information.


## Deploy the workload with migration sidecar

If your application uses user-assigned managed identity and still relies on IMDS to get an access token you can use the migration sidecar to start migrating to Microsoft Entra Workload ID. In long-term applications, you should modify the code to use the latest Azure Identity SDKs that support client assertion.

To update or deploy the workload, add the following [pod annotations](workload-identity-overview#pod-annotations) to your pod specification (only if you want to use the migration sidecar):

| Pod annotation | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar` |
Indicates whether to inject the proxy sidecar into the pod. | `true` or `false` |
`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port` |
Desired port for the proxy sidecar. | Default value: `8000` |

When you create a pod with these annotations, the Microsoft Entra Workload ID mutating webhook automatically injects the `init-container`

and proxy sidecar to the pod spec. The following YAML shows an example of what the mutating webhook adds to the pod deployment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: httpbin-pod
labels:
app: httpbin
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
annotations:
azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar: "true"
spec:
serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
initContainers:
- name: init-networking
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy-init:v1.1.0
securityContext:
capabilities:
add:
- NET_ADMIN
drop:
- ALL
privileged: true
runAsUser: 0
env:
- name: PROXY_PORT
value: "8000"
containers:
- name: nginx
image: nginx:alpine
ports:
- containerPort: 80
- name: proxy
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy:v1.1.0
ports:
- containerPort: 8000
```


## Verify the workload with migration sidecar

Verify the pod is in a running state using the

command. Replace`kubectl describe pod`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl describe pods <pod-name>`

Verify the pod is passing IMDS transactions using the

command. Replace`kubectl logs`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl logs <pod-name>`

The following example log output resembles successful communication through the proxy sidecar. Verify the logs show a token is successfully acquired and the

`GET`

operation is successful.`I0926 00:29:29.968723 1 proxy.go:97] proxy "msg"="starting the proxy server" "port"=8080 "userAgent"="azure-workload-identity/proxy/v0.13.0-12-gc8527f3 (linux/amd64) c8527f3/2022-09-26-00:19" I0926 00:29:29.972496 1 proxy.go:173] proxy "msg"="received readyz request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/readyz" I0926 00:29:30.936769 1 proxy.go:107] proxy "msg"="received token request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>" I0926 00:29:31.101998 1 proxy.go:129] proxy "msg"="successfully acquired token" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>"`


## Remove pod-managed identity

After you complete your testing and the application can successfully get a token using the proxy sidecar, you can remove the identity and pod-managed identity mapping from your AKS cluster

Remove the pod-managed identity binding from your pod using the

command. Replace`az aks pod-identity delete`

`<pod-identity-name>`

and`<pod-identity-namespace>`

with the name and namespace of your pod identity.`az aks pod-identity delete --name <pod-identity-name> --namespace <pod-identity-namespace> --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

# Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to resize an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It's important to right-size your clusters to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

## Cluster right-sizing

When you create an AKS cluster, you specify the number of nodes and the size of the nodes, which determines the compute capacity of the cluster. Oversized clusters can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersized clusters can lead to performance issues. You can adjust the number and size of the nodes in the cluster to right-size the cluster to meet the needs of your applications.

Consider the following factors when right-sizing your cluster:

**Resource requirements**: Understand the resource requirements of your applications to determine the number of nodes and the size of the nodes needed to run your workloads.**Performance requirements**: Determine the performance requirements of your applications to ensure that the cluster can meet the demands of your workloads.**Cost considerations**: Optimize costs by right-sizing your cluster to avoid unnecessary costs associated with oversized clusters.**Application demands**: Monitor the demands of your applications to adjust the size of the cluster in response to changing demands.**Infrastructure constraints**: Consider the infrastructure constraints of your environment, such as capacity or reserved instance limiting to specific SKUs, to ensure that the cluster can be right-sized within the limits of your environment.

## Monitor cluster performance and cost

Closely monitor the performance and cost of your clusters to ensure they're right-sized to meet the needs of your application and make adjustments as needed. You can use the following resources for monitoring:

[Identify high CPU usage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-high-cpu-consuming-containers-aks)[Troubleshoot memory saturation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-memory-saturation-aks)[Cost analysis add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cost-analysis)[Configure the Metrics Server Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)

## When to resize a cluster

You might want to resize a cluster in scenarios such as the following:

- If you see that CPU and memory usage is consistently low, consider
*downsizing*the cluster. If usage is consistently high, make sure you have[autoscaling enabled](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster)and increase the maximum node count if necessary. - The
[cost analysis add-on for AKS](cost-analysis)shows you details about node usage and cost that indicate you might benefit from cluster resizing. For example, if you see that your nodes have a*high idle cost*with a*low usage cost*, you might consider resizing your cluster to reduce costs. - The
[Metrics Server VPA](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)shows you that your requests and/or limits are too high or low based on historical usage. You can use this information to adjust your cluster size to better match your workload. - You experience performance issues such as resource starvation. This might be a result of the cluster being undersized for the demands of your applications.

## What happens when I resize a cluster?

### Increasing cluster size

You can increase the size of an AKS cluster by adding nodes to the cluster. You can [add nodes to the cluster manually](scale-cluster) or [configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster) in response to changing demands.

When you increase the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- New node instances are created using the same configuration as the existing nodes in the cluster.
- New pods might be scheduled on the new nodes to distribute the workload across the cluster.
- Existing pods don't move to the new nodes unless they are rescheduled due to node failures or other reasons.

### Decreasing cluster size

You can decrease the size of an AKS cluster by removing nodes from the cluster. When you remove nodes from the cluster, the nodes are automatically drained and removed from the cluster. You can remove nodes from the cluster manually or configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

When you decrease the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- AKS gracefully terminates the nodes and drains the pods running on the nodes before removing the nodes from the cluster.
- Any pods managed by a replication controller are rescheduled on other node instances in the cluster.
- Any pods that aren't managed by a replication controller aren't restarted.

## Manually resize an AKS cluster

- Resize an AKS cluster using the
command with the`az aks scale`

`--node-count`

and`--nodepool-name`

parameters.

Before running the resize command, set the required environment variables with your own values. The example values should be substituted with your actual resource group, cluster, desired node count, and node pool name.

```
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count $NUM_NODES --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL_NAME
```


Results:

```
{
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 4,
"maxCount": null,
"minCount": null,
"name": "nodepool1",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "xxxxx",
"fqdn": "xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
...
}
```


Repeat this command for each node pool in the cluster that you want to resize. If your cluster has only one node pool, you can omit the `--nodepool-name`

parameter.

## Automatically resize an AKS cluster

Use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) to automatically resize your node pools in response to changing demands.

For more information, see the [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview). To configure cluster autoscaling in AKS, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

If using an AKS [long term-support (LTS) cluster](long-term-support), a newer revision may be declared as compatible when a previous compatible Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version's end of life. For more details, read Istio's [AKS compatibility policy](#aks-compatibility).

### Supported revisions

**Minor revision**:- At any given time, at least two revisions of the Istio-based service mesh add-on are supported.
- An older revision
`n-2`

will continue to be supported until six weeks after the newest revision`n`

starts rolling out to all regions. For example, if`asm-1-22`

just started rolling out to all regions,`asm-1-20`

will be deprecated after six weeks. - Deprecation means no new mesh installations can be done with this revision. While clusters already having this revision continue to work, for support issues and security patches, it's recommended to
[upgrade to a newer supported mesh revision](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade).

**Patch version**:- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then
[upgrade istio-proxy sidecars by restarting their workloads](istio-upgrade#patch-version-upgrade). - AKS reserves the right to deprecate patches if a critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) or security vulnerability is detected. For awareness on patch availability and any ad-hoc deprecation, refer to
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases)and visit the[AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then

### Default revision

If a revision isn't explicitly provided by user during installation, the `n-1`

revision is installed by default. For example, if `asm-1-22`

is the latest revision, the default is `asm-1-21`

.

### AKS compatibility

Each revision of the add-on is compatible with a set of AKS minor versions established by the [upstream Istio support and release calendar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases).

**AKS LTS clusters may be compatible with additional revisions beyond upstream Istio's support table.** For Istio revisions `asm-1-25`

+ and AKS LTS versions 1.28+, every supported AKS LTS version will have *at least one* compatible Istio revision.

To check the compatible AKS versions for an Istio revision, use the command [ az aks mesh get-revisions](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions):

```
az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table
```


This command has been updated to include separate `CompatibleWith`

outputs for `KubernetesOfficial`

(standard tier) and `AKSLongTermSupport`

, replacing the earlier response that only included `kubernetes`

(standard tier).

If using the Azure portal to enable the Istio add-on for an existing cluster, the available Istio revisions will be filtered based on the cluster's tier.

Each Istio add-on revision follows upstream lifecycle for end of life and patch availability. This means:

Every Istio revision will not be compatible with every AKS LTS version, but every AKS LTS version will be compatible with at least one Istio add-on revision.

If an Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version it is compatible with, a newer revision will be declared compatible with that LTS version. The add-on will need to be upgraded to stay in support.

For example, if

`asm-1-26`

is compatible with AKS LTS 1.28, and`asm-1-26`

reaches end of life,`asm-1-27`

may become compatible with 1.28 LTS instead.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked customizations

The Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS designates features and [configuration options](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values) as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

.

**Blocked**: Disallowed features and configuration options are blocked via add-on managed admission webhooks. The API server immediately publishes the error message to the user that the feature is disallowed.**Supported**: Supported features receive support from Azure support.**Allowed**: Allowed features are open and available to Istio add-on users but aren't covered by Azure support.

# Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

The AKS scheduling mechanism is responsible for placing pods onto nodes and is based upon the upstream Kubernetes scheduler, [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/). You can constrain a pod to run on particular nodes by attaching the pods to a set of nodes using [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or by instructing the node to repel a set of pods using [node taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/), which interact with the AKS scheduler.

Node taints work by marking a node so that the scheduler avoids placing certain pods on the marked nodes. You can place [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) on a pod to allow the scheduler to schedule that pod on a node with a matching taint. Taints and tolerations work together to help you control how the scheduler places pods onto nodes. For more information, see [example use cases of taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases:%7E:text=not%20be%20evicted.-,Example%20Use%20Cases,-Taints%20and%20tolerations).

Taints are key-value pairs with an [effect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/). There are three values for the effect field when using node taints: `NoExecute`

, `NoSchedule`

, and `PreferNoSchedule`

.

`NoExecute`

: Pods already running on the node are immediately evicted if they don't have a matching toleration. If a pod has a matching toleration, it might be evicted if`tolerationSeconds`

are specified.`NoSchedule`

: Only pods with a matching toleration are placed on this node. Existing pods aren't evicted.`PreferNoSchedule`

: The scheduler avoids placing any pods that don't have a matching toleration.

### Node taint options

There are two types of node taints that can be applied to your AKS nodes: **node taints** and **node initialization taints**.

**Node taints**are meant to remain permanently on the node for scheduling pods with node affinity. Node taints can only be added, updated, or removed completely using the AKS API.**Node initialization taints**are placed on the node at boot time and are meant to be used temporarily, such as in scenarios where you might need extra time to set up your nodes. You can remove node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API and they aren't guaranteed during the node lifecycle. They will appear on new replicas of the node when it is scaled up or on all replicas when a node is upgraded. If you want to remove the initialization taints completely, you can remove them using the AKS API after untainting the nodes using the Kubernetes API. Once you remove the initialization taints from the cluster spec using the AKS API, newly created nodes don't come up with those initialization taints. If the initialization taint is still present on existing nodes, you can permanently remove it by performing a node image upgrade operation.

Note

Node taints and labels applied using the AKS node pool API aren't modifiable from the Kubernetes API and vice versa. Modifications to system taints aren't allowed.

This doesn't apply to node initialization taints.

## Use node taints

### Prerequisites

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a node pool with a node taint

Create a node pool with a taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool add`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


### Update a node pool to add a node taint

Update a node pool to add a node taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool update`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


## Use node initialization taints (preview)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Prerequisites and limitations

- You need the Azure CLI version
`3.0.0b3`

or later installed and configured. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can only apply initialization taints via cluster create or upgrade when using the AKS API. If using ARM template that will result in a Managed Cluster level operation, you can specify node initialization taints during node pool creation and update. Agentpool level operations are blocked when
`NodeInitializationTaints`

are present in the request body. - You can't apply initialization taints to Windows node pools using the Azure CLI.

### Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a cluster with a node initialization taint

Create a cluster with a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks create`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

The node initialization taints you specify apply to all of the node pools in the cluster. To apply the initialization taint to a specific node, you can use an ARM template instead of the CLI.

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint

Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

When updating a cluster with a node initialization taint, the taints apply to all node pools in the cluster. If your nodes are using VMSS, you can view updates to node initialization taints on the node after the node's VMSS model is updated (for example, after a node image version upgrade operation). Initialization taints will not appear on your nodes until an operation that triggers a VMSS model update occurs.

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`


## Check the status of the node pool

After applying the node taint or initialization taint, check the status of the node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`

If you applied node initialization taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeInitializationTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeInitializationTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`


## Check that the taint is set on the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool has the specified`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: sku=gpu:NoSchedule ... ], ... ... ]`


Important

If your nodes are using VMSS, node initialization taints will not be visible on actual nodes in your cluster until an operation that triggers VMSS model update occurs (for example, Kubernetes version upgrade or node image version upgrade).

## Remove node taints

### Remove a specific node taint

Remove node taints using the

command. The following example command removes the`az aks nodepool update`

`"sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`

node taint from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


### Remove all node taints

Remove all node taints from a node pool using the

command. The following example command removes all node taints from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


## Remove node initialization taints

You have the following options to remove node initialization taints from the node:

**Remove node initialization taints temporarily**using the Kubernetes API. If you remove them this way, the taints reappear after node scaling or upgrade occurs. New nodes still have the node initialization taint after scaling. Node initialization taints appear on all nodes after upgrading.**Remove node initialization taints permanently**by untainting the node using the Kubernetes API, and then removing the taint using the AKS API. Once the initialization taints are removed from cluster spec using AKS API, newly created nodes after reimage operations no longer have initialization taints.

When you remove all initialization taint occurrences from node pool replicas, the existing initialization taint might reappear after an upgrade with any new initialization taints.

### Remove node initialization taints temporarily

Remove node initialization taints temporarily using the

`kubectl taint nodes`

command.This command removes the taint from only the specified node. If you want to remove the taint from every node in the node pool, you need to run the command for every node that you want the taint removed from.

`kubectl taint nodes $NODE_POOL_NAME sku=gpu:NoSchedule-`

Once removed, node initialization taints reappear after node scaling or upgrading occurs.


### Remove node initialization taints permanently

Follow steps in

[Remove node initialization taints temporarily](#remove-node-initialization-taints-temporarily)to remove the node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API.Remove the taint from the node using the AKS API using the

command. This command removes the node initialization taint from every node in the cluster.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints ""`


## Check that the taint has been removed from the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you removed a node taint, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool doesn't have the removed taint under`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: ... ], ... ... ]`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes the node images available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

Important

Starting on **March 17, 2027**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=485795). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on March 01, 2026, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2019 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.33+ can't use Windows Server 2019. Starting on April 01, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=aks-will-stop-support-for-windows-server-2019-on-march-1-2026). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on March 15, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2022 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.36+ can't use Windows Server 2022. Starting on April 01, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=ws2022-retirement-aks). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Older node images can contain unpatched security vulnerabilities and might not work properly with recently released features. Using older images might lead to issues with scaling, node readiness, and security. Depending on the age of the image version, it could also place the cluster outside of the support scope until you perform a node image upgrade. **We recommend that you keep node images current and enable automatic upgrades**.

## Node image releases

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) regularly provides new node images, so it's beneficial to upgrade your node images frequently to access the latest AKS features, component updates, and security fixes. You can find detailed summaries of each node image version in the [AKS VHD notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/tree/master/vhd-notes).

Linux node images are released weekly, and Windows node images are released monthly. New node images are included in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).


Best practice guidanceConfigure

[automatic node image upgrades]and schedule them using[planned maintenance]. This will ensure that your node images are always up to date without requiring manual upgrades.

When new node images are released, it can take up to two weeks for the updates to be rolled out across all regions. The [AKS Release Tracker](release-tracker) shows the current latest node image version, three previously available node image versions for each region, and the node image update order by region. Once the node image is available in your region, you can perform a [manual node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) or configure [automatic node image upgrades](auto-upgrade-node-os-image) and schedule them using [planned maintenance](planned-maintenance).

## Default node images

AKS sets a default operating system (OS) and node image during cluster and node pool creation. OS Type can be used to filter between Linux or Windows.

| OS Type | Default OS | Default node image |
|---|---|---|
| Not Specified | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2 |
| Linux | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2 |
| Windows | Windows Server | Windows Server Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) with containerd and gen 1 |

Note

You can't specify the Windows OS Type during cluster creation since the system node pool in every cluster must be Linux.

### Factors that influence the default node image

The following factors influence the default image AKS chooses for your node pool:

**OS SKU**: If`--os-sku`

is specified, then your default OS changes. For example, if you specify Azure Linux as the OS SKU, then your node image is Azure Linux with containerd.**Virtual machine (VM) size**:**Hypervisor generation**: Each VM size supports Generation 1,[Generation 2](generation-2-vm), or both.- If Generation 2 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 2 node image in all OS versions except for Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022.
- If only Generation 1 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 1 node image. Generation 1 isn't supported for Azure Linux OS Guard (preview) or Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview).

**Feature enablement**: There are some features embedded into the node image. If you choose to use any of these features, your default node image changes.[Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](enable-fips-nodes)changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.[Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing)changes the default node image for Azure Linux node pools.[Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch)changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.


Note

Certain features can't be combined in a single node pool. Follow links to the feature documentation to review the limitations.

# Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy an application that uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI on AKS. With OpenAI, you can easily adapt different AI models, such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code generation, for your specific tasks. You start by deploying an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Then, you deploy your OpenAI service and the sample application.

The sample cloud native application is representative of real-world implementations. The multi-container application is comprised of applications written in multiple languages and frameworks, including:

- Golang with Gin
- Rust with Actix-Web
- JavaScript with Vue.js and Fastify
- Python with FastAPI

These applications provide front ends for customers and store admins, REST APIs for sending data to RabbitMQ message queue and MongoDB database, and console apps to simulate traffic.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

To access the GitHub codebase for the sample application, see [AKS Store Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - For this demo, you can either use Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI service.
- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the
[Request access to Azure OpenAI Service form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). - If you plan on using OpenAI, sign up on the
[OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is a logical group in which you deploy and manage Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

The following example output shows successful creation of the resource group:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup", "location": "eastus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroup", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup*.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`

Note

If your Linux-based system requires elevated permissions, you can use the

`sudo az aks install-cli`

command.Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

This command executes the following operations:

- Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
- Uses
`~/.kube/config`

, the default location for the[Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using*--file*argument.

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is

*Ready*.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6`


Note

For private clusters, the nodes might be unreachable if you try to connect to them through the public IP address. In order to fix this, you need to create an endpoint within the same VNET as the cluster to connect from. Follow the instructions to [Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters) and then connect to it.

## Deploy the application

The [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Makeline service**: Processes orders from the queue and completes the orders.**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Store admin**: Web application for store employees to view orders in the queue and manage product information.**Virtual customer**: Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis.**Virtual worker**: Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis.**Mongo DB**: NoSQL instance for persisted data.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

Review the

[YAML manifest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml)for the application.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/mongodb created service/mongodb created deployment.apps/rabbitmq created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/makeline-service created service/makeline-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created deployment.apps/store-admin created service/store-admin created deployment.apps/virtual-customer created deployment.apps/virtual-worker created`


## Deploy OpenAI

You can either use Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and run your application on AKS.

- In the Azure portal, create an Azure OpenAI instance.
- Navigate to the Azure OpenAI instance you created.
- From the
**Overview**blade, navigate to the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). - Create a new
**Chat**deployment using the**gpt-4o-mini**base model.

For more information on how to create a deployment in Azure OpenAI, see [Get started generating text using Azure OpenAI Service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Deploy the AI service

Now that the application is deployed, you can deploy the Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to automatically generate descriptions for new products being added to the store's catalog.

Create a file named

`ai-service.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "" - name: OPENAI_API_KEY value: "" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ai-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 5001 targetPort: 5001 selector: app: ai-service`

Set the environment variable

`USE_AZURE_OPENAI`

to`"True"`

.Get your Azure OpenAI deployment name from

[Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/portal/)and fill in the`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

value.Get your Azure OpenAI endpoint and Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure portal by selecting

**Keys and Endpoint**in the left blade of the resource. Update the`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

and`OPENAI_API_KEY`

in the YAML accordingly.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ai-service.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/ai-service created service/ai-service created`


Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use [Managed Identity](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity#authorize-access-to-managed-identities) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI service instead or store your secrets in [Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).

## Test the application

Check the status of the deployed pods using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods`

Make sure all the pods are

*Running*before continuing to the next step.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE makeline-service-7db94dc7d4-8g28l 1/1 Running 0 99s mongodb-78f6d95f8-nptbz 1/1 Running 0 99s order-service-55cbd784bb-6bmfb 1/1 Running 0 99s product-service-6bf4d65f74-7cbvk 1/1 Running 0 99s rabbitmq-9855984f9-94nlm 1/1 Running 0 99s store-admin-7f7d768c48-9hn8l 1/1 Running 0 99s store-front-6786c64d97-xq5s9 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-customer-79498f8667-xzsb7 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-worker-6d77fff4b5-7g7rj 1/1 Running 0 99s`

Get the IP of the store admin web application and store front web application using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-admin`

The application exposes the Store Admin site to the internet via a public load balancer provisioned by the Kubernetes service. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

**EXTERNAL IP**initially shows*pending*until the service comes up and shows the IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE store-admin LoadBalancer 10.0.142.228 40.64.86.161 80:32494/TCP 50m`

Repeat the same step for the service named `store-front``.

Open a web browser and browse to the external IP address of your service. In the example shown here, open

*40.64.86.161*to see Store Admin in the browser. Repeat the same step for Store Front.In store admin, select the products tab, then select

**Add Products**.When the `ai-service`` is running successfully, you should see the Ask OpenAI button next to the description field. Fill in the name, price, and keywords, then generate a product description by selecting

**Ask OpenAI**>**Save product**.You can now see the new product you created on Store Admin used by sellers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added.

You can also see the new product you created on Store Front used by buyers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added. Remember to get the IP address of store front using the

command.`kubectl get service`

# Best practices for application developers to manage resources in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few key areas to consider. The way you manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services you provide.

This article focuses on running your clusters and workloads from an application developer perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

This article covers the following topics:

- Pod resource requests and limits.
- Ways to develop, debug, and deploy applications with Bridge to Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code.

## Define pod resource requests and limits


Best practice guidanceSet pod requests and limits on all pods in your YAML manifests. If the AKS cluster uses

resource quotasand you don't define these values, your deployment may be rejected.

Use pod requests and limits to manage compute resources within an AKS cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler of the compute resources to assign to a pod.

### Pod CPU/Memory requests

*Pod requests* define a set amount of CPU and memory the pod needs regularly.

In your pod specifications, it's important you define these requests and limits based on the above information. If you don't include these values, the Kubernetes scheduler can't consider the resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

Monitor the performance of your application to adjust pod requests. If you underestimate pod requests, your application may receive degraded performance due to over-scheduling a node. If requests are overestimated, your application may have increased scheduling difficulty.

### Pod CPU/Memory limits

*Pod limits* set the maximum amount of CPU and memory a pod can use. *Memory limits* define which pods should be removed when nodes are unstable due to insufficient resources. Without proper limits set, pods are removed until resource pressure is lifted. While a pod may exceed the *CPU limit* periodically, the pod isn't removed for exceeding the CPU limit.

Pod limits define when a pod loses control of resource consumption. When it exceeds the limit, the pod is marked for removal. This behavior maintains node health and minimizes impact to pods sharing the node. If you don't set a pod limit, it defaults to the highest available value on a given node.

Avoid setting a pod limit higher than your nodes can support. Each AKS node reserves a set amount of CPU and memory for the core Kubernetes components. Your application may try to consume too many resources on the node for other pods to successfully run.

Monitor the performance of your application at different times during the day or week. Determine peak demand times and align the pod limits to the resources required to meet maximum needs.

Important

In your pod specifications, define these requests and limits based on the above information. Failing to include these values prevents the Kubernetes scheduler from accounting for resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

If the scheduler places a pod on a node with insufficient resources, application performance is degraded. Cluster administrators **must set resource quotas** on a namespace that requires you to set resource requests and limits. For more information, see

[resource quotas on AKS clusters](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas).

When you define a CPU request or limit, the value is measured in CPU units.

*1.0*CPU equates to one underlying virtual CPU core on the node.- The same measurement is used for GPUs.

- You can define fractions measured in millicores. For example,
*100 m*is*0.1*of an underlying vCPU core.

In the following basic example for a single NGINX pod, the pod requests *100 m* of CPU time and *128Mi* of memory. The resource limits for the pod are set to *250 m* CPU and *256Mi* memory.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
- name: mypod
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
resources:
requests:
cpu: 100m
memory: 128Mi
limits:
cpu: 250m

## Develop and debug applications against an AKS cluster


Best practice guidanceDevelopment teams should deploy and debug against an AKS cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes.


With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can develop, debug, and test applications directly against an AKS cluster. Developers within a team collaborate to build and test throughout the application lifecycle. You can continue to use existing tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Using integrated development and test process with Bridge to Kubernetes reduces the need for local test environments like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). Instead, you develop and test against an AKS cluster, even in secured and isolated clusters.

Note

Bridge to Kubernetes is intended for use with applications running on Linux pods and nodes.

## Use the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for Kubernetes


Best practice guidanceInstall and use the VS Code extension for Kubernetes when you write YAML manifests. You can also use the extension for integrated deployment solution, which may help application owners that infrequently interact with the AKS cluster.


The [Visual Studio Code extension for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) helps you develop and deploy applications to AKS. The extension provides the following features:

Intellisense for Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and templates.

The ability to browse, deploy, and edit capabilities for Kubernetes resources from within VS Code.

Intellisense checks for resource requests or limits being set in the pod specifications:


## Next steps

This article focused on how to run your cluster and workloads from a cluster operator perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

CLI installed and updated. Install it locally using the`az aks install-cli`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use throughout the article. Replace the placeholder values with your own values.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export LOCATION="<location>" export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>" export DNS_NAME_PREFIX="<dns-name-prefix>"`


## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group for the AKS cluster using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

,`--enable-managed-identity`

,`--enable-aad`

, and`--dns-name-prefix`

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS monitoring requires multiple levels of observability across platform metrics, Prometheus metrics, activity logs, resource logs, and container insights. AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| Platform metrics |
|

[enable metric scraping](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for your cluster, the[managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)in Azure Monitor collects[Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default)and stores them in an[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview). Analyze these metrics using[prebuilt dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin#use-out-of-the-box-dashboards)in[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)and with[Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/prometheus-alerts).[activity log](monitor-aks-reference)automatically collects some data for AKS clusters at no cost. These log files track information like when a cluster is created or changes are made to a cluster configuration. To analyze activity log data with your other log data,[send activity log data to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log#send-to-log-analytics-workspace).[Create a diagnostic setting](#aks-control-plane-resource-logs)to[send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). In the workspace, you can analyze the logs using queries and set up alerts based on log information.[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)and in[Azure Monitor metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|
| Count logs for each category | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS"` | `summarize count() by Category` |
| All API server logs | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| All kube-audit logs in a time range | Azure diagnostics mode | `let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23");` `let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24");` `AzureDiagnostics` | `where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)` | `where Category == "kube-audit"` | `extend event = parse_json(log_s)` | `extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)` | `extend User = tostring(event.user.username)` | `extend Apiserver = pod_s` | `extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])` | `project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event` |
| All audit logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSAudit` |
All audit logs excluding the `get` and `list` audit events |
Resource-specific mode | `AKSAuditAdmin` |
| All API server logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSControlPlane` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |

To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries#queries-interface), and select the **Kubernetes Services** resource type. For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs


Private cluster network requirements: To access logs from a private cluster, you must use a computer that's in the same private network as the cluster.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your AKS cluster.Under

**Kubernetes resources**, select**Workloads**.For

**Deployment**,**Pod**,**Replica Set**,**Stateful Set**,**Job**, or**Cron Job**, select a value, and then select**Live Logs**.Select a resource log to view.

The following example shows the logs for a pod resource:

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved. For more information, see[Azure Monitor REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/filter-syntax).**Logs:**Use the REST API or the[associated client libraries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).Another option is the

[workspace data export](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal).

To get started with the REST API for Azure Monitor, see

[Azure monitoring REST API walkthrough](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough?tabs=portal).

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

## AKS node network metrics monitoring


Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).

AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

In the workspace, you can analyze the logs using queries and set up alerts based on log information.[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)and in[Azure Monitor metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|
| Count logs for each category | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS"` | `summarize count() by Category` |
| All API server logs | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| All kube-audit logs in a time range | Azure diagnostics mode | `let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23");` `let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24");` `AzureDiagnostics` | `where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)` | `where Category == "kube-audit"` | `extend event = parse_json(log_s)` | `extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)` | `extend User = tostring(event.user.username)` | `extend Apiserver = pod_s` | `extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])` | `project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event` |
| All audit logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSAudit` |
All audit logs excluding the `get` and `list` audit events |
Resource-specific mode | `AKSAuditAdmin` |
| All API server logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSControlPlane` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |

To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries#queries-interface), and select the **Kubernetes Services** resource type. For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

The complete audit policy used in AKS is available for review in the following collapsible section.

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs


Private cluster network requirements: To access logs from a private cluster, you must use a computer that's in the same private network as the cluster.

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved. For more information, see[Azure Monitor REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/filter-syntax).**Logs:**Use the REST API or the[associated client libraries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).Another option is the

[workspace data export](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal).

To get started with the REST API for Azure Monitor, see

[Azure monitoring REST API walkthrough](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough?tabs=portal).

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

## AKS node network metrics monitoring


Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS monitoring requires multiple levels of observability across platform metrics, Prometheus metrics, activity logs, resource logs, and container insights. AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| Platform metrics |

Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|
| Count logs for each category | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS"` | `summarize count() by Category` |
| All API server logs | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| All kube-audit logs in a time range | Azure diagnostics mode | `let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23");` `let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24");` `AzureDiagnostics` | `where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)` | `where Category == "kube-audit"` | `extend event = parse_json(log_s)` | `extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)` | `extend User = tostring(event.user.username)` | `extend Apiserver = pod_s` | `extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])` | `project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event` |
| All audit logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSAudit` |
All audit logs excluding the `get` and `list` audit events |
Resource-specific mode | `AKSAuditAdmin` |
| All API server logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSControlPlane` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |

To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries#queries-interface), and select the **Kubernetes Services** resource type. For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

The complete audit policy used in AKS is available for review in the following collapsible section.

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved.

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

## AKS node network metrics monitoring


Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS monitoring requires multiple levels of observability across platform metrics, Prometheus metrics, activity logs, resource logs, and container insights. AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| Platform metrics |

Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

The complete audit policy used in AKS is available for review in the following collapsible section.

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs


Private cluster network requirements: To access logs from a private cluster, you must use a computer that's in the same private network as the cluster.

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved. For more information, see[Azure Monitor REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/filter-syntax).**Logs:**Use the REST API or the[associated client libraries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).Another option is the

[workspace data export](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal).

To get started with the REST API for Azure Monitor, see

[Azure monitoring REST API walkthrough](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough?tabs=portal).

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).

# Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy an application that uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI on AKS. With OpenAI, you can easily adapt different AI models, such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code generation, for your specific tasks. You start by deploying an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Then, you deploy your OpenAI service and the sample application.

The sample cloud native application is representative of real-world implementations. The multi-container application is comprised of applications written in multiple languages and frameworks, including:

- Golang with Gin
- Rust with Actix-Web
- JavaScript with Vue.js and Fastify
- Python with FastAPI

These applications provide front ends for customers and store admins, REST APIs for sending data to RabbitMQ message queue and MongoDB database, and console apps to simulate traffic.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

To access the GitHub codebase for the sample application, see [AKS Store Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - For this demo, you can either use Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI service.
- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the
[Request access to Azure OpenAI Service form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). - If you plan on using OpenAI, sign up on the
[OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is a logical group in which you deploy and manage Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

The following example output shows successful creation of the resource group:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup", "location": "eastus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroup", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup*.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`

Note

If your Linux-based system requires elevated permissions, you can use the

`sudo az aks install-cli`

command.Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

This command executes the following operations:

- Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
- Uses
`~/.kube/config`

, the default location for the[Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using*--file*argument.

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is

*Ready*.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6`


Note

For private clusters, the nodes might be unreachable if you try to connect to them through the public IP address. In order to fix this, you need to create an endpoint within the same VNET as the cluster to connect from. Follow the instructions to [Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters) and then connect to it.

## Deploy the application

The [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Makeline service**: Processes orders from the queue and completes the orders.**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Store admin**: Web application for store employees to view orders in the queue and manage product information.**Virtual customer**: Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis.**Virtual worker**: Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis.**Mongo DB**: NoSQL instance for persisted data.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

Review the

[YAML manifest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml)for the application.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/mongodb created service/mongodb created deployment.apps/rabbitmq created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/makeline-service created service/makeline-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created deployment.apps/store-admin created service/store-admin created deployment.apps/virtual-customer created deployment.apps/virtual-worker created`


## Deploy OpenAI

You can either use Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and run your application on AKS.

- In the Azure portal, create an Azure OpenAI instance.
- Navigate to the Azure OpenAI instance you created.
- From the
**Overview**blade, navigate to the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). - Create a new
**Chat**deployment using the**gpt-4o-mini**base model.

For more information on how to create a deployment in Azure OpenAI, see [Get started generating text using Azure OpenAI Service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Deploy the AI service

Now that the application is deployed, you can deploy the Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to automatically generate descriptions for new products being added to the store's catalog.

Create a file named

`ai-service.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "" - name: OPENAI_API_KEY value: "" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ai-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 5001 targetPort: 5001 selector: app: ai-service`

Set the environment variable

`USE_AZURE_OPENAI`

to`"True"`

.Get your Azure OpenAI deployment name from

[Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/portal/)and fill in the`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

value.Get your Azure OpenAI endpoint and Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure portal by selecting

**Keys and Endpoint**in the left blade of the resource. Update the`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

and`OPENAI_API_KEY`

in the YAML accordingly.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ai-service.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/ai-service created service/ai-service created`


Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use [Managed Identity](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity#authorize-access-to-managed-identities) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI service instead or store your secrets in [Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).

## Test the application

Check the status of the deployed pods using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods`

Make sure all the pods are

*Running*before continuing to the next step.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE makeline-service-7db94dc7d4-8g28l 1/1 Running 0 99s mongodb-78f6d95f8-nptbz 1/1 Running 0 99s order-service-55cbd784bb-6bmfb 1/1 Running 0 99s product-service-6bf4d65f74-7cbvk 1/1 Running 0 99s rabbitmq-9855984f9-94nlm 1/1 Running 0 99s store-admin-7f7d768c48-9hn8l 1/1 Running 0 99s store-front-6786c64d97-xq5s9 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-customer-79498f8667-xzsb7 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-worker-6d77fff4b5-7g7rj 1/1 Running 0 99s`

Get the IP of the store admin web application and store front web application using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-admin`

The application exposes the Store Admin site to the internet via a public load balancer provisioned by the Kubernetes service. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

**EXTERNAL IP**initially shows*pending*until the service comes up and shows the IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE store-admin LoadBalancer 10.0.142.228 40.64.86.161 80:32494/TCP 50m`

Repeat the same step for the service named `store-front``.

Open a web browser and browse to the external IP address of your service. In the example shown here, open

*40.64.86.161*to see Store Admin in the browser. Repeat the same step for Store Front.In store admin, select the products tab, then select

**Add Products**.When the `ai-service`` is running successfully, you should see the Ask OpenAI button next to the description field. Fill in the name, price, and keywords, then generate a product description by selecting

**Ask OpenAI**>**Save product**.You can now see the new product you created on Store Admin used by sellers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added.

You can also see the new product you created on Store Front used by buyers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added. Remember to get the IP address of store front using the

command.`kubectl get service`

# Best practices for application developers to manage resources in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few key areas to consider. The way you manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services you provide.

This article focuses on running your clusters and workloads from an application developer perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

This article covers the following topics:

- Pod resource requests and limits.
- Ways to develop, debug, and deploy applications with Bridge to Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code.

## Define pod resource requests and limits


Best practice guidanceSet pod requests and limits on all pods in your YAML manifests. If the AKS cluster uses

resource quotasand you don't define these values, your deployment may be rejected.

Use pod requests and limits to manage compute resources within an AKS cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler of the compute resources to assign to a pod.

### Pod CPU/Memory requests

*Pod requests* define a set amount of CPU and memory the pod needs regularly.

In your pod specifications, it's important you define these requests and limits based on the above information. If you don't include these values, the Kubernetes scheduler can't consider the resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

Monitor the performance of your application to adjust pod requests. If you underestimate pod requests, your application may receive degraded performance due to over-scheduling a node. If requests are overestimated, your application may have increased scheduling difficulty.

### Pod CPU/Memory limits

*Pod limits* set the maximum amount of CPU and memory a pod can use. *Memory limits* define which pods should be removed when nodes are unstable due to insufficient resources. Without proper limits set, pods are removed until resource pressure is lifted. While a pod may exceed the *CPU limit* periodically, the pod isn't removed for exceeding the CPU limit.

Pod limits define when a pod loses control of resource consumption. When it exceeds the limit, the pod is marked for removal. This behavior maintains node health and minimizes impact to pods sharing the node. If you don't set a pod limit, it defaults to the highest available value on a given node.

Avoid setting a pod limit higher than your nodes can support. Each AKS node reserves a set amount of CPU and memory for the core Kubernetes components. Your application may try to consume too many resources on the node for other pods to successfully run.

Monitor the performance of your application at different times during the day or week. Determine peak demand times and align the pod limits to the resources required to meet maximum needs.

Important

In your pod specifications, define these requests and limits based on the above information. Failing to include these values prevents the Kubernetes scheduler from accounting for resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

If the scheduler places a pod on a node with insufficient resources, application performance is degraded. Cluster administrators **must set resource quotas** on a namespace that requires you to set resource requests and limits. For more information, see

[resource quotas on AKS clusters](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas).

When you define a CPU request or limit, the value is measured in CPU units.

*1.0*CPU equates to one underlying virtual CPU core on the node.- The same measurement is used for GPUs.

- You can define fractions measured in millicores. For example,
*100 m*is*0.1*of an underlying vCPU core.

In the following basic example for a single NGINX pod, the pod requests *100 m* of CPU time and *128Mi* of memory. The resource limits for the pod are set to *250 m* CPU and *256Mi* memory.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
- name: mypod
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
resources:
requests:
cpu: 100m
memory: 128Mi
limits:
cpu: 250m
memory: 256Mi
```


For more information about resource measurements and assignments, see [Managing compute resources for containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/).

## Develop and debug applications against an AKS cluster


Best practice guidanceDevelopment teams should deploy and debug against an AKS cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes.


With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can develop, debug, and test applications directly against an AKS cluster. Developers within a team collaborate to build and test throughout the application lifecycle. You can continue to use existing tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Using integrated development and test process with Bridge to Kubernetes reduces the need for local test environments like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). Instead, you develop and test against an AKS cluster, even in secured and isolated clusters.

Note

Bridge to Kubernetes is intended for use with applications running on Linux pods and nodes.

## Use the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for Kubernetes


Best practice guidanceInstall and use the VS Code extension for Kubernetes when you write YAML manifests. You can also use the extension for integrated deployment solution, which may help application owners that infrequently interact with the AKS cluster.


The [Visual Studio Code extension for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) helps you develop and deploy applications to AKS. The extension provides the following features:

Intellisense for Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and templates.

The ability to browse, deploy, and edit capabilities for Kubernetes resources from within VS Code.

Intellisense checks for resource requests or limits being set in the pod specifications:

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

CLI installed and updated. Install it locally using the`az aks install-cli`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use throughout the article. Replace the placeholder values with your own values.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export LOCATION="<location>" export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>" export DNS_NAME_PREFIX="<dns-name-prefix>"`


## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group for the AKS cluster using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

,`--enable-managed-identity`

,`--enable-aad`

, and`--dns-name-prefix`

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

As your application workload demands change, you might need to scale the number of nodes in a node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this article, you learn how to manually and automatically scale node pools in AKS.

## Prerequisites for AKS node pool scaling

- An existing AKS cluster with at least one node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with node pools](create-node-pools). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Scale a node pool manually

Scale the number of nodes in a node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool scale`

][az-aks-nodepool-scale] command. The`--node-count`

flag specifies the desired number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the node pool is scaled to five nodes.`az aks nodepool scale \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --node-count 5 \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pools using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Scaling*state with a new count of five nodes:`[ { ... "count": 5, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Scaling", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes for the scale operation to complete. After the scale operation is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Scale a node pool automatically with the cluster autoscaler

You can use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) with multiple node pools, and you can enable it on individual node pools and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

flag. The`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

flags specify the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the cluster autoscaler is enabled with a minimum count of one node and a maximum count of five nodes:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

If you want to disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool, use the [`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the `--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

flag instead of `--update-cluster-autoscaler`

.

# Start and stop an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pool

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You might not need to continuously run your AKS workloads. For example, you might have a development cluster that has node pools running specific workloads. To optimize your compute costs, you can completely stop your node pools in your AKS cluster.

## Features and limitations

- You can't stop system pools.
- Spot node pools are supported.
- Stopped node pools can be upgraded.
- The cluster and node pool must be running.
- You can't stop node pools from clusters which use the
[Node Autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision)feature.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to stop and start your node pools in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#start-and-stop-node-pools).

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using the [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

## Stop an AKS node pool

Stop a running AKS node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool stop`

`az aks nodepool stop --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

Verify your node pool stopped using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

The following condensed example output shows the

`powerState`

as`Stopped`

:`{ [...] "osType": "Linux", "podSubnetId": null, "powerState": { "code": "Stopped" }, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "proximityPlacementGroupId": null, [...] }`

Note

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Stopping`

, your node pool is still in the process of stopping.Note

Stopping the node pool will stop its Cluster Autoscaler, and starts it back when starting the node pool. So if you manually modify the number of VMSS instances in the pool while it's stopped, Cluster Autoscaler might show inconsistencies.


## Start a stopped AKS node pool

Restart a stopped node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool start`

`az aks nodepool start --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

Verify your node pool started using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

The following condensed example output shows the

`powerState`

as`Running`

:`{ [...] "osType": "Linux", "podSubnetId": null, "powerState": { "code": "Running" }, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "proximityPlacementGroupId": null, [...] }`

Note

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Starting`

, your node pool is still in the process of starting.

# Automated deployments for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Automated Deployments streamline the process of setting up a GitHub Action or Azure DevOps Pipeline, making it easy to create a continuous deployment pipeline for your application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Once connected, every new commit automatically triggers the pipeline, delivering updates to your application seamlessly. You can either bring your own deployment files for quick pipeline creation or generate Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests to containerize and deploy non-containerized applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account or an Azure DevOps organization.
- An AKS cluster. If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - An Azure Container Registry (ACR). If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Integrate Azure Container Registry (ACR) with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](cluster-container-registry-integration). - An application to deploy.

### Connect to source code repository

Create an automated deployment workflow and authorize it to connect to the desired source code repository.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Automated deployments**>**Create**. - Under
**Repository details**, enter a name for the workflow, then select**GitHub or ADO**for your repository location. - Select
**Authorize access**to connect to the desired repository. - Choose the
**Repository**and**Branch**, and then select**Next**.

### Choose the container image configuration

To get an application ready for Kubernetes, you need to build it into a container image and store it in a container registry. You use a Dockerfile to provide instructions on how to build the container image. If your source code repository doesn't already have a Dockerfile, Automated Deployments can generate one for you. Otherwise, you can use an existing Dockerfile.

Use Automated Deployments to generate a Dockerfile for many languages and frameworks such as Go, C#, Node.js, Python, Java, Gradle, Clojure, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Swift, and Rust. The language support is built on what's available in [draft.sh](https://draft.sh).

- Select
**Auto-containerize (generate Dockerfile)**for the container configuration. - Select the
**location of where to save the generated Dockerfile**in the repository. - Select the
**application environment**from the list of supported languages and frameworks. - Enter the
**application port**. - Provide the
**Dockerfile build context**path. - Select an existing
**Azure Container Registry**or create a new one. This registry is used to store the built application image.

### Choose the Kubernetes manifest configuration

Note

The Generate Manifests option also supports advanced features like Service Connector integration, auto-generated Ingress resources, and more detailed, customizable Kubernetes manifest files.

An application running on Kubernetes consists of many Kubernetes primitive components. These components describe what container image to use, how many replicas to run, if there's a public IP required to expose the application, etc. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation][kubernetes-documentation]. If your source code repository doesn't already have the basic Kubernetes manifests to deploy, Automated Deployments can generate them for you. Otherwise, you can use a set of existing manifests. You can also choose an existing Helm chart.

If your code repository already has a Dockerfile, you can select it to be used to build the application image.

- Select
**Use existing Kubernetes manifest deployment files**for the deployment options. - Select the
**Kubernetes manifest file or folder**from your repository. - Select
**Next**.

## (Optional) Use a managed ingress and/or Service Connector

When generating Kubernetes manifests with Automated Deployments, you can optionally enable App Routing to set up an ingress controller for your application. You can also use Service Connector to create a new connection or seamlessly integrate your app with an existing Azure service backend.

App Routing provides a fully managed NGINX-based ingress controller out of the box, complete with built-in SSL/TLS encryption using certificates stored in Azure Key Vault and DNS zone management through Azure DNS. When using Automated Deployments, the expose ingress command integrates seamlessly with App Routing, making it easy to expose your application to external traffic under a secure, custom DNS name—with minimal configuration.

- Select the
**Expose ingress**box. - Choose between an
**Existing ingress controller**or a**New ingress controller**. - Choose between using a
**SSL/TLS enabled**or**Insecure**ingress controller. - (Optional) Enter
**Certificate details**if choosing a**SSL/TLS enabled**ingress controller. - Choose between using
**Azure DNS**or a**3rd party provider**. - Enter the
**Azure DNS Zone**and**Subdomain name**.

## (Optional) Add environment variables

Define environment variables for a container in Kubernetes by specifying name-value pairs. Environment variables are important as they help enable easier management of settings, secure handling of sensitive information, and flexibility across environments.

## Review configuration and deploy

Review the configuration for the application, and Kubernetes manifests, then select **Deploy**. A pull request (PR) will be generated against the repository that you selected, so don't navigate away from deployment page.

### Review and merge pull request

When the deployment succeeds, select **View pull request** to view the details of the generated pull request on your code repository.

- Review the changes under
**Files changed**and make any desired edits. - Select
**Merge pull request**to merge the changes into your code repository.

Merging the change runs the GitHub Actions workflow that builds your application into a container image, stores it in Azure Container Registry, and deploys it to the cluster.

### Check the deployed resources

After the pipeline is completed, you can review the created Kubernetes `Service`

in the Azure portal by selecting **Services and ingresses** under the **Kubernetes resources** section of the service menu.

Selecting the **External IP** should open up a new browser page with the running application.

## Delete resources

Once you're done with your cluster, use the following steps to delete it to avoid incurring Azure charges:

- In the Azure portal, navigate to
**Automated deployments** - Select
**...**on the pipeline of your choice. - Select
**Delete**.

# Upgrade Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article addresses upgrade experiences for Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To learn more about the release schedule and support for service mesh add-on revisions, read the [support policy](istio-support-policy#versioning-and-support-policy).

## Minor revision upgrade

Istio add-on allows upgrading the minor revision using [canary upgrade process](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/). When an upgrade is initiated, the control plane of the new (canary) revision is deployed alongside the initial (stable) revision's control plane. You can then manually roll over data plane workloads while using monitoring tools to track the health of workloads during this process. If you don't observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can complete the upgrade so that only the new revision remains on the cluster. Else, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio.

Available upgrades depend on whether the current Istio revision and AKS cluster version are supported:

- You can upgrade to the
**next supported revision (**or skip one and upgrade to`n+1`

), as long as both are supported and compatible with the cluster version.`n+2`

- If both your current revision (
`n`

) and the next revision (`n+1`

) are unsupported, you can only upgrade to the**nearest supported revision (**, but not beyond it.`n+2`

or higher) - If the cluster version and Istio revision are both unsupported, the cluster version must be upgraded before an Istio upgrade can be initiated.

Note

Once an AKS version or mesh revision falls outside the support window, upgrading either version becomes error-prone. While such upgrades are **allowed** to recover to a supported version, **the upgrade process and the out-of-support versions themselves are both not supported by Microsoft**. We strongly recommend keeping AKS version and mesh revision up to date to avoid running into unsupported scenarios. Refer to the [Istio add-on support calendar](istio-support-policy#service-mesh-add-on-release-calendar) for estimated release and end-of-life dates and the [upstream Istio release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/) for the new revision for notable changes.

The following example illustrates how to upgrade from revision `asm-1-23`

to `asm-1-24`

with all workloads in the `default`

namespace. The steps are the same for all minor upgrades and may be used for any number of namespaces.

Use the

[az aks mesh get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-upgrades)command to check which revisions are available for the cluster as upgrade targets:`az aks mesh get-upgrades --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

If you expect to see a newer revision not returned by this command, you may need to upgrade your AKS cluster first so that it's compatible with the newest revision.

If you set up

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)for the existing mesh revision on your cluster, you need to create a separate ConfigMap corresponding to the new revision in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace**before initiating the canary upgrade**in the next step. This configuration is applicable the moment the new revision's control plane is deployed on cluster. More details can be found[here](istio-meshconfig#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades).Initiate a canary upgrade from revision

`asm-1-23`

to`asm-1-24`

using[az aks mesh upgrade start](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh/upgrade#az-aks-mesh-upgrade-start):`az aks mesh upgrade start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --revision asm-1-24`

A canary upgrade means the 1.24 control plane is deployed alongside the 1.23 control plane. They continue to coexist until you either complete or roll back the upgrade.

While a canary upgrade is in progress, the higher revision is considered the

*default revision*used for validation of Istio resources.Optionally, revision tags may be used to roll over the data plane to the new revision without needing to manually relabel each namespace. Manually relabeling namespaces when moving them to a new revision can be tedious and error-prone.

[Revision tags](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/#stable-revision-labels)solve this problem by serving as stable identifiers that point to revisions.Rather than relabeling each namespace, a cluster operator can change the tag to point to a new revision. All namespaces labeled with that tag are updated at the same time. However, you still need to restart the workloads to make sure the correct version of

`istio-proxy`

sidecars are injected.To use revision tags during an upgrade:

Create a revision tag for the initial revision. In this example, we name it

`prod-stable`

:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Create a revision tag for the revision installed during the upgrade. In this example, we name it

`prod-canary`

:`istioctl tag set prod-canary --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Label application namespaces to map to revision tags:

`# label default namespace to map to asm-1-23 kubectl label ns default istio.io/rev=prod-stable --overwrite`

You may also label namespaces with

`istio.io/rev=prod-canary`

for the newer revision. However, the workloads in those namespaces aren't updated to a new sidecar until they're restarted.If a new application is created in a namespace after it is labeled, a sidecar will be injected corresponding to the revision tag on that namespace.


Verify control plane pods corresponding to both

`asm-1-23`

and`asm-1-24`

exist:Verify

`istiod`

pods:`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-system`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-dbzlt 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-fg8zh 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-7rwg4 1/1 Running 0 51m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-8p9qx 1/1 Running 0 51m`

If ingress is enabled, verify ingress pods:

`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-qkvq2 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-vhtd5 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-ft9c8 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-wcb6s 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-4cc2l 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-jjc7m 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-g89s4 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-krq9w 1/1 Running 0 51m`

Observe that ingress gateway pods of both revisions are deployed side-by-side. However, the service and its IP remain immutable.


Relabel the namespace so that any new pods are mapped to the Istio sidecar associated with the new revision and its control plane:

If using revision tags, overwrite the

`prod-stable`

tag itself to change its mapping:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Verify the tag-to-revision mappings:

`istioctl tag list`

Both tags should point to the newly installed revision:

`TAG REVISION NAMESPACES prod-canary asm-1-24 default prod-stable asm-1-24 ...`

In this case, you don't need to relabel each namespace individually.

If not using revision tags, data plane namespaces must be relabeled to point to the new revision:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-24 --overwrite`


Relabeling doesn't affect your workloads until they're restarted.

Individually roll over each of your application workloads by restarting them. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Check your monitoring tools and dashboards to determine whether your workloads are all running in a healthy state after the restart. Based on the outcome, you have two options:

**Complete the canary upgrade**: If you're satisfied that the workloads are all running in a healthy state as expected, you can complete the canary upgrade. Completion of the upgrade removes the previous revision's control plane and leaves behind the new revision's control plane on the cluster. Run the following command to complete the canary upgrade:`az aks mesh upgrade complete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

**Rollback the canary upgrade**: In case you observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio:

Relabel the namespace to the previous revision: If using revision tags:

`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Or, if not using revision tags:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-23 --overwrite`

Roll back the workloads to use the sidecar corresponding to the previous Istio revision by restarting these workloads again:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Roll back the control plane to the previous revision:

`az aks mesh upgrade rollback --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`


The

`prod-canary`

revision tag can be removed:`istioctl tag remove prod-canary --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

If

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)was previously set up for the revisions, you can now delete the ConfigMap for the revision that was removed from the cluster during complete/rollback.

### Minor revision upgrades with ingress and egress gateways

If you're currently using [Istio ingress gateways](istio-deploy-ingress) or [egress gateways](istio-deploy-egress) and are performing a minor revision upgrade, keep in mind that Istio ingress and egress gateway pods / deployments are deployed per-revision, but the service is shared across both revisions.

We provide a single `LoadBalancer`

service across all ingress gateway pods over multiple revisions, so the external/internal IP address of the ingress gateways remains unchanged throughout the course of an upgrade. Thus, during the canary upgrade, when two revisions exist simultaneously on the cluster, the ingress gateway pods of both revisions serve incoming traffic.

Likewise, during a canary upgrade, all pods for an egress gateway across both revisions will be served by a single `ClusterIP`

service.

### Minor revision upgrades with horizontal pod autoscaling customizations

If you have customized [horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) settings for Istiod or the ingress gateways](istio-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaling-customization), note the following behavior for how HPA settings are applied across both revisions to maintain consistency during a canary upgrade:

- If you update the HPA spec before initiating an upgrade, the settings from the existing (stable) revision will be applied to the HPAs of the canary revision when the new control plane is installed.
- If you update the HPA spec while a canary upgrade is in progress, the HPA spec of the stable revision will take precedence and be applied to the HPA of the canary revision.
- If you update the HPA of the stable revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be updated to reflect the new settings applied to the stable revision.
- If you update the HPA of the canary revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be reverted to the HPA spec of the stable revision.


## Patch version upgrade

- Istio add-on patch version availability information is published in
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - Patches are rolled out automatically for istiod and ingress pods as part of these AKS releases, which respect the
`default`

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)set up for the cluster. - User needs to initiate patches to Istio proxy in their workloads by restarting the pods for reinjection:
Check the version of the Istio proxy intended for new or restarted pods. This version is the same as the version of the istiod and Istio ingress pods after they were patched:

`kubectl get cm -n aks-istio-system -o yaml | grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless", "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless"`

Check the Istio proxy image version for all pods in a namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.23.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless`

To trigger reinjection, restart the workloads. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployments/productpage-v1 -n default`

To verify that they're now on the newer versions, check the Istio proxy image version again for all pods in the namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.2.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.24.0-distroless`

# Add Azure Dedicated Host to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Dedicated Host is a service that provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.

Using Azure Dedicated Hosts for nodes with your AKS cluster has the following benefits:

- Hardware isolation at the physical server level. No other VMs will be placed on your hosts. Dedicated hosts are deployed in the same data centers and share the same network and underlying storage infrastructure as other, non-isolated hosts.
- Control over maintenance events initiated by the Azure platform. While most maintenance events have little to no impact on your virtual machines, there are some sensitive workloads where each second of pause can have an impact. With dedicated hosts, you can opt in to a maintenance window to reduce the impact to your service.

## Before you begin

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Before you start, ensure that your version of the Azure CLI is 2.39.0 or later. If it's an earlier version,
[install the latest version](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate Azure Dedicated Host with Azure Kubernetes Service:

- Accelerated Networking
- An existing agent pool can't be converted from non-ADH to ADH or ADH to non-ADH.
- It isn't supported to update agent pool from host group A to host group B.
- Using ADH across subscriptions.

## Planning for ADH Capacity on AKS

Not all host SKUs are available in all regions, and availability zones. You can list host availability, and any offer restrictions before you start provisioning dedicated hosts.

```
az vm list-skus --location eastus --resource-type hostGroups/hosts -o table
```


Note

First, when using host group, the nodepool fault domain count is always the same as the host group fault domain count. In order to use cluster auto-scaling to work with ADH and AKS, please make sure your host group fault domain count and capacity is enough. Secondly, only change fault domain count from the default of 1 to any other number if you know what they are doing as a misconfiguration could lead to a unscalable configuration.

[Determine how many hosts you would need based on the expected VM Utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-host-general-purpose-skus).

Evaluate [host utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts-how-to#check-the-status-of-the-host) to determine the number of allocatable VMs by size before you deploy.

```
az vm host get-instance-view --resource-group myDHResourceGroup --host-group MyHostGroup --name MyHost
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Group to an AKS cluster

A host group is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it. When planning for high availability, there are more options. You can use one or both of the following options with your dedicated hosts:

- Span across multiple availability zones. In this case, you're required to have a host group in each of the zones you wish to use.
- Span across multiple fault domains, which are mapped to physical racks.

In either case, you need to provide the fault domain count for your host group. If you don't want to span fault domains in your group, use a fault domain count of 1.

You can also decide to use both availability zones and fault domains.

## Create a Host Group

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

For more information about the host SKUs and pricing, see [Azure Dedicated Host pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/).

Use az vm host create to create a host. If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll be asked to specify the fault domain for your host.

In this example, we'll use [az vm host group create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/host/group#az-vm-host-group-create) to create a host group using both availability zones and fault domains.

```
az vm host group create \
--name myHostGroup \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup \
--zone 1 \
--platform-fault-domain-count 1 \
--automatic-placement true
```


## Create a Dedicated Host

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll need to specify the fault domain for your host.

```
az vm host create \
--host-group myHostGroup \
--name myHost \
--sku DSv3-Type1 \
--platform-fault-domain 1 \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup
```


## Use a user-assigned Identity

Important

A user-assigned Identity with "contributor" role on the Resource Group of the Host Group is required.

First, create a Managed Identity

```
az identity create --resource-group <Resource Group> --name <Managed Identity name>
```


Assign Managed Identity

```
az role assignment create --assignee <id> --role "Contributor" --scope <Resource id>
```


## Create an AKS cluster using the Host Group

Create an AKS cluster, and add the Host Group you just configured.

```
az aks create \
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name MyManagedCluster \
--location eastus \
--nodepool-name agentpool1 \
--node-count 1 \
--host-group-id <id> \
--node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 \
--assign-identity <id> \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Node Pool to an existing AKS cluster

Add a Host Group to an already existing AKS cluster.

```
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup --node-count 1 --host-group-id <id> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3
```


## Remove a Dedicated Host Node Pool from an AKS cluster

```
az aks nodepool delete --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create an AKS cluster with a Dedicated host, and to add a dedicated host to an existing cluster. For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see [dedicated-hosts](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts).

# Set up the Azure Kubernetes Service communication manager

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) communication manager streamlines notifications for all your AKS maintenance tasks by using Azure Resource Notifications and Azure Resource Graph frameworks. The communication manager gives you timely alerts on event triggers and outcomes, so that you can closely monitor your upgrades.

If maintenance fails, the communication manager notifies you with the reasons for the failure. This information reduces operational hassles related to observability and follow-ups.

By following the steps in this article, you can set up notifications for all types of automatic upgrades that use maintenance windows.

## Prerequisites

Configure your cluster for either the

[automatic upgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster)or the[automatic upgrade channel for nodes](auto-upgrade-node-os-image).Create a

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)for your configuration of automatic upgrades.

## Set up the communication manager

In the Azure portal, go to the resource.

Select

**Monitoring**>**Alerts**>**Alert Rules**, and then select**Create**.On the

**Condition**tab, for**Signal name**, select**Custom log search**.In the

**Search query**box, paste one of the following custom queries. Be sure to update the`where id contains`

path to reference your resources for subscription ID, resource group name, and cluster name.The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for clusters:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "K8sVersionUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for NodeOS:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "NodeOSUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

Go to the

**Condition**tab. Configure the alert conditions with the following settings:**Measure**: Select**Table rows**.**Aggregation type**: Select**Count**.**Aggregation granularity**: Select**30 minutes**.**Threshold value**: Keep at**0**.**Split by dimensions**: For**Dimension name**, select**status**. Then select the**Include all future values**checkbox.

In the

**Split by dimensions**area, for**Dimension values**, select a value. Because you selected**status**for the dimension name, the available values are**Scheduled**,**Started**,**Completed**,**Canceled**, and**Failed**.Note

These status values appear only if your cluster previously executed automatic upgrade operations. For new clusters or for clusters that haven't undergone automatic upgrades yet, the dropdown list might appear empty or show no available dimensions. After your cluster performs its first automatic upgrade, these status values become available for selection.

Go to the

**Actions**tab. Make sure that an action group with the correct email address exists, so that you can receive the notifications:Select

**Use action groups**>**Create an action group**.For

**Notification type**, select**Email/SMS_message/Push/Voice**.Select the

**Email**checkbox, and then enter the email address in the**Email**box.

Go to the

**Details**tab. Assign a managed identity so that you can grant access to the necessary resources. In the**Identity**area, select**System assigned managed identity**.Go to the

**Review + create**tab, and then select**Create**.Now that you've created the alert rule, you can assign the appropriate roles for the managed identity:

- In the alert rule, go to
**Settings**>**Identity**>**System assigned managed identity**>**Azure role assignments**. - Select
**Add role assignment**, select the**Reader**role, and assign it to the resource group. - Select
**Add role assignment**again, select the**Reader**role, and assign it to the subscription.

Tip

If you don't see the

**Identity**option, make sure that you created your alert rule and that you have the necessary permissions.- In the alert rule, go to

After you set up the communication manager, it sends advance notices one week before maintenance starts and one day before maintenance starts. It also sends you timely alerts during the maintenance operation.

## Verify the configuration

To upgrade the cluster, wait for the automatic upgrader to start. Then verify that you promptly receive notices on the email address that you configured to receive notices.

Check the Azure Resource Graph database for the scheduled notification record. Each scheduled event notification should be listed as one record in the `ContainerServiceEventResources`

table.

# Pod Sandboxing considerations

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

For Pod Sandboxing deployments on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) there are several items to consider in regard to resource management, memory management, CPU management, and security.

## Resource management

Memory and CPU management behavior with Pod Sandboxing might be unfamiliar to some users. These considerations are relevant when specifying resources in a deployment, especially for larger and resource sensitive workloads.

### Kata components

In a Kata deployment, there are generally two families of components that get deployed. You have **host components** and **guest components**.

- The main
**host components**comprise of the*Kata shim*,*Cloud Hypervisor*, and*virtiofsd*.- The
*Kata shim*manages a pod VM lifecycle. *Cloud Hypervisor*is the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) used by the Kata shim.*virtiofsd*is a daemon used to share files between each Pod VM and its container host.

- The
- The main
**guest components**include the*user's workloads*,*pod VM kernel*, and the*Kata agent*.- The
*Kata agent*manages containers inside of the Pod VMs

- The

### Memory management

With Kata pods, you have the ability to specify the amount of memory of the Pod VM that hosts your workloads. It's crucial that you configure the values accordingly so that a pod has sufficient resources, but doesn't result in unused memory being allocated to the pod.

### Pod VM memory size

There's an amount of memory allocated to each pod VM that runs a container. This VM memory size is inclusive of all the memory necessary to run Kata guest components. Users should take care to ensure that they buffer some extra memory beyond the expected consumption of their workloads to account for the consumption of other guest components, such as the kata agent or VM kernel. Examples are given on typical memory values later on in this article.

The pod VM memory size is equivalent to the [Kubernetes pod memory limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-and-a-memory-limit) the user specifies. A user can change the value by changing their pod memory limit; if no values are specified, a default size of 512Mi is applied. Once the pod starts, this size becomes fixed.

As the pod VM memory size increases, the runtime class memory overhead should be expected to increase alongside it.

### Runtime class memory overhead

Pod Sandboxing workloads come with a default kata runtime class (`kata-vm-isolation`

) which comes with default overheads for resources. Users that want finer grain control of their resource quotas can [set up a custom runtime class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/#setup) with specific resource overheads. When doing so, users should ensure that the memory overhead value of the runtime class is enough that covers all expected usage for the **host components** of a kata deployment. The runtime class memory overhead does *not* need to account for the expected memory consumption of the **guest components**.

You can create a specialized runtime and specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RuntimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example), let's assume I want to create a runtime for workloads I expect to be smaller in consumption:

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: small-kata-pods
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
memory: "120Mi"
```


Specifying overheads isn't required, and suggested if you want finer control over the resources being set aside for your workloads. If you use the default `kata-vm-isolation`

runtime class and don't specify any overheads in your YAML, the overhead of the Pod VM size defaults to 512Mi and the runtime class overhead defaults to 600Mi. This default runtime overhead is calculated with the default pod VM size (512Mi) plus to approximate memory needed by host components for such a VM size (~88Mi).

### User workloads

When a user deploys a Kata workload, they're able to use memory up to the configured *pod VM memory size* minus the other guest components, such as the Kata agent or the guest VM kernel.

If you would like to get an approximation of the memory used by these components:

- Connect to the pod VM (either via
`kubectl exec`

or`kubectl debug`

to open a shell inside your pod). - Run the
`free`

command. - Inspect the "used" column in the output to get an idea of the memory consumed by the guest kernel/kata agent.

### Memory cgroups

When a Kata pod is scheduled to run, kubelet assigns the pod to a memory `cgroup`

. This `cgroup`

enforces the pod's memory limits/requests, allowing a user to define the resource quotas available to a pod.

Within the memory `cgroup`

, there are two important fields to consider:

`memory.current`

defines how many bytes of memory the host components and the pod VM memory size allocates.`memory.max`

optional, user defined upper limit of memory.current for pods where users want to impose a memory limit.- The kubelet computes this value as the sum of a pod's memory limit and its runtime class memory overhead.


At any point, if the `memory.current`

value exceeds that of `memory.max`

, [the kernel might trigger an OOMKill on the pod if memory pressure is detected](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

### Reference usage values

Users can utilize these values to serve as a reference for the typical memory usage and values across the different variables covered. Pod VM memory sizes under 128Mi aren't supported.

| Pod VM Memory Size | Runtime class overhead | memory.current | memory.max | Free memory available to Host components |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128Mi | 16Mi | 133Mi | 144Mi | 11Mi |
| 256Mi | 32Mi | 263Mi | 288Mi | 25Mi |
| 1Gi | 128Mi | 1034Mi | 1152Mi | 118Mi |
| 2Gi | 256Mi | 2063Mi | 2304Mi | 241Mi |
| 4Gi | 374Mi | 4122Mi | 4470Mi | 348Mi |
| 8Gi | 512Mi | 8232Mi | 8704Mi | 472Mi |
| 32Gi | 640Mi | 32918Mi | 33408Mi | 490Mi |
| 64Gi | 768Mi | 65825Mi | 66304Mi | 479Mi |
| 96Gi | 896Mi | 98738Mi | 99200Mi | 462Mi |
| 128Gi | 1Gi | 131646Mi | 132096Mi | 450Mi |

## CPU management

In a similar vein to memory, you can also allocate CPU resources to your Kata workloads. Doing so is recommended; without declaring a CPU limit for your Kata pod, Kata host components are able to use any CPU capacity available on the node.

### Reserving CPU

When reserving CPUs for your Kata workloads, you have two fields you can choose to set.

- The
*runtime class CPU overhead* - The
*pod CPU limit*

When at least one of the two values is specified, the control plane reserves the specified number of CPUs on the node for your workload. Other pods on the same node can't access this reserved capacity.

### Pod CPU limit

You can declare your [pod CPU limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/) in your application's manifest. A specified pod CPU limit defines the limit of the CPUs that containers in the associated pod VM can use.

If you specify fractions of CPUs for the pod CPU limit, those fractions will get rounded up to the next integer. The rounded up number becomes the number of vCPUs allocated to the Pod VM, but a `cgroup`

will limit the workload to only consume the fraction specified in the pod CPU limit.

If no number is declared, one vCPU will be allocated to the pod VM if the capacity is available on the node. There's no limit on the CPU consumption of the Kata host components.

### Runtime class CPU overhead

The runtime class overhead should be specified if you'd like to preemptively reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components.

You can specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RunTimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example):

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: custom-kata-runtime
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
cpu: "250m"
```


### Best practices

#### Memory management

- Ensure you specify pod VM memory sizes (defined by the
`limits.memory`

in your manifest) and suitable resource quotas for all your deployments.- Ensure you use a nonzero
*pod request*if you want to ensure that some node capacity is reserved for the pod VM before that VM starts up. The request should account for the pod VM and containers that are expected to run on it. - Ensure you use a nonzero
*runtime class overhead*if you want to reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components before those components start up.

- Ensure you use a nonzero
- If you expect your pod workloads to be especially resource hungry, you can specify limits accordingly for the pod VM to ensure that there are ample resources available for your workloads.
- Declare a suitable runtime class memory overhead such that it gives enough memory for your host components but doesn't take too much to avoid allocating unused memory.

#### CPU management

If your node typically has plenty of free CPU capacity, these reservations might be unnecessary.

If your nodes typically run to the limit with CPU consumption, then a nonzero reservation ensures your pods can be executed more reliably.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
*not*available to other workloads on the node.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
Make sure you specify CPU requests that your infrastructure can accommodate. If your available capacity runs near 0, or your request is too large, your workloads might

[fail to start](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-that-is-too-big-for-your-nodes)Align your CPU requests with your CPU limits. The Kata shim doesn't have visibility into requests. Therefore, if no CPU limit is declared, the pod VM is limited to one vCPU. The Kata host components, which do have visibility into request values, consumes the rest of the requested CPU count and have no limit to CPU consumption.

Reserved capacity for a specific workload is

*not*available to other workloads on the node.

### Example declarations

| Runtime class CPU overhead | Pod CPU Request/Limit | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | The control plane reserves two CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets one CPU, and containers on the pod can use up to the one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to two CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| 1 | 2.5 | The control plane reserves 3.5 CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets three vCPUs, but containers on the pod VM can use up to 2.5 vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to 3.5 CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| None | 1 | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and the pod VM together are allowed to use up to one CPU from the reserved capacity on the node. One CPU is always available to the pod VM due to the CPU request. |
| 1 | None | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The kata host components and the pod VM can use any CPU capacity available on the node. At least one CPU is always available due to the overhead reservation. |

## Security

Pod Sandboxing offers users a compelling option to isolate their workloads from other workloads and the host. There are, nonetheless, important security concerns that should be taken into account.

### Privileged pods

There are scenarios in which privileged pods might be required. Users are able to spin up privileged pods, but no [host devices are attached to the pod](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/privileged.md#containerd).

Using privileged containers lead to root access in the guest VM, but remain isolated from the host.

Privileged pods, even on Pod Sandboxing, should only be used when necessary. Privileged pods should continue to be [managed by trusted users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#privileged).

### Host path storage volumes

`hostPath`

volumes can be mounted into Kata pods. In Pod Sandboxing, using `hostPath`

volumes can potentially undermine the isolation that Kata provides; since part of the host filesystem is exposed directly to the container, a potential attack vector is opened. The warnings posed by [upstream](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) should be considered as relevant for Pod Sandboxing as well.

There are some exceptions; files under `/dev`

are mounted into the container from the guest system instead of the host system. This helps maintain pod isolation for situations where this path must be mounted to function.

Warning

Unless necessary, the recommendation is to *avoid* using hostPath storage volumes.

#### Blocking hostPath via Azure Policy

[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) allows users to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on their cluster components in a centralized, consistent manner.

There is a set of [built-in policy sets](policy-reference) for AKS that enforce best practices. Users can take advantage of one of these policies to block deployments that attempt to mount hostPaths.

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service control plane metrics (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to monitor the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane by using control plane metrics in Azure Monitor.

AKS supports a subset of control plane metrics free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks#aks-monitoring-data-metrics-logs-integrations). The control plane metrics feature gives you visibility into the availability and performance of critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, the scheduler, the autoscaler, and the controller manager in AKS. The feature is also fully compatible with the managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana. You can use these metrics to maximize overall observability and to maintain operational excellence for your AKS cluster.

## Control plane platform metrics

AKS offers some free control plane metrics for monitoring the API server and etcd. These metrics are automatically collected for all AKS clusters at no cost. You can analyze the metrics by using the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) in the Azure portal. You can also create metrics-based alerts by using the metrics data.

To see the full list of supported control plane platform metrics, see the [AKS monitoring reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

## Prerequisites and limitations

- The control plane metrics (preview) feature supports only the
[managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)in Azure Monitor. [Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/private-link-security)isn't supported.- You can customize only the default
configmap file. No other customization is supported.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

- Your AKS cluster must use
[managed identity authentication](use-managed-identity).

### Install the aks-preview extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install or update the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension by using theor`az extension add`

command:`az extension update`

`# Install the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview feature flag

Register the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag by using thecommand:`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show as

**Registered**.Verify the registration status by using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

When the status is

**Registered**, refresh the registration of the Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider by using thecommand:`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"`


## Enable control plane metrics on an AKS cluster

Enable control plane metrics by using the managed service for Prometheus add-on when you create a new cluster or update an existing cluster.

Note

Unlike the metrics that are collected from cluster nodes, control plane metrics are collected by a component that isn't part of the `ama-metrics`

add-on. Enabling the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag and the managed service for Prometheus add-on ensures that control plane metrics are collected. After you enable metrics collection, it can take several minutes for the data to appear in the workspace.

### New AKS cluster

To learn how to collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from your AKS cluster, see [Enable Prometheus and Grafana for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana). For an AKS cluster, complete the steps described on the **CLI** tab.

### Existing AKS cluster

If your cluster already has the managed service for Prometheus add-on, update the cluster to ensure that it collects control plane metrics by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command:

```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Query control plane metrics

Control plane metrics are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace in the cluster's region. You can query the metrics directly in the workspace or by using the Azure Managed Grafana instance that's connected to the workspace.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your AKS cluster resource.On the left menu, select

**Monitor**>**Monitor Settings**.Go to the Azure Monitor workspace that is linked to the cluster.

In the Azure Monitor workspace, under

**Managed Prometheus**, query the metrics by using the Prometheus explorer.

Note

AKS provides dashboard templates to help you view and analyze your control plane telemetry data in real time. If you use Azure Managed Grafana to visualize the data, you can import the following dashboards:

## Customize control plane metrics

AKS includes a preconfigured set of metrics to collect and store for each component. Metrics for the API server and etcd are collected by default. You can customize the list of metrics that are collected by modifying the [ ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) configmap file.

Default targets include the following values:

```
controlplane-apiserver = true
controlplane-cluster-autoscaler = false
controlplace-node-auto-provisioning = false
controlplane-kube-scheduler = false
controlplane-kube-controller-manager = false
controlplane-etcd = true
```


All configmap files should be applied to the `kube-system`

namespace for any cluster.

### Customize an ingestion profile

You can customize an ingestion file for collected metrics. For more information, see [Minimal ingestion profile for control plane metrics in managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration-minimal#minimal-ingestion-for-default-on-targets).

#### Ingest only minimal metrics from default targets

- Set
`default-targets-metrics-keep-list.minimalIngestionProfile`

to`true`

, so it ingests only the minimal set of metrics for each of the default targets:`controlplane-apiserver`

and`controlplane-etcd`

.

#### Ingest all metrics from all targets

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`false`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplace-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Apply the configmap file by using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest more than minimal metrics

Using the `minimalingestionprofile`

setting helps reduce the ingestion volume of metrics. If set to `true`

, only default recording rules, default alerts, and metrics that appear in the default dashboards are collected.

## Troubleshoot control plane metrics issues

Make sure that the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag is enabled and that the `ama-metrics`

pods are running.

Note

The [troubleshooting methods](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot) for the managed service for Prometheus don't apply directly in this scenario. The components that scrape the control plane aren't included in the managed service for Prometheus add-on.

**Configmap file formatting**: Make sure that you use the correct formatting in the configmap file. Verify that the fields`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

,`minimal-ingestion-profile`

, and`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

and other fields are correctly populated with their intended values.**Isolate the control plane from the data plane**: Start by setting some of the[node-related metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default)to`true`

, and then verify that the metrics are forwarded to the workspace. Completing these steps helps you determine whether an issue is specific to scraping control plane metrics.**A change in the number of events ingested**: After you apply the changes, you can open the metrics explorer in the Azure portal. Go to the Azure Monitor overview pane for the cluster or go to the**Monitoring**section of the selected cluster. Check for an increase or a decrease in the number of events ingested per minute. This information can help you determine whether a specific metric is missing or if all metrics are missing.**A specific metric isn't exposed**: In some scenarios, a metric is documented, but it isn't exposed from the target and isn't forwarded to the Azure Monitor workspace. In this case, it's necessary to verify that other metrics are forwarded to the workspace.Note

If you want to collect the

`apiserver_request_duration_seconds`

metric or another bucket metric, you must set the entire series in the histogram family:`controlplane-apiserver = "apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count"`

**No access to the Azure Monitor workspace**: When you enable the add-on, you might specify an existing workspace that you can't access. In that scenario, it appears that metrics aren't collected and forwarded. Make sure that you create a new workspace to use to collect metrics when you enable the add-on or when you create the cluster.

## Disable control plane metrics on your AKS cluster

You can disable control plane metrics at any time by disabling the managed service for Prometheus add-on and unregistering the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag.

Remove the metrics add-on that scrapes Prometheus metrics by using the

command:`az aks update`

`az aks update --disable-azure-monitor-metrics --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

To disable scraping control plane metrics on the AKS cluster, unregister the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag via thecommand:`az feature unregister`

`az feature unregister "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`


## Frequently asked questions

### Can I scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus?

No. Currently, you can't scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus. Self-hosted Prometheus can scrape only a single instance, depending on the load balancer, so the metrics aren't reliable. Often, multiple replicas of the control plane metrics are visible only through the managed service for Prometheus.

### Why isn't the user agent available in the control plane metrics?

In AKS, [control plane metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/) don't have the user agent. The user agent is available only through the control plane logs that you access in [diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you provide network connectivity for your nodes and applications. These network resources include IP address ranges, load balancers, and ingress controllers.

This best practices article focuses on network connectivity and security for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Explain Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) network mode in AKS.
- Plan for required IP addressing and connectivity.
- Distribute traffic using load balancers, ingress controllers, or a web application firewall (WAF).
- Securely connect to cluster nodes.

## Choose the appropriate network model


Best practice guidanceUse Azure CNI networking in AKS for integration with existing virtual networks or on-premises networks. This network model allows greater separation of resources and controls in an enterprise environment.


Virtual networks provide the basic connectivity for AKS nodes and customers to access your applications. There are two different ways to deploy AKS clusters into virtual networks:

**Azure CNI networking**: Deploys into a virtual network and uses the[Azure CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md)Kubernetes plugin. Pods receive individual IPs that can route to other network services or on-premises resources.

Azure CNI is a valid option for production deployments.

### CNI Networking

Azure CNI is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. It assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network. There's no need for extra routing to communicate with other resources or services.

Notably, Azure CNI networking for production allows for separation of control and management of resources. From a security perspective, you often want different teams to manage and secure those resources. With Azure CNI networking, you connect to existing Azure resources, on-premises resources, or other services directly via IP addresses assigned to each pod.

When you use Azure CNI networking, the virtual network resource is in a separate resource group to the AKS cluster. Delegate permissions for the AKS cluster identity to access and manage these resources. The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network.

If you wish to define a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


By default, AKS uses a managed identity for its cluster identity. However, you can use a service principal instead.

- For more information about AKS service principal delegation, see
[Delegate access to other Azure resources](kubernetes-service-principal#delegate-access-to-other-azure-resources). - For more information about managed identities, see
[Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

As each node and pod receives its own IP address, plan out the address ranges for the AKS subnets. Keep the following criteria in mind:

- The subnet must be large enough to provide IP addresses for every node, pod, and network resource you deploy.
- With Azure CNI networking, each running node has default limits to the number of pods.

- Avoid using IP address ranges that overlap with existing network resources.
- It's necessary to allow connectivity to on-premises or peered networks in Azure.

- To handle scale-out events or cluster upgrades, you need extra IP addresses available in the assigned subnet.
- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see
[Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see

To calculate the IP address required, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

When creating a cluster with Azure CNI networking, you specify other address ranges for the cluster, such as the Docker bridge address, DNS service IP, and service address range. In general, make sure these address ranges don't overlap each other or any networks associated with the cluster, including any virtual networks, subnets, on-premises and peered networks.

For the specific details around limits and sizing for these address ranges, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

## Distribute ingress traffic


Best practice guidanceTo distribute HTTP or HTTPS traffic to your applications, use ingress resources and controllers. Compared to an Azure load balancer, ingress controllers provide extra features and can be managed as native Kubernetes resources.


While an Azure load balancer can distribute customer traffic to applications in your AKS cluster, it's limited in understanding that traffic. A load balancer resource works at *layer 4* and distributes traffic based on protocol or ports.

Most web applications using HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at *layer 7*. Ingress can distribute traffic based on the URL of the application and handle TLS/SSL termination. Ingress also reduces the number of IP addresses you expose and map.

With a load balancer, each application typically needs a public IP address assigned and mapped to the service in the AKS cluster. With an ingress resource, a single IP address can distribute traffic to multiple applications.

There are two components for ingress:

- An ingress
*resource* - An ingress
*controller*

### Ingress resource

The *ingress resource* is a YAML manifest of `kind: Ingress`

. It defines the host, certificates, and rules to route traffic to services running in your AKS cluster.

The following example YAML manifest distributes traffic for *myapp.com* to one of two services, *blogservice* or *storeservice*, and directs the customer to one service or the other based on the URL they access.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: myapp-ingress
spec:
ingressClassName: PublicIngress
tls:
- hosts:
- myapp.com
secretName: myapp-secret
rules:
- host: myapp.com
http:
paths:
- path: /blog
backend:
service:
name: blogservice
port: 80
- path: /store
backend:
service:
name: storeservice
port: 80
```


### Ingress controller

An *ingress controller* is a daemon that runs on an AKS node and watches for incoming requests. Traffic is then distributed based on the rules defined in the ingress resource. While the most common ingress controller is based on [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/kubernetes-ingress-controller), AKS doesn't restrict you to a specific controller. You can use [Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview), [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour), [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org), [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik), etc.

Ingress controllers must be scheduled on a Linux node. Indicate that the resource should run on a Linux-based node using a node selector in your YAML manifest or Helm chart deployment. For more information, see [Use node selectors to control where pods are scheduled in AKS](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-selectors).

## Ingress with the application routing addon

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed, ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing add-on, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Secure traffic with a web application firewall (WAF)


Best practice guidanceTo scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as

[Barracuda WAF for Azure]or[Azure Application Gateway for Containers]. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic TLS termination.

Typically, an ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource in your AKS cluster that distributes traffic to services and applications. The controller runs as a daemon on an AKS node, and consumes some of the node's resources, like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In larger environments, you may want to consider the following:

- Offload some of this traffic routing or TLS termination to a network resource outside of the AKS cluster.
- Scan incoming traffic for potential attacks.

For that extra layer of security, a web application firewall (WAF) filters the incoming traffic. With a set of rules, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) watches for attacks like cross-site scripting or cookie poisoning. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) is a WAF that integrates with AKS clusters, locking in these security features before the traffic reaches your AKS cluster and applications.

Since other third-party solutions also perform these functions, you can continue to use existing investments or expertise in your preferred product.

Load balancer or ingress resources continually run in your AKS cluster and refine the traffic distribution. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) can be centrally managed as an ingress controller with a resource definition. To get started, [create an Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller).

## Control traffic flow with network policies


Best practice guidanceUse network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication.


Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. Network policies are a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

To use [network policies in AKS](use-network-policies), the feature can be enabled either during cluster creation or on an existing AKS cluster. If you are planning to use network policies, ensure the feature is enabled on your AKS cluster.

Note

Network policies could be used for Linux-based or Windows-based nodes and pods in AKS.

You create a network policy as a Kubernetes resource using a YAML manifest. Policies are applied to defined pods, with ingress or egress rules defining traffic flow.

The following example applies a network policy to pods with the *app: backend* label applied to them. The ingress rule only allows traffic from pods with the *app: frontend* label.

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: backend-policy
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ingress:
- from:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
```


To get started with policies, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-network-policies).

## Securely connect to nodes through a bastion host


Best practice guidanceDon't expose remote connectivity to your AKS nodes. Create a bastion host, or jump box, in a management virtual network. Use the bastion host to securely route traffic into your AKS cluster to remote management tasks.


You can complete most operations in AKS using the Azure management tools or through the Kubernetes API server. AKS nodes are only available on a private network and aren't connected to the public internet. To connect to nodes and provide maintenance and support, route your connections through a bastion host, or jump box. Verify this host lives in a separate, securely peered management virtual network to the AKS cluster virtual network.

You should also secure the management network for the bastion host. Use an [Azure ExpressRoute](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN gateway](/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) to connect to an on-premises network and control access using network security groups.
