Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to plan, execute, and validate the migration from Network Policy Manager (NPM) to Cilium Network Policy. The goal is to ensure policy parity, minimize service disruption, and align with Azure CNI's strategic direction toward eBPF-based networking and enhanced observability.

Important

This guide applies exclusively to AKS clusters running Linux nodes. Cilium Network Policy isn't currently supported for Windows nodes in AKS.

## Key considerations before you begin

- Policy Compatibility: NPM and Cilium differ in enforcement models. Before migration you need to validate that existing policies are compatible or identify required changes. Refer to the Pre-Migration Validation section for guidance.
- Downtime Expectations: Policy enforcement might be temporarily inconsistent during node reimaging.
- Windows Node Pools: Cilium Network Policy isn't currently supported for Windows nodes in AKS.

## Pre-migration validation

Before migrating from Network Policy Manager (NPM) to Cilium Network Policy, it's important to assess the compatibility of your existing network policies. While most policies continue to function as expected post-migration, there are specific scenarios where behavior might differ between NPM and Cilium. These differences could require updates to your policies either before or after the migration to ensure consistent enforcement and avoid unintended traffic drops. In this section, we outline known scenarios where policy adjustments might be necessary. We explain why it matters, and provide guidance on what actions—if any—are required to make your policies Cilium-compatible.

### NetworkPolicy with endPort

Note

Cilium started supporting the `endPort`

field in Kubernetes NetworkPolicy in version 1.17.

The endPort field allows you to define a range of ports in a single rule, rather than specifying individual ports.

Here's an example of a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy that uses the endPort field:

```
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 32000
endPort: 32768
```


**Action Required:**

- If your AKS cluster is running Cilium version 1.17 or later, no changes are needed as endPort is fully supported.
- If your cluster is running a Cilium version earlier than 1.17, remove the endPort field from any policies before migrating. Use explicit single-port entries instead.

### NetworkPolicy with ipBlock

The ipBlock field in Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allows you to define CIDR ranges for ingress sources or egress destinations. These ranges can include external IPs, Pod IPs, or Node IPs. However, Cilium doesn't allow egress to Pod or Node IPs using ipBlock, even if those IPs fall within the specified CIDR range.

For example, the following NetworkPolicy uses an ipBlock to allow all egress traffic to 0.0.0.0/0:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: example-ipblock
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
```


- Under NPM, this policy would allow egress to all destinations, including Pods and Nodes.
- After migrating to Cilium, egress to Pod and Node IPs will be blocked, even though they fall within the 0.0.0.0/0 range.

**Action Required:**

- To allow traffic to Pod IPs, before migration replace the ipBlock with a combination of namespaceSelector and podSelector.

Here's an example of using namespaceSelector and podSelector:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: example-ipblock
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
- namespaceSelector: {}
- podSelector: {}
```


- For Node IPs, there's no pre-migration workaround. After migration, you must create a CiliumNetworkPolicy that explicitly allows egress to the host and/or remote-node entities. Until this policy is in place, egress traffic to Node IPs is blocked.

Here's an example of CiliumNetworkPolicy to allow traffic from/to local and remote nodes:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-node-egress
namespace: ipblock-test
spec:
endpointSelector: {} # Applies to all pods in the namespace
egress:
- toEntities:
- host # host allows traffic from/to the local node's host network namespace
- remote-node # remote-node allows traffic from/to the remote node's host network namespace
```


### NetworkPolicy with named Ports

Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allows you to reference ports by name instead of number. If you're using named ports in your NetworkPolicies, Cilium might fail to enforce rules correctly and lead to unexpected traffic being blocked. This issue happens when the same port name is used for different ports.
For more information, see [Cilium GitHub issue #30003](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/30003).

Here's an example of NetworkPolicy uses Named port to allow egress traffic:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
annotations:
name: allow-egress
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
network-rules-egress: cilium-np-test
egress:
- ports:
- port: http-test # Named port
protocol: TCP
policyTypes:
- Egress
```


**Action Required:**

- Before migration, replace all named ports in your policies with their corresponding numeric values.

### NetworkPolicy with Egress Policies

Kubernetes NetworkPolicy on NPM doesn't block egress traffic from a pod to its own node's IP, this traffic is implicitly allowed. After you migrate to Cilium, this behavior will change, and traffic to local nodes that was previously allowed will be blocked unless explicitly allowed.

For example, the following policy allows egress only to an internal API subnet:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-egress
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 10.20.30.0/24
```


- With NPM: Egress traffic to 10.20.30.0/24 is allowed explicitly, and egress traffic to the local node is allowed implicitly.
- With Cilium: Only traffic to 10.20.30.0/24 is allowed; egress to the node IP is blocked unless you permit it explicitly.

**Action Required:**

- Review all existing egress policies for your workloads.
- If your applications rely on NPM's implicit allow behavior for egress to the local node, you must add explicit egress rules to maintain connectivity after migration.
- You can add a CiliumNetworkPolicy after migration to explicitly allow egress traffic to the local host.

### Ingress policy behavior changes

Under Network Policy Manager (NPM), ingress traffic arriving via a LoadBalancer or NodePort service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster" - which is the default setting - isn't subject to ingress policy enforcement. This behavior means that even if a pod has a restrictive ingress policy, traffic from external sources might still reach it via loadbalancer or nodeport services.

In contrast, Cilium enforces ingress policies on all traffic, including traffic routed internally due to externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster. As a result, after migration, traffic that was previously allowed might be dropped if the appropriate ingress rules aren't explicitly defined.

For example, Customer creates a network policy to deny all in ingress traffic

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
```


- With NPM: Direct connection to the pod or via ClusterIP service is blocked. However, access through NodePort or LoadBalancer is still allowed despite the deny-all policy.
- With Cilium: All ingress traffic is blocked, including traffic via NodePort or LoadBalancer, unless explicitly allowed.

**Action Required:**

- Review all ingress policies for workloads behind LoadBalancer or NodePort services using externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster.
- Ensure that ingress rules explicitly allow traffic from the expected external sources (for example, IP ranges, namespaces, or labels).
- If your policy currently relies on the implicit allow behavior under NPM, you must add explicit ingress rules to maintain connectivity after migration.

## Upgrade to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

To use Cilium Network Policy, your AKS cluster must be running Azure CNI powered by Cilium. When you enable Cilium in a cluster currently using NPM, the existing NPM engine is automatically uninstalled and replaced with Cilium.

Warning

The upgrade process triggers each node pool to be reimaged simultaneously. Upgrading each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image upgrade or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium will begin enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

Important

These instructions apply to clusters upgrading from Azure CNI to Azure CNI with the Cilium dataplane. Upgrades from bring-your-own CNIs or changes the IPAM mode aren't covered here. For more information, see [Upgrade Azure CNI documentation](update-azure-cni).

To perform the upgrade, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Use the following command to upgrade an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium. Replace the values for `clusterName`

and `resourceGroupName`

:

```
az aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --network-dataplane cilium
```

# Core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes core concepts of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and operate containerized applications at scale on Azure.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## What is AKS?

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications that use Kubernetes. For more information, see [What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?](what-is-aks).

## Cluster components

An AKS cluster is divided into two main components:

**Control plane**: The control plane provides the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.**Nodes**: Nodes are the underlying virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

Note

AKS managed components have the label `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby`

: `aks`

.

AKS manages the Helm releases with the prefix `aks-managed`

. Continuously increasing revisions on these releases are expected and safe.

### Control plane

The Azure managed control plane is composed of several components that help manage the cluster:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kube-apiserver` |
The API server (
|

`etcd`

[etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd)helps to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.`kube-scheduler`

[kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)) helps to make scheduling decisions. It watches for new pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.`kube-controller-manager`

[kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)) runs controller processes, such as noticing and responding when nodes go down.`cloud-controller-manager`

[cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager)) embeds cloud-specific control logic to run controllers specific to the cloud provider.### Nodes

Each AKS cluster has at least one node, which is an Azure VM that runs Kubernetes node components. The following components run on each node:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kubelet` |
The
|

`kube-proxy`

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)is a network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes.`container runtime`

[container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime)manages the execution and lifecycle of containers.## Node configuration

Configure the following settings for nodes.

### VM size and image

The *Azure VM size* for your nodes defines CPUs, memory, size, and the storage type available, such as a high-performance solid-state drive or a regular hard-disk drive. The VM size you choose depends on the workload requirements and the number of pods that you plan to run on each node. As of May 2025, the default VM SKU and size will be dynamically selected by AKS based on available capacity and quota if the parameter is left blank during deployment. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes).

In AKS, the *VM image* for your cluster's nodes is based on Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), or Windows Server 2022. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform automatically creates and configures the requested number of VMs. Agent nodes are billed as standard VMs. Any VM size discounts, including [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations), are automatically applied.

### OS disks

Default OS disk sizing is used on new clusters or node pools only when a default OS disk size isn't specified. This behavior applies to both managed and ephemeral OS disks. For more information, see [Default OS disk sizing](concepts-storage#default-os-disk-sizing).

### Resource reservations

AKS uses node resources to help the nodes function as part of the cluster. This usage can cause a discrepancy between the node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS. To maintain node performance and functionality, AKS reserves two types of resources, CPU and memory, on each node. For more information, see [Resource reservations in AKS](node-resource-reservations).

### OS

AKS supports two linux distros: Ubuntu and Azure Linux. Ubuntu is the default Linux distro on AKS. Windows node pools are also supported on AKS with the [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/en-us/windows-server/get-started/servicing-channels-comparison) as the default channel on AKS. For more information on default OS versions, see documentation on [node images](node-images).

### Container runtime

A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. The runtime helps abstract away system calls or OS-specific functionality to run containers on Linux or Windows. For Linux node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is used on Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher. For Windows Server 2019 and 2022 node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is generally available and is the only runtime option on Kubernetes version 1.23 and higher.

## Pods

A *pod* is a group of one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, but you can run multiple containers in a pod.

## Node pools

In AKS, nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. These node pools contain the underlying virtual machine scale sets and virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

When you create an AKS cluster, you define the initial number of nodes and their size (version), which creates a [system node pool](use-system-pools). System node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting critical system pods, such as CoreDNS and `konnectivity`

.

To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, you can create *user node pools*. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods.

For more information, see [Create node pools in AKS](create-node-pools) and [Manage node pools in AKS](manage-node-pools).

## Node resource group

When you create an AKS cluster in an Azure resource group, the AKS resource provider automatically creates a second resource group called the *node resource group*. This resource group contains all the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster, including VMs, virtual machine scale sets, and storage.

For more information, see the following resources:

[Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](faq)[Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?](faq)[Can I modify tags and other properties of the resources in the AKS node resource group?](faq)

## Namespaces

Kubernetes resources, such as pods and deployments, are logically grouped into *namespaces* to divide an AKS cluster and create, view, or manage access to resources.

The following namespaces are created by default in an AKS cluster:

| Namespace | Description |
|---|---|
`default` |
The
|

`kube-node-lease`

[kube-node-lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace enables nodes to communicate their availability to the control plane.`kube-public`

[kube-public](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace isn't typically used, but you can use it so that resources are visible across the whole cluster by any user.`kube-system`

[kube-system](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace is used by Kubernetes to manage cluster resources, such as`coredns`

, `konnectivity-agent`

, and `metrics-server`

. It is not recommended to deploy your own applications to this namespace. For rare cases where deploying your own applications to this namespace is necessary, see the [FAQ](faq#can-admission-controller-webhooks-affect-kube-system-and-internal-aks-namespaces-)to learn how.## Cluster modes

In AKS, you can create a cluster with the Automatic or Standard mode. AKS Automatic provides a more fully managed experience. You can manage cluster configuration, including nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings. AKS Standard provides more control over the cluster configuration, including the ability to manage node pools, scaling, and other settings.

For more information, see [AKS Automatic and Standard feature comparison](intro-aks-automatic#aks-automatic-and-standard-feature-comparison).

## Pricing tiers

AKS offers three pricing tiers for cluster management: Free, Standard, and Premium. The pricing tier you choose determines the features that are available for managing your cluster.

For more information, see [Pricing tiers for AKS cluster management](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

## Supported Kubernetes versions

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions in AKS](supported-kubernetes-versions).
