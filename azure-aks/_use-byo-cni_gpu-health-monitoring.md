Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes doesn't provide a network interface system by default. Instead, [network plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) provide this functionality. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides several supported Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. For information on supported plugins, see [Networking concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-network).

The supported plugins meet most networking needs in Kubernetes. However, advanced AKS users might want the same CNI plugin that they used in on-premises Kubernetes environments. Or these users might want to use advanced functionalities available in other CNI plugins.

This article shows how to deploy an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled. From there, you can install any CNI plugin that works in Azure.

## Support

Microsoft support can't assist with CNI-related issues in clusters that you deploy by bringing your own CNI plugin. For example, CNI-related issues would cover most east/west (pod to pod) traffic, along with `kubectl proxy`

and similar commands. If you want CNI-related support, use a supported AKS network plugin or seek support from the CNI plugin vendor.

Microsoft still provides support for issues that aren't related to CNI.

## Prerequisites

- For Azure Resource Manager or Bicep, use at least template version 2022-01-02-preview or 2022-06-01.
- For the Azure CLI, use at least version 2.39.0.
- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the address range for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual network. - The cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet or modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node's Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups). - AKS doesn't create a route table in the managed virtual network.
- You must specify a Pod CIDR (IP address range for pods). The AKS control plane uses this range for internal traffic routing to pods, even though pod IP assignment will be managed by your custom CNI. If no pod CIDR is provided, control plane to pod communication may fail or be misrouted. You must select a pod CIDR that does not conflict with any other network in your environment and avoids Azure reserved ranges, such as,
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

. For example, you might use a range such as`10.XX.0.0/16`

that is unique to your cluster. This ensures that the control plane can route directly to pod IPs on your nodes, and no IP overlap will occur if you integrate with other networks or clusters.

## Create an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled

Create an Azure resource group for your AKS cluster by using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location eastus --name myResourceGroup`

Create an AKS cluster by using the

command. Pass the`az aks create`

`--network-plugin`

parameter with the parameter value of`none`

.`az aks create \ --location eastus \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --network-plugin none \ --pod-cidr "10.10.0.0/16" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Deploy a CNI plugin

After AKS provisioning finishes, the cluster is online. But all the nodes are in a `NotReady`

state, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 NotReady agent 6m9s v1.21.9
$ kubectl get node -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].message'
NAME STATUS
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```


At this point, the cluster is ready for installation of a CNI plugin.

# GPU health monitoring in Node Problem Detector (NPD) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes

This article describes how Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses Node Problem Detector (NPD) to monitor the health of GPU-enabled node pools. NPD is a Kubernetes component that detects and reports node-level issues, including hardware faults, driver errors, and connectivity problems that can affect the performance and availability of GPU workloads.

## About GPU health monitoring in NPD

AKS supports GPU health monitoring through [Node Problem Detector (NPD)](node-problem-detector), enabling automatic detection and reporting of issues that affect GPU-enabled node pools on an AKS cluster. GPU health monitoring helps Kubernetes operators keep GPU nodes healthy and performant by surfacing hardware faults, communication failures, and system-level errors. NPD sets GPU-related node conditions and enable platform engineering teams to take action before issues impact application performance or availability.

These health signals are vital for ensuring optimal performance and reliability across a range of GPU workloads, including:

- Machine learning (ML) training and inference.
- AI model development.
- High-performance computing (HPC).
- Graphics rendering and data-intensive simulations.

## Limitations

AKS Node Problem Detector * does not* run GPU health checks on node pools with

`--gpu-driver none`

, where **self-managed**or custom GPU driver was installed on the nodes.

## Supported GPU health checks

NPD regularly monitors GPU-enabled node pools and sets conditions when anomalies are detected. The following GPU health checks are currently supported:

**GPUMissing**: NPD verifies that the number of GPUs detected by the`nvidia-smi`

utility matches the expected GPU count for the VM SKU assigned to the node.- A mismatch might indicate a hardware fault, driver issue, or misconfiguration. Accurate GPU enumeration is critical for ensuring scheduling accuracy and workload availability on GPU nodes.

**GPUXIDErrors**: Checks for XID (eXecution ID) errors emitted by the GPU driver in the kernel logs. XID errors are low-level GPU faults that typically occur when:- The driver misprograms the GPU.
- There's a corruption in the command stream sent to the GPU.
- A hardware failure or instability affects GPU operation.

For more information, see

[XID errors on NVIDIA GPUs](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/xid-errors/index.html).**NVLink Status**: For NVIDIA VM SKUs that support NVLink, this condition confirms that NVLink is active and functioning.- NVLink is a high-speed interconnect used to facilitate data transfer between multiple GPUs.
- If NVLink is inactive or degraded, multi-GPU workloads might experience reduced performance or communication bottlenecks.

For more information, see

[NVIDIA NVLink](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/).**InfiniBand Link Flapping**: NPD monitors for InfiniBand (IB) link flapping, or intermittent connectivity of the IB network device.- Link flapping shouldn't occur under normal operating conditions and might result in degraded inter-node communication for distributed workloads.
- It can also signal physical layer issues, misconfigured firmware, or driver instability.

**NVIDIA GRID Driver License Check**: For NVIDIA VM SKUs that support GRID driver, this condition verifies license status of the installed GRID driver on[supported NVIDIA VM SKUs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsa10v5-series).- Invalid might indicate the installed GRID driver is not licensed.


## Frequently asked questions

### Does Node Problem Detector (NPD) automatically remediate GPU node issues?

NPD doesn't take direct action to remediate GPU-enabled node issues. NPD detects and reports problems by publishing Kubernetes node conditions and events. Any remediation (for example: draining a node, restarting workloads, or replacing faulty hardware) must be handled manually, through external automation, or alerting systems configured by the Kubernetes operator.

### On which Azure VM sizes does AKS conduct GPU health monitoring through NPD?

Currently, NPD conducts health checks on GPU nodes provisioned with the `Standard_ND96asr_v4`

or `Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5`

VM size on AKS. Also on [A10 SKU](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nvadsa10v5-series) for GRID Driver License checks.

### Does NPD monitor the health of multi-instance GPU (MIG) node pools?

Yes, NPD health monitoring is supported on [MIG-enabled AKS node pools](gpu-multi-instance).
