This article shows you how to use Kubernetes events to monitor and troubleshoot issues in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## What are Kubernetes events?

Events are one of the most prominent sources for monitoring and troubleshooting issues in Kubernetes. They capture and record information about the lifecycle of various Kubernetes objects, such as pods, nodes, services, and deployments. By monitoring events, you can gain visibility into your cluster's activities, identify issues, and troubleshoot problems effectively.

Kubernetes events don't persist throughout your cluster lifecycle, as there's no retention mechanism. Events are **only available for one hour after the event is generated**. To store events for a longer time period, enable

[Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks).

## Kubernetes event objects

The following table lists some key Kubernetes event objects:

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| type | The type is based on the severity of the event:Warning events signal potentially problematic situations, such as a pod repeatedly failing or a node running out of resources. They require attention, but might not result in immediate failure.Normal events represent routine operations, such as a pod being scheduled or a deployment scaling up. They usually indicate healthy cluster behavior. |
| reason | The reason why the event was generated. For example, FailedScheduling or CrashLoopBackoff. |
| message | A human-readable message that describes the event. |
| namespace | The namespace of the Kubernetes object that the event is associated with. |
| firstSeen | Timestamp when the event was first observed. |
| lastSeen | Timestamp of when the event was last observed. |
| reportingController | The name of the controller that reported the event. For example, `kubernetes.io/kubelet` . |
| object | The name of the Kubernetes object that the event is associated with. |

For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/).

## View Kubernetes events

List all events in your cluster using the `kubectl get events`

command.

Assuming your cluster is already created and available (per doc prerequisites), get credentials (note the `--overwrite-existing`

flag is set to avoid kubeconfig errors):

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --overwrite-existing
```


Now list all events in your cluster:

```
kubectl get events
```


Results:

```
LAST SEEN TYPE REASON OBJECT MESSAGE
xxm Normal Scheduled pod/my-pod-xxxxx Successfully assigned default/my-pod-xxxxx to aks-nodepoolxx-xxxxxxx-vmss000000
xxm Normal Pulled pod/my-pod-xxxxx Container image "nginx" already present on machine
xxm Normal Created pod/my-pod-xxxxx Created container nginx
xxm Normal Started pod/my-pod-xxxxx Started container nginx
...
```


Look at a specific pod's events by first finding the name of the pod and then using the `kubectl describe pod`

command.

List the pods in the current namespace:

```
kubectl get pods
```


Results:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-pod-xxxxx 1/1 Running 0 xxm
nginx-deployment-xxxxx 1/1 Running 0 xxm
...
```


Replace `<pod-name>`

below with your actual pod name. For automation, here's an example for the first pod in the list:

```
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl describe pod $POD_NAME
```


## Best practices for troubleshooting with events

### Filtering events for relevance

You might have various namespaces and services running in your AKS cluster. Filtering events based on object type, namespace, or reason can help narrow down the results to the most relevant information.

For example, you can use the following command to filter events within the default namespace:

```
kubectl get events --namespace default
```


### Automating event notifications

To ensure timely response to critical events in your AKS cluster, set up automated notifications. Azure offers integration with monitoring and alerting services like [Azure Monitor](monitor-aks). You can configure alerts to trigger based on specific event patterns. This way, you're immediately informed about crucial issues that require attention.

### Regularly reviewing events

Make a habit of regularly reviewing events in your AKS cluster. This proactive approach can help you identify trends, catch potential problems early, and prevent escalations. By staying on top of events, you can maintain the stability and performance of your applications.

# Quickstart: Generate ConfigMap from Azure App Configuration

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can externalize the configurations of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads and manage them in [Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview). The [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/artifact/mar/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) runs as a container in your cluster. Key benefits include:

**Seamless integration**: Pulls data from Azure App Configuration and Key Vault, making them accessible as ConfigMap and Secret without code changes in your workloads.**Dynamic update**: Built-in caching and refreshing capabilities for dynamic configuration, feature flagging, and automatic secret rotation.

The Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider is available as an AKS extension. By following this document, you can easily install the extension and connect your AKS cluster with an App Configuration store using the Service Connector in the Azure portal. For information on setting up the provider using Helm, see the [Quickstart for Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - A running workload in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. If you don't have one, you can
[create a demo application running in AKS](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#create-an-application-running-in-aks).

## Create a service connection to App Configuration

Create a service connection between your AKS cluster and your App Configuration store using Microsoft Entra Workload Identity.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource.Select

**Settings**>**Service Connector**>**Create**.On the

**Basics**tab, configure the following settings:**Kubernetes namespace**: Specify the namespace you'd like to create ConfigMap or Secret to.**Service type**: Select**App Configuration**.**Use App Configuration Extension on Kubernetes**: Check the box to use the[Azure App Configuration AKS extension](azure-app-configuration)for this connection. Azure App Configuration AKS extension will be installed to current cluster if it's not yet.**Connection name**: Enter a connection name or use the default name.**Subscription**: Select the subscription of your App Configuration store.**App Configuration**: Select your App Configuration store. If you don't have one, click**Create new**to set one up.

Select

**Next: Authentication**. On the**Authentication**tab, keep the default selection of**Workload Identity**, select a**User assigned managed identity**you want to use. If you don't have one, click**Create new**to set one up.Select

**Next: Networking**and use the default settings.Select

**Next: Review + create**and wait for the validation to pass.Select

**Create**to create the service connection.

Note

The Service Connector simplifies the installation of the Azure App Configuration AKS extension from the Azure portal. You can also install it without Service Connector using Azure CLI, Bicep, or an ARM template. For more information, see [Install Azure App Configuration AKS extension](azure-app-configuration).

## Generate ConfigMap from App Configuration

Update the service connection to create and deploy an `AzureAppConfigurationProvider`

YAML resource in your AKS cluster. This resource generates a ConfigMap with data from your App Configuration store.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource and select**Settings**>**Service Connector**.Select the newly created connection, select

**Yaml snippet**in the top menu.On the

**AzureAppConfigurationProvider**tab, configure the following settings:**Using configuration as**: Choose to consume the configuration as a**mounted file**or**environment variables**.**Mounted file**: If selected, specify the**file type**and**file name**.**Selector**: Set the**Key filter**and**Label filter**to load data from your App Configuration store.

A YAML is generated based on your input. Click

**Apply**to add it to your AKS cluster. It will create a ConfigMap in your AKS cluster with data from your App Configuration store.Click

**Next**. On the**Workload**tab, configure the following settings:**File mount path**: Specify the file mount path if the mounted file option was selected.**Kubernetes Workload**: Select the workload where the generated ConfigMap will be injected.- Click
**Apply**to update the workload.
