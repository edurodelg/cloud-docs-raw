Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.
