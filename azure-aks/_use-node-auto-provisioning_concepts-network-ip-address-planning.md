Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

If you want to create a NAP-enabled AKS cluster with a custom virtual network (VNet) and subnets, see [Create a node auto-provisioning (NAP) cluster in a custom virtual network](node-auto-provisioning-custom-vnet).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the [Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning) article, which details [how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work), [prerequisites](node-auto-provisioning#prerequisites) and [limitations](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features).

## Enable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

The following sections explain how to enable NAP on a new or existing AKS cluster:

Note

You can enable [control plane metrics](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from [node auto-provisioning](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).

### Enable NAP on a new cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

. The following command also sets the`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Create a file named

`nap.json`

and add the following ARM template configuration with the`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field set to`Auto`

, which enables NAP. (The default setting is`Manual`

.)`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Auto" } } } ] }`

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az deployment group create`

`--template-file`

flag set to the path of the ARM template file.`az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --template-file ./nap.json`


### Enable NAP on an existing cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --node-provisioning-mode Auto`


## Disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

Important

You can only disable NAP on a cluster if the following conditions are met:

- There are no existing NAP nodes. You can use the
`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command to check for existing NAP-managed nodes. - All existing Karpenter
have their`NodePools`

`spec.limits.cpu`

field set to`0`

. This action prevents new nodes from being created, but doesn't disrupt currently running nodes.

Set the

`spec.limits.cpu`

field to`0`

for every existing Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: limits: cpu: 0`

Important

If you don't want to ensure that every pod previously running on a NAP node is safely migrated to a non-NAP node before disabling NAP, you can skip steps 2 and 3 and instead use the

`kubectl delete node`

command for each NAP-managed node. However,**we don't recommend skipping these steps**, as it might leave some pods pending and doesn't honor Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs).When using the

`kubectl delete node`

command, be careful to only delete NAP-managed nodes. You can identify NAP-managed nodes using the`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command.Add the

`karpenter.azure.com/disable:NoSchedule`

taint to every Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: template: spec: ... taints: - key: karpenter.azure.com/disable effect: NoSchedule`

This action starts the process of migrating the workloads on the NAP-managed nodes to non-NAP nodes, honoring PDBs and disruption limits. Pods migrate to non-NAP nodes if they can fit. If there isn't enough fixed-size capacity, some node NAP-managed nodes remain.

Scale up existing fixed-size

`ManagedCluster`

`AgentPools`

or create new fixed-size`AgentPools`

to take the load from the node NAP-managed nodes. As these nodes are added to the cluster, the node NAP-managed nodes are drained, and work is migrated to the fixed-size nodes.Delete all NAP-managed nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command. If NAP-managed nodes still exist, the cluster likely lacks fixed-size capacity. In this case, you should add more nodes so the remaining workloads can be migrated.

Update the NAP mode to

`Manual`

using theAzure CLI command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Manual`

.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Manual`


Update the

`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field to`Manual`

in your ARM template and redeploy it.`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Manual" } } } ] }`

This article provides guidance on IP address planning for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

For specific guidance on IP address planning for individual CNI options, see the [next steps](#next-steps) section for links to plugin documentation.

## Subnet sizing

Your Azure VNet subnet must be large enough to accommodate your cluster, which depends on whether you're using an [overlay network](#overlay-networks) or a [flat network](#flat-networks).

### Overlay networks

With overlay networks, like [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay), your subnet needs to be large enough to assign IPs to your nodes. Pods are assigned IPs from a separate, private CIDR range and won't require VNet IPs. The VNet subnet you use for your cluster can be smaller than with flat networks.

It's important to ensure you allocate enough space in your private CIDR range for your pods to account for scaling. When planning your IP address range sizes, you should calculate your maximum pod count. Each node in your cluster is assigned a /24 (256 IP addresses) subnet for pods. You should plan your overlay network subnet to accommodate the maximum number of nodes you expect to run.

### Flat networks

Flat networks, like [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), require a large enough subnet to accommodate both nodes *and* pods. Since nodes and pods receive IPs from your VNet, you need to plan for the maximum number of nodes and pods you expect to run. Azure CNI Pod Subnet uses a subnet for your nodes and a separate subnet for your pods, so you need to plan for both.

## IP address sizing

### Upgrading and scaling considerations

When IP address planning for your AKS cluster, you should **consider the number of IP addresses required for upgrade and scaling operations**. If you set the IP address range to only support a fixed number of nodes, you won't be able to upgrade or scale your cluster.

When you **upgrade** your AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node, and an older node is removed from the cluster. This rolling upgrade process requires a minimum of one additional block of IP addresses to be available. Your node count is then `n + 1`

where `n`

is the number of nodes in your cluster.

When you **scale** an AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node. Your IP address range needs to take into considerations how you want to scale up the number of nodes and pods your cluster can support. A minimum of one additional node for upgrade operations or the number of nodes set by the [Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) option should also be included. Your node count is then `n + number-of-additional-scaled-nodes-you-anticipate + max surge`

.

If you're using [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) and you expect your nodes to run the maximum number of pods and you regularly destroy and deploy pods, you should also factor in extra IP addresses per node. There can be few seconds latency required to delete a service and release its IP address for a new service to be deployed and acquire the address. The extra IP addresses account for this possibility.

The IP address plan for an AKS cluster consists of a virtual network, at least one subnet for nodes and pods, and a Kubernetes service address range.

| Azure Resource | Address Range | Limits and Sizing |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Virtual Network | Max size /8. 65,536 configured IP address limit. See
|

Use the following equation to calculate the minimum subnet size, including an extra node for upgrade operations: `(number of nodes + max surge nodes) + ((number of nodes + max surge nodes) * maximum pods per node that you configure)`


Example for a 50-node cluster: `(51) + (51 * 30 (default)) = 1,581`

(/21 or larger)

Example for a 50-node cluster, preparing to scale up an extra 10 nodes with the default max surge of 1 node: `(61) + (61 * 30 (default)) = 1,891`

(/21 or larger)

If you don't specify a maximum number of pods per node when you create your cluster, the maximum number of pods per node is set to 30. The minimum number of IP addresses required is based on that value. If you calculate your minimum IP address requirements on a different maximum value, see [Maximum pods per node](#maximum-pods-per-node) to set this value when you deploy your cluster.

*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*address.## Maximum pods per node

The maximum number of pods per node in an AKS cluster is 250. The *default* maximum number of pods per node varies between *kubenet* and *Azure CNI* networking, and the method of cluster deployment.

| CNI | Default max pods | Configurable at deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | 250 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI Pod subnet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI (Legacy) | 30 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Kubenet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |

## Configuring maximum pods per node for your clusters

You can configure the maximum number of pods per node either at cluster deployment time or as you add new node pools. You can set the maximum pods per node value as high as 250.

A minimum value for maximum pods per node is enforced to guarantee space for system pods critical to cluster health. The minimum value that can be set for maximum pods per node is 10 if and only if the configuration of each node pool has space for a minimum of 30 pods. For example, setting the maximum pods per node to the minimum of 10 requires each individual node pool to have a minimum of three nodes. This requirement applies for each new node pool created as well, so if 10 is defined as maximum pods per node each subsequent node pool added must have at least three nodes.

| Networking | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI | 10 | 250 |
| Kubenet | 10 | 250 |

Note

The minimum value in the previous table is strictly enforced by the AKS service. You cannot set a value for *maxPods* that is lower than the minimum shown, as doing so can prevent the cluster from starting.

### New clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new cluster using one of the following methods:

**Azure CLI**: Specify the`--max-pods`

argument when you deploy a cluster with thecommand.`az aks create`

**Azure Resource Manager template**: Specify the`maxPods`

property in the [ManagedClusterAgentPoolProfile] object when you deploy a cluster with an Azure Resource Manager template.**Azure portal**: Change the`Max pods per node`

field in the node pool settings when creating a cluster or adding a new node pool.

### Existing clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new node pool. If you need to increase the *maxPods* setting on an existing cluster, add a new node pool with the new desired *maxPods* count. After migrating your pods to the new pool, delete the node older pool.
