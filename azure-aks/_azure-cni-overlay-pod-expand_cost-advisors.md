# Expand pod CIDR space in Azure CNI Overlay Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can expand your pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) space on Azure CNI Overlay clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service with Linux nodes only. The operation uses the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_update) command and allows expansions without the need to re-create your AKS cluster.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Requirements and parameters

| Requirement or parameter | Supported versions or values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Feature flag | `EnableAzureCNIOverlayPodCIDRExpansion` |
This feature flag must be registered in your subscription to enable pod CIDR expansion in Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters. |
| Azure CLI version | 2.48.0 or later | The Azure CLI version must be 2.48.0 or later to support the pod CIDR expansion feature. |
| Kubernetes version | 1.33 | Pod CIDR expansion is supported only on AKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.33. |
| Node operating system | Linux | Pod CIDR expansion is supported only on Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters with Linux nodes. |
| Networking mode | Azure CNI Overlay | Pod CIDR expansion is supported only on AKS clusters that use Azure CNI Overlay networking. |
| Example original pod CIDR | `10.244.0.0/18` |
This is an example of a starting pod CIDR block. |
| Example expanded pod CIDR | `10.244.0.0/16` |
This is an example of a target expanded pod CIDR block. |

## Limitations

- Windows nodes and hybrid node scenarios aren't supported.
- Shrinking or changing the pod CIDR isn't supported.
- Adding a discontinuous pod CIDR isn't supported. The new pod CIDR must be a larger superset that contains the complete original range.
- IPv6 pod CIDR expansion isn't supported.
- Changing multiple pod CIDR blocks via
`--pod-cidrs`

isn't supported. - If an
[Azure availability zone](availability-zones)is down during the expansion operation, new nodes might appear as`unready`

. You can expect these nodes to reconcile after the availability zone is up.

## Prerequisites

- You need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)before you begin. - Ensure that you meet the requirements listed in the
[Requirements and parameters](#requirements-and-parameters)section.

## Register the `EnableAzureCNIOverlayPodCIDRExpansion`

feature flag

Register the

`EnableAzureCNIOverlayPodCIDRExpansion`

feature flag by using thecommand:`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name EnableAzureCNIOverlayPodCIDRExpansion`

Verify successful registration by using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the registration to finish.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnableAzureCNIOverlayPodCIDRExpansion"`

After the feature shows

`Registered`

, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider by using thecommand:`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Update an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster to expand the pod CIDR space

Starting from a pod CIDR block of

`10.244.0.0/18`

, you can expand the pod CIDR space by using thecommand. For example:`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --pod-cidr 10.244.0.0/16`

Note

Although the update operation might successfully finish and show the new pod CIDR in the network profile, be sure to validate the new cluster state through

`NodeNetworkConfig`

(`nnc`

).Verify the state of the upgrade operation by checking

`NodeNetworkConfig`

(`nnc`

) via the`kubectl get nnc`

command. In the output, all node pools should match your new pod CIDR block (for example,`10.244.0.0/16`

).`kubectl get nnc -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{" "}{.status.networkContainers[0].subnetAddressSpace}{"\n"}{end}'`

# Get Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost recommendations in Azure Advisor

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS cost recommendations in Azure Advisor follow AKS cost best practices and help you optimize your deployments to achieve cost-efficiency without compromising on reliability. Advisor analyzes your resource configuration and recommends solutions to optimize your AKS cluster.

With Advisor, you can:

- Get proactive, actionable, and personalized best practices recommendations.
- Identify opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend.
- Get recommendations with proposed actions inline.

Cost is one of five categories that Advisor recommendations can fall into. Other categories include reliability, security, performance, and operational excellence. For more information, see the
[Introduction to Azure Advisor](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

## Prerequisites

- To access Advisor recommendations you must have one of the following roles: Owner, Contributor, or Reader of a subscription, resource group, or resource.

## AKS cost recommendations

Recommendations are available for all clusters, but only the ones relevant to the cluster configuration and historical usage will be surfaced. There is no action required by the customer to enable Azure Advisor, as it is a provided by default for all Azure services out of box.

AKS cost recommendations include the following:

- Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler recommendation mode to rightsize resource requests and limits.
- Use Azure Kubernetes Service Cost Analysis.
- Fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile for rapid scale down and cost savings.

For more information, see [Cost recommendations](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-reference-cost-recommendations#azure-kubernetes-service).

### Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler recommendation mode to rightsize resource requests and limits

Setting the correct request and limit values is difficult given the required amount of resources can vary greatly across workloads. Managing this at scale across hundreds or thousands of pods is an even greater challenge. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests and limits for your pods based on historical workload usage patterns to improve resource utilization.

If you don't want VPA to automatically adjust the values and want additional control, VPA recommendation only mode provides suggested values without making automatic changes. This enables you to review and implement suggested values manually, which can prevent potential disruptions and ensure better control over resource allocation. VPA recommendation mode is a great option to help prevent over-provisioning, a major driver of unnecessary spend.

For more information, see [Vertical pod autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](vertical-pod-autoscaler#vpa-overview).

### Use Azure Kubernetes Service cost analysis

AKS cost analysis add-on provides detailed insights into the cost of resources used by your AKS cluster. View costs broken down by Kubernetes constructs like clusters and namespaces. This feature helps you identify cost drivers, track historical trends, identify anomalies and clusters or workloads with optimization opportunities. Having cost monitoring in place is an easy way to get visibility into cluster spend and take action to achieve significant cost savings.

Note

This recommendation is only available for public cloud clusters running in Enterprise or MCA type subscriptions.

For more information, see [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost analysis](cost-analysis).

### Fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile for rapid scale down and cost savings

The cluster autoscaler profile is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler, which automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster based on workload demand. Tuning these settings allows greater control over autoscaler behavior to optimize resource allocation for specific scenarios. A rapid scale down configuration means more aggressive node scale, which means less idle node costs.

For more information, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down).

You can view recommendations on the Advisor dashboard in Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure Advisor portal basics](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-get-started).
