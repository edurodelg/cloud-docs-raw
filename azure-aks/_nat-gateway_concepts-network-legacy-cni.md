Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


```
az aks create \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--node-count 3 \
--outbound-type managedNATGateway \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 2 \
--nat-gateway-idle-timeout 4 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


- Update the outbound IP address or idle timeout using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

or`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameter.

The following example updates the NAT gateway managed outbound IP count for the AKS cluster to 5.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 5
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ... "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" }`


## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx/agentPools/mynpxxx", "name": "mynpxxx", "osType": "Windows", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools" }`

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet frequently asked questions

**Can I use a different subnet within my cluster virtual network for the***Kubernetes service address range*?It's not recommended, but this configuration is possible. The service address range is a set of virtual IPs (VIPs) that Kubernetes assigns to internal services in your cluster. Azure Networking has no visibility into the service IP range of the Kubernetes cluster. The lack of visibility into the cluster's service address range can lead to issues. It's possible to later create a new subnet in the cluster virtual network that overlaps with the service address range. If such an overlap occurs, Kubernetes could assign a service an IP that's already in use by another resource in the subnet, causing unpredictable behavior or failures. By ensuring you use an address range outside the cluster's virtual network, you can avoid this overlap risk. Yes, when you deploy a cluster with the Azure CLI or a Resource Manager template. See
