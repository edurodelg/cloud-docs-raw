This article shows you how to stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes.

## Overview

To stay within a supported Kubernetes version, you have to upgrade your cluster at least once per year and prepare for all possible disruptions. These disruptions include ones caused by API breaking changes, deprecations, and dependencies such as Helm and Container Storage Interface (CSI). It can be difficult to anticipate these disruptions and migrate critical workloads without experiencing any downtime.

You can configure your AKS cluster to automatically stop upgrade operations consisting of a minor version change with deprecated APIs and alert you to the issue. This feature helps you avoid unexpected disruptions and gives you time to address the deprecated APIs before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- The upgrade operation is a Kubernetes minor version change for the cluster control plane.
- The Kubernetes version you're upgrading to is 1.26 or later.
- The last seen usage of deprecated APIs for the targeted version you're upgrading to must occur within 12 hours before the upgrade operation. AKS records usage hourly, so any usage of deprecated APIs within one hour isn't guaranteed to appear in the detection.

## Mitigate stopped upgrade operations

If you meet the [prerequisites](#before-you-begin), attempt an upgrade, and receive an error message similar to the following example error message:

```
Bad Request({
"code": "ValidationError",
"message": "Control Plane upgrade is blocked due to recent usage of a Kubernetes API deprecated in the specified version. Please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide to migrate the usage. To bypass this error, set enable-force-upgrade in upgradeSettings.overrideSettings. Bypassing this error without migrating usage will result in the deprecated Kubernetes API calls failing. Usage details: 1 error occurred:\n\t* usage has been detected on API flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io.prioritylevelconfigurations.v1beta1, and was recently seen at: 2023-03-23 20:57:18 +0000 UTC, which will be removed in 1.26\n\n",
"subcode": "UpgradeBlockedOnDeprecatedAPIUsage"
})
```


You have two options to mitigate the issue: you can [remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)](#remove-usage-of-deprecated-apis-recommended) or [bypass validation to ignore API changes](#bypass-validation-to-ignore-api-changes).

### Remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)

In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster resource and select

**Diagnose and solve problems**Select

**Create, Upgrade, Delete, and Scale**>**Kubernetes API deprecations**.Wait 12 hours from the time the last deprecated API usage was seen. Read-Only verbs are excluded from the deprecated api usage namely

[Get/List/Watch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/).(You can also check past API usage by enabling[Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query#resource-logs)and exploring kube audit logs.)Retry your cluster upgrade.


### Bypass validation to ignore API changes

Note

This method requires you to use the Azure CLI version 2.57 or later. If you have the preview CLI extension installed, you need to update to version `3.0.0b10`

or later. This method isn't recommended, as deprecated APIs in the targeted Kubernetes version might not work long term. We recommend removing them as soon as possible after the upgrade completes.

Bypass validation to ignore API breaking changes and invoke an upgrade. Specify the

`enable-force-upgrade`

flag and set the`upgrade-override-until`

property to define the end of the window during which validation is bypassed. If no value is set, it defaults the window to three days from the current time. The date and time you specify must be in the future.`az aks upgrade --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --kubernetes-version $KUBERNETES_VERSION --enable-force-upgrade --upgrade-override-until 2023-10-01T13:00:00Z`

Note

`Z`

is the zone designator for the zero UTC/GMT offset, also known as 'Zulu' time. This example sets the end of the window to`13:00:00`

GMT. For more information, see[Combined date and time representations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).

# Update Azure CNI IPAM mode and data plane technology for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters inevitably need an update to newer IP assignment management (IPAM) modes and data plane technologies to access the latest features and supportability. This article provides guidance on updating an existing AKS cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay for the IPAM mode and Azure CNI Powered by Cilium as the data plane.

## Update the IPAM mode to Azure CNI Overlay

Updating an existing cluster to Azure CNI Overlay is an irreversible process.

You can update an existing AKS cluster to Azure CNI Overlay if the cluster:

- Is on Kubernetes version 1.27 or later.
- Doesn't use the
[dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)feature. - Doesn't have network policies enabled. If you need to uninstall the network policy engine before updating your cluster, follow the steps in
[Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico). - Doesn't use any Windows node pools with Docker as the container runtime.

Before Windows OS build 20348.1668, there was a limitation around Windows overlay pods incorrectly routing packets from host network pods via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). This limitation had a detrimental effect for clusters that were updating to Azure CNI Overlay. To avoid this issue, use Windows OS build 20348.1668 or later.

Warning

If you're using a custom

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

configuration to include additional IP ranges that shouldn't send SNAT packets from pods, updating to Azure CNI Overlay can break connectivity to these ranges. Pod IPs from the overlay space are unreachable by anything outside the cluster nodes.For old clusters, a ConfigMap might be left over from a previous version of

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

. If this ConfigMap (named`azure-ip-masq-agent-config`

) exists and isn't intentionally in place, you should delete it before updating.If you're not using a custom

`ip-masq-agent`

configuration, only the`azure-ip-masq-agent-config-reconciled`

ConfigMap should exist with respect to Azure`ip-masq-agent`

ConfigMap. It's updated automatically during the update process.

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately to Azure CNI Overlay isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or Kubernetes version upgrade where each node in a node pool is reimaged.

Update an existing Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16
```


The `--pod-cidr`

parameter is required when you update from legacy CNI plugins because the pods need to get IPs from a new overlay space. The new overlay space doesn't overlap with the existing Azure CNI Node Subnet plugin.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

Warning

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium begins enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

To perform the update, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-dataplane cilium
```
