Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

CLI installed and updated. Install it locally using the`az aks install-cli`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use throughout the article. Replace the placeholder values with your own values.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export LOCATION="<location>" export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>" export DNS_NAME_PREFIX="<dns-name-prefix>"`


## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group for the AKS cluster using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

,`--enable-managed-identity`

,`--enable-aad`

, and`--dns-name-prefix`

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

To start building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines, see the following articles:

# Automated deployments for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Automated Deployments streamline the process of setting up a GitHub Action or Azure DevOps Pipeline, making it easy to create a continuous deployment pipeline for your application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Once connected, every new commit automatically triggers the pipeline, delivering updates to your application seamlessly. You can either bring your own deployment files for quick pipeline creation or generate Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests to containerize and deploy non-containerized applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account or an Azure DevOps organization.
- An AKS cluster. If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - An Azure Container Registry (ACR). If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Integrate Azure Container Registry (ACR) with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](cluster-container-registry-integration). - An application to deploy.

### Connect to source code repository

Create an automated deployment workflow and authorize it to connect to the desired source code repository.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Automated deployments**>**Create**. - Under
**Repository details**, enter a name for the workflow, then select**GitHub or ADO**for your repository location. - Select
**Authorize access**to connect to the desired repository. - Choose the
**Repository**and**Branch**, and then select**Next**.

### Choose the container image configuration

To get an application ready for Kubernetes, you need to build it into a container image and store it in a container registry. You use a Dockerfile to provide instructions on how to build the container image. If your source code repository doesn't already have a Dockerfile, Automated Deployments can generate one for you. Otherwise, you can use an existing Dockerfile.

Use Automated Deployments to generate a Dockerfile for many languages and frameworks such as Go, C#, Node.js, Python, Java, Gradle, Clojure, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Swift, and Rust. The language support is built on what's available in [draft.sh](https://draft.sh).

- Select
**Auto-containerize (generate Dockerfile)**for the container configuration. - Select the
**location of where to save the generated Dockerfile**in the repository. - Select the
**application environment**from the list of supported languages and frameworks. - Enter the
**application port**. - Provide the
**Dockerfile build context**path. - Select an existing
**Azure Container Registry**or create a new one. This registry is used to store the built application image.

### Choose the Kubernetes manifest configuration

Note

The Generate Manifests option also supports advanced features like Service Connector integration, auto-generated Ingress resources, and more detailed, customizable Kubernetes manifest files.

An application running on Kubernetes consists of many Kubernetes primitive components. These components describe what container image to use, how many replicas to run, if there's a public IP required to expose the application, etc. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation][kubernetes-documentation]. If your source code repository doesn't already have the basic Kubernetes manifests to deploy, Automated Deployments can generate them for you. Otherwise, you can use a set of existing manifests. You can also choose an existing Helm chart.

If your code repository already has a Dockerfile, you can select it to be used to build the application image.

- Select
**Use existing Kubernetes manifest deployment files**for the deployment options. - Select the
**Kubernetes manifest file or folder**from your repository. - Select
**Next**.

## (Optional) Use a managed ingress and/or Service Connector

When generating Kubernetes manifests with Automated Deployments, you can optionally enable App Routing to set up an ingress controller for your application. You can also use Service Connector to create a new connection or seamlessly integrate your app with an existing Azure service backend.

App Routing provides a fully managed NGINX-based ingress controller out of the box, complete with built-in SSL/TLS encryption using certificates stored in Azure Key Vault and DNS zone management through Azure DNS. When using Automated Deployments, the expose ingress command integrates seamlessly with App Routing, making it easy to expose your application to external traffic under a secure, custom DNS name—with minimal configuration.

- Select the
**Expose ingress**box. - Choose between an
**Existing ingress controller**or a**New ingress controller**. - Choose between using a
**SSL/TLS enabled**or**Insecure**ingress controller. - (Optional) Enter
**Certificate details**if choosing a**SSL/TLS enabled**ingress controller. - Choose between using
**Azure DNS**or a**3rd party provider**. - Enter the
**Azure DNS Zone**and**Subdomain name**.

## (Optional) Add environment variables

Define environment variables for a container in Kubernetes by specifying name-value pairs. Environment variables are important as they help enable easier management of settings, secure handling of sensitive information, and flexibility across environments.

## Review configuration and deploy

Review the configuration for the application, and Kubernetes manifests, then select **Deploy**. A pull request (PR) will be generated against the repository that you selected, so don't navigate away from deployment page.

### Review and merge pull request

When the deployment succeeds, select **View pull request** to view the details of the generated pull request on your code repository.

- Review the changes under
**Files changed**and make any desired edits. - Select
**Merge pull request**to merge the changes into your code repository.

Merging the change runs the GitHub Actions workflow that builds your application into a container image, stores it in Azure Container Registry, and deploys it to the cluster.

### Check the deployed resources

After the pipeline is completed, you can review the created Kubernetes `Service`

in the Azure portal by selecting **Services and ingresses** under the **Kubernetes resources** section of the service menu.

Selecting the **External IP** should open up a new browser page with the running application.

## Delete resources

Once you're done with your cluster, use the following steps to delete it to avoid incurring Azure charges:

- In the Azure portal, navigate to
**Automated deployments** - Select
**...**on the pipeline of your choice. - Select
**Delete**.
