This article provides guidance on IP address planning for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

For specific guidance on IP address planning for individual CNI options, see the [next steps](#next-steps) section for links to plugin documentation.

## Subnet sizing

Your Azure VNet subnet must be large enough to accommodate your cluster, which depends on whether you're using an [overlay network](#overlay-networks) or a [flat network](#flat-networks).

### Overlay networks

With overlay networks, like [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay), your subnet needs to be large enough to assign IPs to your nodes. Pods are assigned IPs from a separate, private CIDR range and won't require VNet IPs. The VNet subnet you use for your cluster can be smaller than with flat networks.

It's important to ensure you allocate enough space in your private CIDR range for your pods to account for scaling. When planning your IP address range sizes, you should calculate your maximum pod count. Each node in your cluster is assigned a /24 (256 IP addresses) subnet for pods. You should plan your overlay network subnet to accommodate the maximum number of nodes you expect to run.

### Flat networks

Flat networks, like [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), require a large enough subnet to accommodate both nodes *and* pods. Since nodes and pods receive IPs from your VNet, you need to plan for the maximum number of nodes and pods you expect to run. Azure CNI Pod Subnet uses a subnet for your nodes and a separate subnet for your pods, so you need to plan for both.

## IP address sizing

### Upgrading and scaling considerations

When IP address planning for your AKS cluster, you should **consider the number of IP addresses required for upgrade and scaling operations**. If you set the IP address range to only support a fixed number of nodes, you won't be able to upgrade or scale your cluster.

When you **upgrade** your AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node, and an older node is removed from the cluster. This rolling upgrade process requires a minimum of one additional block of IP addresses to be available. Your node count is then `n + 1`

where `n`

is the number of nodes in your cluster.

When you **scale** an AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node. Your IP address range needs to take into considerations how you want to scale up the number of nodes and pods your cluster can support. A minimum of one additional node for upgrade operations or the number of nodes set by the [Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) option should also be included. Your node count is then `n + number-of-additional-scaled-nodes-you-anticipate + max surge`

.

If you're using [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) and you expect your nodes to run the maximum number of pods and you regularly destroy and deploy pods, you should also factor in extra IP addresses per node. There can be few seconds latency required to delete a service and release its IP address for a new service to be deployed and acquire the address. The extra IP addresses account for this possibility.

The IP address plan for an AKS cluster consists of a virtual network, at least one subnet for nodes and pods, and a Kubernetes service address range.

| Azure Resource | Address Range | Limits and Sizing |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Virtual Network | Max size /8. 65,536 configured IP address limit. See
|

Use the following equation to calculate the minimum subnet size, including an extra node for upgrade operations: `(number of nodes + max surge nodes) + ((number of nodes + max surge nodes) * maximum pods per node that you configure)`


Example for a 50-node cluster: `(51) + (51 * 30 (default)) = 1,581`

(/21 or larger)

Example for a 50-node cluster, preparing to scale up an extra 10 nodes with the default max surge of 1 node: `(61) + (61 * 30 (default)) = 1,891`

(/21 or larger)

If you don't specify a maximum number of pods per node when you create your cluster, the maximum number of pods per node is set to 30. The minimum number of IP addresses required is based on that value. If you calculate your minimum IP address requirements on a different maximum value, see [Maximum pods per node](#maximum-pods-per-node) to set this value when you deploy your cluster.

*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*address.## Maximum pods per node

The maximum number of pods per node in an AKS cluster is 250. The *default* maximum number of pods per node varies between *kubenet* and *Azure CNI* networking, and the method of cluster deployment.

| CNI | Default max pods | Configurable at deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | 250 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI Pod subnet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI (Legacy) | 30 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Kubenet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |

## Configuring maximum pods per node for your clusters

You can configure the maximum number of pods per node either at cluster deployment time or as you add new node pools. You can set the maximum pods per node value as high as 250.

A minimum value for maximum pods per node is enforced to guarantee space for system pods critical to cluster health. The minimum value that can be set for maximum pods per node is 10 if and only if the configuration of each node pool has space for a minimum of 30 pods. For example, setting the maximum pods per node to the minimum of 10 requires each individual node pool to have a minimum of three nodes. This requirement applies for each new node pool created as well, so if 10 is defined as maximum pods per node each subsequent node pool added must have at least three nodes.

| Networking | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI | 10 | 250 |
| Kubenet | 10 | 250 |

Note

The minimum value in the previous table is strictly enforced by the AKS service. You cannot set a value for *maxPods* that is lower than the minimum shown, as doing so can prevent the cluster from starting.

### New clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new cluster using one of the following methods:

**Azure CLI**: Specify the`--max-pods`

argument when you deploy a cluster with thecommand.`az aks create`

**Azure Resource Manager template**: Specify the`maxPods`

property in the [ManagedClusterAgentPoolProfile] object when you deploy a cluster with an Azure Resource Manager template.**Azure portal**: Change the`Max pods per node`

field in the node pool settings when creating a cluster or adding a new node pool.

### Existing clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new node pool. If you need to increase the *maxPods* setting on an existing cluster, add a new node pool with the new desired *maxPods* count. After migrating your pods to the new pool, delete the node older pool.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn about machine learning operations (MLOps), including what types of practices and tools are involved, and how it can simplify and speed up your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What is MLOps?

Machine learning operations (MLOps) encompasses practices that facilitate collaboration between data scientists, IT operations, and business stakeholders, ensuring that machine learning models are developed, deployed, and maintained efficiently. MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, aiming to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes training, packaging, validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models.

MLOps requires multiple roles and tools to work together effectively. Data scientists focus on tasks related to training the model, which is referred to as the * inner loop*. Machine learning engineers and IT operations teams handle the

*, where they apply DevOps practices to package, validate, deploy, and monitor models. When the model needs fine-tuning or retraining, the process loops back to the inner loop.*

**outer loop**### MLOps pipeline

Your MLOps pipeline may leverage various tools and microservices that are deployed sequentially or in parallel. Below are examples of key components in your pipeline that benefit from implementing the following best practices to reduce overhead and allow for faster iteration:

- Unstructured data store for new data flowing into your application
- Vector database to store and query structured, pre-processed data
- Data ingestion and indexing framework
- Vector ingestion and/or model retraining workflows
- Metrics collection and alerting tools (tracking model performance, volume of ingested data, etc.)
- Lifecycle management tools

## DevOps and MLOps

DevOps is a combination of tools and practices that enable you to create robust and reproducible applications. The goal of using DevOps is to quickly deliver value to your end users. Creating, deploying, and monitoring robust and reproducible models to deliver value to end users is the primary goal of MLOps.

There are *three* processes that are essential to MLOps:

**Machine learning workloads**for which a data scientist is responsible, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training and tuning.**Software development practices**including planning, developing, testing, and packaging the model for deployment.**Operational aspects of deploying and maintaining the model in production**, including releasing, configuring resources, and monitoring the model.

### DevOps principles that apply to MLOps

MLOps leverages several principles from DevOps to enhance the machine learning lifecycle, such as *automation*, *continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)*, *source control*, *Agile planning*, and *infrastructure as code (IaC)*.

#### Automation

By automating tasks, you can reduce manual errors, increase efficiency, and ensure consistency across the ML lifecycle. Automation can be applied to various stages, including data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Through automation, you can also apply proactive measures in the AI pipeline to ensure data compliance with your organization's policies.

For example, your pipeline can automate:

- Model tuning/retraining at regular time intervals or when a certain amount of new data is collected in your application.
- Detection of performance degradation to kickstart fine-tuning or retraining on a different subset of data.
- Common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) scanning on base container images pulled from external container registries to ensure safe security practices.

#### Continuous integration (CI)

Continuous integration covers the *creating* and *verifying* aspects of the model development process. The goal of CI is to create the code and to verify the quality of the code and the model before deployment. This includes testing on a range of sample data sets to ensure that the model performs as expected and meets quality standards.

In MLOps, CI might involve:

- Refactoring exploratory code in Jupyter notebooks into Python or R scripts.
- Validating new input data for missing or error values.
- Unit testing and integration testing in the end-to-end pipeline.

To perform linting and unit testing, you can use automation tools like Azure Pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

#### Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery involves the steps needed to safely deploy a model in production. The first step is to package and deploy the model in *pre-production environments*, such as dev and test environments. Portability of the parameters, hyperparameters, and other model artifacts is an important aspect to maintain as you promote the code through these environments. This portability is especially important when it comes to large language models (LLMs) and stable diffusion models. Once the model passes the unit tests and quality assurance (QA) tests, you can approve it for deployment in the *production environment*.

#### Source control

Source control, or *version control*, is essential for managing changes to code and models. In an ML system, this refers to data versioning, code versioning, and model versioning, which allow cross-functional teams to collaborate effectively and track changes over time. Using a Git-based source control system, like [ Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/repos/#:%7E:text=Overview.%20Free%20private%20Git%20repositories,%20pull%20requests,%20and?msockid=182ea2d5e1ff6eb61ccbb1b8e5ff608a) in Azure DevOps or a

**GitHub repository**, enables you to programmatically maintain a history of changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches for different experiments.

#### Agile planning

Agile planning involves isolating work into *sprints*, which are short time frames for completing specific tasks. This approach allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements to the model. Model training can be an ongoing process, and Agile planning can help scope the project and enable better team alignment.

You can use tools like [ Azure Boards](/en-us/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards) in Azure DevOps or

**GitHub issues**to manage your Agile planning.

#### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

You use infrastructure as code to repeat and automate the infrastructure needed to train, deploy, and serve your models. In an ML system, IaC helps simplify and define the appropriate Azure resources needed for the specific job type in code, and the code is maintained in a repository. This allows you to version control your infrastructure and make changes for resource optimization, cost-effectiveness, etc. as needed.
