# Customize the node configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Customizing your node configuration allows you to adjust operating system (OS) settings or kubelet parameters to match the needs of your workloads. When you create an AKS cluster or add a node pool to your cluster, you can customize a subset of commonly used OS and kubelet settings. To configure settings beyond this subset, you can [use a daemon set to customize your needed configurations without losing AKS support for your nodes](support-policies#shared-responsibility).

## Create custom node configuration files for AKS node pools

OS and kubelet configuration changes require you to create a new configuration file with the parameters and your desired settings. If a value for a parameter isn't specified, then the value is set to the default.

Note

The following examples show common configuration settings. You can modify the settings to meet your workload requirements. For a full list of supported custom configuration parameters, see the [Supported custom configuration parameters](#supported-custom-configuration-parameters) section.

### Kubelet configuration

Create a `linuxkubeletconfig.json`

file with the following contents:

```
{
"cpuManagerPolicy": "static",
"cpuCfsQuota": true,
"cpuCfsQuotaPeriod": "200ms",
"imageGcHighThreshold": 90,
"imageGcLowThreshold": 70,
"topologyManagerPolicy": "best-effort",
"allowedUnsafeSysctls": [
"kernel.msg*",
"net.*"
],
"failSwapOn": false
}
```


### OS configuration

Create a `linuxosconfig.json`

file with the following contents:

```
{
"transparentHugePageEnabled": "madvise",
"transparentHugePageDefrag": "defer+madvise",
"swapFileSizeMB": 1500,
"sysctls": {
"netCoreSomaxconn": 163849,
"netIpv4TcpTwReuse": true,
"netIpv4IpLocalPortRange": "32000 60000"
}
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster using custom configuration files

Note

Keep the following information in mind when using custom configuration files when creating a new AKS cluster:

- If you specify a configuration when creating a cluster, the configuration applies only to the nodes in the initial node pool. Any settings not configured in the JSON file retain their default values.
`CustomLinuxOsConfig`

isn't supported for the Windows OS type.

Create a new cluster using custom configuration files using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and specifying your configuration files for the

`--kubelet-config`

and `--linux-os-config`

parameters. The following example command creates a new cluster with the custom `./linuxkubeletconfig.json`

and `./linuxosconfig.json`

files:```
az aks create --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --kubelet-config ./linuxkubeletconfig.json --linux-os-config ./linuxosconfig.json
```


## Add a node pool using custom configuration files

Note

Keep the following information in mind when using custom configuration files when adding a new node pool to an existing AKS cluster:

- When you add a Linux node pool to an existing cluster, you can specify the kubelet configuration, OS configuration, or both. When you add a Windows node pool to an existing cluster, you can only specify the kubelet configuration. If you specify a configuration when adding a node pool, the configuration applies only to the nodes in the new node pool. Any settings not configured in the JSON file retain their default values.
`CustomKubeletConfig`

is supported for Linux and Windows node pools.

Create a new Linux node pool using the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and specifying your configuration files for the

`--kubelet-config`

and `--linux-os-config`

parameters. The following example command creates a new Linux node pool with the custom `./linuxkubeletconfig.json`

file:```
az aks nodepool add --name <node-pool-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --kubelet-config ./linuxkubeletconfig.json
```


## Confirm settings were applied

After you apply custom node configuration, you can confirm the settings were applied to the nodes by [connecting to the host](node-access) and verifying `sysctl`

or configuration changes were made on the filesystem.

## Supported custom configuration parameters

`--namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"`

.### Windows kubelet custom configuration

| Parameter | Allowed values/interval | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
`imageGcHighThreshold` |
0-100 | 85 | The percent of disk usage after which image garbage collection is always run. Minimum disk usage that triggers garbage collection. To disable image garbage collection, set to 100. |
`imageGcLowThreshold` |
0-100, no higher than `imageGcHighThreshold` |
80 | The percent of disk usage before which image garbage collection is never run. Minimum disk usage that can trigger garbage collection. |
`containerLogMaxSizeMB` |
Size in megabytes (MB) | 10 | The maximum size (for example, 10 MB) of a container log file before it gets rotated. |
`containerLogMaxFiles` |
≥ 2 | 5 | The maximum number of container log files that can be present for a container. |

## Linux custom OS configuration settings

Important

To simplify search and readability, the OS settings are displayed in this article by their name, but they should be added to the configuration JSON file or AKS API using the [camelCase capitalization convention](/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions).

For example, if you modify the `vm.max_map_count setting`

, you should reformat to `vmMaxMapCount`

in the configuration JSON file.

### Linux file handle limits

When serving high amounts of traffic, that traffic commonly comes from a large number of local files. You can adjust the following kernel settings and built-in limits to allow you to handle more, at the cost of some system memory.

The following table lists the file handle limits that you can customize per node pool:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`fs.file-max` |
8192 - 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | Maximum number of file-handles that the Linux kernel allocates. This value is set to the maximum possible value (2^63-1) to prevent file descriptor exhaustion and ensure unlimited system-wide file handles for containerized workloads. |
`fs.inotify.max_user_watches` |
781250 - 2097152 | 1048576 | 1048576 | 1048576 | Maximum number of file watches allowed by the system. Each watch is roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. |
`fs.aio-max-nr` |
65536 - 6553500 | 65536 | 65536 | 65536 | The aio-nr shows the current system-wide number of asynchronous io requests. aio-max-nr allows you to change the maximum value aio-nr can grow to. |
`fs.nr_open` |
8192 - 20000500 | 1048576 | 1048576 | 1073741816 | The maximum number of file-handles a process can allocate. |

Note

The `fs.file-max`

parameter is set to 9223372036854775807 (the maximum value for a signed 64-bit integer) across Ubuntu and Azure Linux based on upstream defaults. This configuration:

**Prevents denial-of-service attacks**based on system-wide file descriptor exhaustion.**Ensures container workloads**are never bottlenecked by system-wide file handle limits.**Maintains security**through per-process limits (`fs.nr_open`

and`ulimit`

) which still apply to individual processes.**Optimizes for container platforms**where many containers might run simultaneously, each potentially opening many files and network connection.

### Linux socket and network tuning

For agent nodes, which are expected to handle large numbers of concurrent sessions, you can use following TCP and network options and adjust them per node pool:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`net.core.somaxconn` |
4096 - 3240000 | 16384 | 16384 | 16384 | Maximum number of connection requests that can be queued for any given listening socket. An upper limit for the value of the backlog parameter passed to the
`somaxconn` , then it's silently truncated to this limit. |

`net.core.netdev_max_backlog`

`net.core.rmem_max`

`net.core.wmem_max`

`net.core.optmem_max`

`net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`

`net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets`

`timewait`

sockets held by system simultaneously. If this number is exceeded, time-wait socket is immediately destroyed and warning is printed.`net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout`

`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`

`keepalive`

messages when `keepalive`

is enabled.`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes`

`keepalive`

probes TCP sends out, until it decides that the connection is broken.`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl`

`tcp_keepalive_probes`

it makes up the time to kill a connection that isn't responding, after probes started.`net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse`

`TIME-WAIT`

sockets for new connections when it's safe from protocol viewpoint.`net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3`

`net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max`

`nf_conntrack`

is a module that tracks connection entries for NAT within Linux. The `nf_conntrack`

module uses a hash table to record the *established connection*record of the TCP protocol.`nf_conntrack_max`

is the maximum number of nodes in the hash table, that is, the maximum number of connections supported by the `nf_conntrack`

module or the size of connection tracking table. **Default value**is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula:`RAM_in_bytes / 16384`

(or `RAM_in_MB * 64`

). For example, a VM with 8 GB RAM has a default of approximately 524,288 connections. Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory.`net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_buckets`

`nf_conntrack`

is a module that tracks connection entries for NAT within Linux. The `nf_conntrack`

module uses a hash table to record the *established connection*record of the TCP protocol.`nf_conntrack_buckets`

is the size of hash table. **Default value**is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula:`RAM_in_bytes / 16384`

, with a minimum of 1,024 buckets and a maximum of 262,144 buckets. The default `nf_conntrack_max`

is typically set to `nf_conntrack_buckets * 4`

. Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory.### Linux worker limits

Like file descriptor limits, the number of workers or threads that a process can create are limited by both a kernel setting and user limits. The user limit on AKS is unlimited. The following table lists the kernel setting that you can customize per node pool:

| Setting | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`kernel.threads-max` |
Dynamically calculated | Dynamically calculated | Dynamically calculated | Processes can spin up worker threads. The maximum number of all threads that can be created is set with the kernel setting `kernel.threads-max` . Default value is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula: `total_ram_pages / 4` (where each page is typically 4 KB). Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory. |

### Linux virtual memory

The following table lists the kernel settings that you can customize per node pool to tune the operation of the virtual memory (VM) subsystem of the Linux kernel and the `writeout`

of dirty data to disk:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`vm.max_map_count` |
65530 | 1048576 | 1048576 | This file contains the maximum number of memory map areas a process can have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of calling `malloc` , directly by `mmap` , `mprotect` , and `madvise` , and also when loading shared libraries. |
|
`vm.vfs_cache_pressure` |
1 - 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory, which is used for caching of directory and inode objects. |
`vm.swappiness` |
0 - 100 | 60 | 60 | 60 | This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps memory pages. Higher values increase aggressiveness, lower values decrease the amount of swap. A value of 0 instructs the kernel not to initiate swap until the amount of free and file-backed pages is less than the high water mark in a zone. |

[Transparent Hugepages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html#admin-guide-transhuge)is a Linux kernel feature intended to improve performance by making more efficient use of your processor's memory-mapping hardware. When enabled the kernel attempts to allocate`hugepages`

whenever possible and any Linux process receives 2-MB pages if the `mmap`

region is 2 MB naturally aligned. In certain cases when `hugepages`

are enabled system wide, applications might end up allocating more memory resources. An application might `mmap`

a large region but only touch 1 byte of it, in that case a 2-MB page might be allocated instead of a 4k page for no good reason. This scenario is why it's possible to disable `hugepages`

system-wide or to only have them inside `MADV_HUGEPAGE madvise`

regions.`transparentHugePageDefrag`

# Use planned maintenance to schedule and control upgrades for your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use planned maintenance to schedule and control cluster and node image upgrades in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Regular maintenance is performed on your AKS cluster automatically. There are two types of maintenance operations:

**AKS-initiated maintenance**involves the weekly releases that AKS performs to keep your cluster up to date with the latest features and fixes.**User-initiated maintenance**includes[cluster auto-upgrades](upgrade-cluster)and[node operating system (OS) automatic security updates](auto-upgrade-node-image).

When you use the feature of planned maintenance in AKS, you can run both types of maintenance in a cadence of your choice to minimize workload impact.

Note

You can use planned maintenance to schedule the timing of automatic upgrades, but enabling or disabling planned maintenance doesn't enable or disable automatic upgrades.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have an AKS cluster, see
[Create an AKS cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli). - If you're using the Azure CLI, upgrade to the latest version using the
command.`az upgrade`


## Considerations

When you use planned maintenance, the following considerations apply:

- AKS reserves the right to break planned maintenance windows for unplanned, reactive maintenance operations that are urgent or critical. These maintenance operations might even run during the
`notAllowedTime`

or`notAllowedDates`

periods defined in your configuration. - Maintenance operations are considered
*best effort only*and aren't guaranteed to occur within a specified window.

## Schedule configuration types for planned maintenance

Three schedule configuration types are available for planned maintenance:

`default`

is a basic configuration for controlling AKS releases, which covers control plane components and system add-ons upgrade. The releases can take up to two weeks to roll out to all regions from the initial time of shipping, because of Azure safe deployment practices.Choose

`default`

to schedule these updates in a manner that's least disruptive for you. You can monitor the status of an ongoing AKS release by region with the[weekly release tracker](release-tracker).`aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

controls when to perform cluster upgrades scheduled by your designated auto-upgrade channel. You can configure more finely controlled cadence and recurrence settings with this configuration compared to the`default`

configuration. For more information on cluster auto-upgrade, see[Automatically upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](upgrade-cluster).`aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

controls when to perform the node OS security patching scheduled by your node OS auto-upgrade channel. You can configure more finely controlled cadence and recurrence settings with this configuration compared to the`default`

configuration. For more information on node OS auto-upgrade channels, see[Automatically patch and update AKS cluster node images](auto-upgrade-node-image).

We recommend using `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

for all cluster Kubernetes version upgrade scenarios and `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

for all node OS security patching scenarios.

The `default`

option is meant exclusively for AKS weekly releases. Use `default`

if you want to control the upgrade schedule for AKS control plane components (such as API Server, ETCD, etc.) and add-ons (such as CoreDNS, Metrics Server, etc.).

All three types of configurations can coexist.

## Create a maintenance window

Note

When you're using auto-upgrade, to ensure proper functionality, use a maintenance window with a duration of four hours or more.

Note

From the 2023-05-01 API version onwards, use the properties in the following table for `default`

configuration.

An `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

or `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

maintenance window and `default`

configuration from 2023-05-01 API version onwards has the following properties:

| Name | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`utcOffset` |
The time zone for cluster maintenance. | `+00:00` |
`startDate` |
The date on which the maintenance window begins to take effect. | The current date at creation time |
`startTime` |
The time for maintenance to begin, based on the time zone determined by `utcOffset` . |
Not applicable |
`schedule` |
The upgrade frequency. Three types are available: `Weekly` , `AbsoluteMonthly` , and `RelativeMonthly` . |
Not applicable |
`intervalDays` |
The interval in days for maintenance runs. It's applicable only to `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule` . |
Not applicable |
`intervalWeeks` |
The interval in weeks for maintenance runs. | Not applicable |
`intervalMonths` |
The interval in months for maintenance runs. | Not applicable |
`dayOfWeek` |
The specified day of the week for maintenance to begin. | Not applicable |
`durationHours` |
The duration of the window for maintenance to run. | Not applicable |
`notAllowedDates` |
A range of dates that maintenance can't run, determined by `start` and `end` child properties. It's applicable only when you're creating the maintenance window by using a configuration file. |
Not applicable |

### Deprecated properties

Note

If you create a `default`

configuration with the following deprecated properties, it migrates automatically to the new properties shown in the previous table.

**[Deprecated]** A `default`

maintenance window has the following legacy properties:

| Name | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`timeInWeek` |
In a `default` configuration, this property contains the `day` and `hourSlots` values that define a maintenance window. |
Not applicable |
`timeInWeek.day` |
The day of the week to perform maintenance in a `default` configuration. |
Not applicable |
`timeInWeek.hourSlots` |
A list of hour-long time slots to perform maintenance on a particular day in a `default` configuration. |
Not applicable |
`notAllowedTime` |
A range of dates that maintenance can't run, determined by `start` and `end` child properties. This property is applicable only when you're creating the maintenance window by using a configuration file. |
Not applicable |

### Schedule types

Four schedule types are supported: `Daily`

, `Weekly`

, `AbsoluteMonthly`

, and `RelativeMonthly`

.

The following table shows which types are available for each maintenance-configuration option:

| Schedule type | `default` |
`aksManagedClusterAutoUpgradeSchedule` |
`aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily | Unsupported ❌ | Supported ✅ (after Jun 2025) | Supported ✅ |
| Weekly | Supported ✅ | Supported ✅ | Supported ✅ |
| AbsoluteMonthly | Unsupported ❌ | Supported ✅ | Supported ✅ |
| RelativeMonthly | Unsupported ❌ | Supported ✅ | Supported ✅ |

All of the fields shown for each schedule type are required.

A `Daily`

schedule might look like "every three days":

```
"schedule": {
"daily": {
"intervalDays": 3
}
}
```


A `Weekly`

schedule might look like "every two weeks on Friday":

```
"schedule": {
"weekly": {
"intervalWeeks": 2,
"dayOfWeek": "Friday"
}
}
```


An `AbsoluteMonthly`

schedule might look like "every three months on the first day of the month":

```
"schedule": {
"absoluteMonthly": {
"intervalMonths": 3,
"dayOfMonth": 1
}
}
```


A `RelativeMonthly`

schedule might look like "every two months on the last Monday":

```
"schedule": {
"relativeMonthly": {
"intervalMonths": 2,
"dayOfWeek": "Monday",
"weekIndex": "Last"
}
}
```


Valid values for `weekIndex`

include `First`

, `Second`

, `Third`

, `Fourth`

, and `Last`

.

## Add a maintenance window configuration

Add a maintenance window configuration to an AKS cluster using the [ az aks maintenanceconfiguration add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/maintenanceconfiguration#az-aks-maintenanceconfiguration-add) command.

The first example adds a new `default`

configuration that schedules maintenance to run from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM every Monday in the `UTC`

time zone. The second example adds a new `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

configuration that schedules maintenance to run every third Friday between 12:00 AM and 8:00 AM in the `UTC+5:30`

time zone.

```
# Add a new default configuration
az aks maintenanceconfiguration add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name default --schedule-type Weekly --day-of-week Monday --interval-weeks 1 --duration 4 --utc-offset +00:00 --start-time 01:00
# Add a new aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule configuration
az aks maintenanceconfiguration add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule --schedule-type Weekly --day-of-week Friday --interval-weeks 3 --duration 8 --utc-offset +05:30 --start-time 00:00
```


## Update an existing maintenance window

Update an existing maintenance configuration using the [ az aks maintenanceconfiguration update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/maintenanceconfiguration#az-aks-maintenanceconfiguration-update) command.

The following example updates the `default`

configuration to schedule maintenance to run from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM every Friday:

```
az aks maintenanceconfiguration update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name default --schedule-type Weekly --day-of-week Friday --interval-weeks 1 --duration 4 --utc-offset +00:00 --start-time 02:00
```


## List all maintenance windows in an existing cluster

List the current maintenance configuration windows in your AKS cluster using the [ az aks maintenanceconfiguration list](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/maintenanceconfiguration#az-aks-maintenanceconfiguration-list) command:

```
az aks maintenanceconfiguration list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME
```


## Show a specific maintenance configuration window in an existing cluster

View a specific maintenance configuration window in your AKS cluster using the [ az aks maintenanceconfiguration show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/maintenanceconfiguration#az-aks-maintenanceconfiguration-show) command with the

`--name`

parameter:```
az aks maintenanceconfiguration show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule
```


The following example output shows the maintenance window for `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster/maintenanceConfigurations/aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule",
"maintenanceWindow": {
"durationHours": 4,
"notAllowedDates": [
{
"end": "2024-01-05",
"start": "2023-12-23"
}
],
"schedule": {
"absoluteMonthly": {
"dayOfMonth": 1,
"intervalMonths": 3
},
"daily": null,
"relativeMonthly": null,
"weekly": null
},
"startDate": "2023-01-20",
"startTime": "09:00",
"utcOffset": "-08:00"
},
"name": "aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule",
"notAllowedTime": null,
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
"systemData": null,
"timeInWeek": null,
"type": null
}
```


## Delete a maintenance configuration window in an existing cluster

Delete a maintenance configuration window in your AKS cluster using the [ az aks maintenanceconfiguration delete](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/maintenanceconfiguration#az-aks-maintenanceconfiguration-delete) command.

The following example deletes the `autoUpgradeSchedule`

maintenance configuration:

```
az aks maintenanceconfiguration delete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --name autoUpgradeSchedule
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### How can I check the existing maintenance configurations in my cluster?

Use the `az aks maintenanceconfiguration show`

command.

### Can reactive, unplanned maintenance happen during the `notAllowedDates`

periods too?

Yes. AKS reserves the right to break these windows for unplanned, reactive maintenance operations that are urgent or critical.

### How can I tell if a maintenance event occurred?

For releases, check your cluster's region and look up information in [weekly releases](release-tracker) to see if it matches your maintenance schedule. To view the status of your automatic upgrades, look up [activity logs](monitor-aks-reference) on your cluster. You can also look up specific upgrade-related events, as mentioned in [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster).

AKS also emits upgrade-related Azure Event Grid events. To learn more, see [AKS as an Event Grid source](quickstart-event-grid).

### Can I use more than one maintenance configuration at the same time?

Yes, you can run all three configurations simultaneously: `default`

, `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

, and `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

. If the windows overlap, AKS decides the running order.

### I configured a maintenance window, but the upgrade didn't happen. Why?

AKS auto-upgrade needs a certain amount of time, usually not more than 15 minutes, to take the maintenance window into consideration. We recommend at least 15 minutes between the creation or update of a maintenance configuration and the scheduled start time.

Also, ensure that your cluster is started when the planned maintenance window starts. If the cluster is stopped, its control plane is deallocated and no operations can be performed.

### Why was one of my agent pools upgraded outside the maintenance window?

If an agent pool isn't upgraded (for example, because pod disruption budgets prevented it), it might be upgraded later, outside the maintenance window. This scenario is referred to as a *catch-up upgrade*. It avoids letting agent pools be upgraded with a different version from the AKS control plane.

Another reason why an agent pool could be upgraded unexpectedly is when there's no defined maintenance configuration or if it was deleted. In that case, a cluster with auto-upgrade *but without a maintenance configuration* is upgraded at random times (*fallback schedule*), which might be an undesired timeframe.

### Are there any best practices for the maintenance configurations?

We recommend setting the [node OS security updates](auto-upgrade-node-image) schedule to a weekly cadence if you're using the `NodeImage`

channel, because a new node image is shipped every week. You can also opt in for the `SecurityPatch`

channel to receive daily security updates.

You can set the [auto-upgrade](auto-upgrade-cluster) schedule to a monthly cadence to stay current with the Kubernetes N-2 [support policy](support-policies).

For a detailed discussion of upgrade best practices and other considerations, see [AKS patch and upgrade guidance](/en-us/azure/architecture/operator-guides/aks/aks-upgrade-practices).

### Can I configure all my clusters in a single subscription to use the same maintenance configuration?

We don't recommend using the same maintenance configuration for multiple clusters in a single subscription, as doing so can lead to ARM throttling errors causing cluster upgrades to fail. Instead, we recommend staggering the maintenance windows for each cluster to avoid these errors.

### Why did my node pools get upgraded twice during the same maintenance window?

If a newer version of the node image becomes available during the maintenance window, AKS performs a second upgrade to ensure that your node pools are running the latest version. This behavior is normal and doesn't indicate an issue.
