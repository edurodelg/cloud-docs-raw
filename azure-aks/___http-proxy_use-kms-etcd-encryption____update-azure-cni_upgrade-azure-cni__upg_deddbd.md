# HTTP proxy support in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to configure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to use an HTTP proxy for outbound internet access.

AKS clusters deployed into managed or custom virtual networks have certain outbound dependencies that are necessary to function properly, which created problems in environments requiring internet access to be routed through HTTP proxies. Nodes had no way of bootstrapping the configuration, environment variables, and certificates necessary to access internet services.

The HTTP proxy feature adds HTTP proxy support to AKS clusters, exposing a straightforward interface that you can use to secure AKS-required network traffic in proxy-dependent environments. With this feature, both AKS nodes and pods are configured to use the HTTP proxy. The feature also enables installation of a trusted certificate authority onto the nodes as part of bootstrapping a cluster. More complex solutions might require creating a chain of trust to establish secure communications across the network.

## Limitations and considerations

The following scenarios are **not** supported:

- Different proxy configurations per node pool
- User/Password authentication
- Custom certificate authorities (CAs) for API server communication
- AKS clusters with Windows node pools
- Node pools using Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS)
- Using * as wildcard attached to a domain suffix for noProxy

`httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, and `trustedCa`

have no value by default. Pods are injected with the following environment variables:

`HTTP_PROXY`

`http_proxy`

`HTTPS_PROXY`

`https_proxy`

`NO_PROXY`

`no_proxy`


To disable the injection of the proxy environment variables, you need to annotate the Pod with `"kubernetes.azure.com/no-http-proxy-vars":"true"`

.

## Before you begin

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a configuration file with HTTP proxy values

Create a file and provide values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, and `noProxy`

. If your environment requires it, provide a value for `trustedCa`

.

The schema for the config file looks like this:

```
{
"httpProxy": "string",
"httpsProxy": "string",
"noProxy": [
"string"
],
"trustedCa": "string"
}
```


Review requirements for each parameter:

`httpProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be`http`

.`httpsProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If not specified, then`httpProxy`

is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.`noProxy`

: A list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.`trustedCa`

: A string containing the`base64 encoded`

alternative CA certificate content. Currently only the`PEM`

format is supported.

Important

For compatibility with Go-based components that are part of the Kubernetes system, the certificate **must** support `Subject Alternative Names(SANs)`

instead of the deprecated Common Name certs.

There are differences in applications on how to comply with the environment variable `http_proxy`

, `https_proxy`

, and `no_proxy`

. Curl and Python don't support CIDR in `no_proxy`

, but Ruby does.

Example input:

```
{
"httpProxy": "http://myproxy.server.com:8080",
"httpsProxy": "https://myproxy.server.com:8080",
"noProxy": [
"localhost",
"127.0.0.1"
],
"trustedCA": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUgvVENDQmVXZ0F3SUJB...S0tLS0="
}
```


## Create a cluster with an HTTP proxy configuration using the Azure CLI

You can configure an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy configuration during cluster creation.

Use the

command and pass in your configuration as a JSON file.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --name $clusterName \ --resource-group $resourceGroup \ --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config.json \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Your cluster should initialize with the HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.

Verify the HTTP proxy configuration is on the pods and nodes by checking that the environment variables contain the appropriate values for

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

using the`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables are set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


## Update an HTTP proxy configuration

You can update HTTP proxy configurations on existing clusters, including:

- Updating an existing cluster to enable HTTP proxy and adding a new HTTP proxy configuration.
- Updating an existing cluster to change an HTTP proxy configuration.

### HTTP proxy update considerations

The `--http-proxy-config`

parameter should be set to a new JSON file with updated values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, `noProxy`

, and `trustedCa`

if necessary. The update injects new environment variables into pods with the new `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

, or `noProxy`

values. Pods must be rotated for the apps to pick it up, because the environment variable values are injected by a mutating admission webhook.

Note

If switching to a new proxy, the new proxy must already exist for the update to be successful. After the upgrade is completed, you can delete the old proxy.

### Update a cluster to update or enable HTTP proxy

Enable or update HTTP proxy configurations on an existing cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

For example, let's say you created a new file with the base64 encoded string of the new CA cert called

*aks-proxy-config-2.json*. You can update the proxy configuration on your cluster with the following command:`az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config-2.json`


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Verify the HTTP proxy configuration is on the pods and nodes by checking that the environment variables contain the appropriate values for

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

using the`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables are set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


## Disable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster (Preview)

### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Disable HTTP Proxy requires a minimum of 18.0.0b13**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register `DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name DisableHTTPProxyPreview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Update cluster to disable HTTP proxy (preview)

Update your cluster to disable HTTP proxy using the

command with`az aks update`

`--disable-http-proxy`

flag.`az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --disable-http-proxy`


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Verify HTTP proxy is disabled by validating the HTTP proxy configuration isn't set on the pods and nodes using the

`kubectl describe pod`

command.`kubectl describe {any pod} -n kube-system`

To validate proxy variables aren't set in pods, you can check the environment variables present on the nodes.

`kubectl get nodes kubectl node-shell {node name} cat /etc/environment`


### Re-enable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster

When you create a cluster, HTTP proxy is enabled by default. Once you disable HTTP proxy on a cluster, the proxy configuration is saved in the database but the proxy variables are removed from the pods and nodes.

To re-enable HTTP proxy on an existing cluster, use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--enable-http-proxy`

flag.```
az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --enable-http-proxy
```


Caution

AKS automatically reimages all node pools in the cluster when you update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. You can use

[Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](operator-best-practices-scheduler)to safeguard disruption to critical pods during reimage.

Important

If you had an HTTP proxy configuration on your cluster before disabling, the existing HTTP proxy configuration automatically applies when you re-enable HTTP proxy on that cluster. We recommend verifying the configuration to ensure it meets your current requirements before proceeding. If you want to change your HTTP proxy configuration after re-enabling HTTP proxy, follow the steps to [Update the HTTP proxy configuration on an existing cluster](#update-a-cluster-to-update-or-enable-http-proxy).

## Configure an HTTP proxy configuration using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

You can deploy an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy using an ARM template.

Review requirements for each parameter:

`httpProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be`http`

.`httpsProxy`

: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If not specified, then`httpProxy`

is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.`noProxy`

: A list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.`trustedCa`

: A string containing the`base64 encoded`

alternative CA certificate content. Currently only the`PEM`

format is supported.

Important

For compatibility with Go-based components that are part of the Kubernetes system, the certificate

**must**support`Subject Alternative Names (SANs)`

instead of the deprecated Common Name certs.There are differences in applications on how to comply with the environment variable

`http_proxy`

,`https_proxy`

, and`no_proxy`

. Curl and Python don't support CIDR in`no_proxy`

, but Ruby does.Create a template with HTTP proxy parameters. In your template, provide values for

`httpProxy`

,`httpsProxy`

, and`noProxy`

. If necessary, provide a value for`trustedCa`

. The same schema used for CLI deployment exists in the`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

definition under`"properties"`

, as shown in the following example:`"properties": { ..., "httpProxyConfig": { "enabled": "true", "httpProxy": "string", "httpsProxy": "string", "noProxy": [ "string" ], "trustedCa": "string" } }`

Deploy your ARM template with the HTTP Proxy configuration. Your cluster should initialize with your HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.


## Update an HTTP proxy configuration

You can update HTTP proxy configurations on existing clusters, including:

- Updating an existing cluster to enable HTTP proxy and adding a new HTTP proxy configuration.
- Updating an existing cluster to change an HTTP proxy configuration.

### HTTP proxy update considerations

The `--http-proxy-config`

parameter should be set to a new JSON file with updated values for `httpProxy`

, `httpsProxy`

values. Pods must be rotated for the apps to pick it up, because the environment variable values are injected by a mutating admission webhook.

Note

If switching to a new proxy, the new proxy must already exist for the update to be successful. After the upgrade is completed, you can delete the old proxy.

### Update an ARM template to configure HTTP proxy

In your template, provide new values for

`httpProxy`

,`httpsProxy`

, and`noProxy`

. If necessary, provide a value for`trustedCa`

.The same schema used for CLI deployment exists in the

`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

definition under`"properties"`

, as shown in the following example:`"properties": { ..., "httpProxyConfig": { "enabled": "true", "httpProxy": "string", "httpsProxy": "string", "noProxy": [ "string" ], "trustedCa": "string" } }`

Deploy your ARM template with the updated HTTP Proxy configuration.

If you want to re-enable HTTP proxy, follow the steps to [Update an HTTP proxy configuration using an ARM template](#update-an-arm-template-to-configure-http-proxy).

## Istio add-on HTTP proxy for External Services

If you're using the [Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS](istio-about), you must create a Service Entry to enable your applications in the mesh to access noncluster or external resources via the HTTP proxy.

For example:

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
name: proxy
spec:
hosts:
- my-company-proxy.com # ignored
addresses:
- $PROXY_IP/32
ports:
- number: $PROXY_PORT
name: tcp
protocol: TCP
location: MESH_EXTERNAL
```


Create a file and provide values for

`PROXY_IP`

and`PROXY_PORT`

.You can deploy the Service Entry using:

`kubectl apply -f service_proxy.yaml`


## Monitoring add-on configuration

HTTP proxy with the monitoring add-on supports the following configurations:

- Outbound proxy without authentication
- Outbound proxy with trusted cert for Log Analytics endpoint

The following configuration isn't supported:

- Custom Metrics and Recommended Alerts features when using a proxy with trusted certificates

# Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

This article describes the legacy KMS experience for AKS. For new clusters running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later, we recommend using the new [KMS data encryption](kms-data-encryption) experience, which offers platform-managed keys, customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation, and a simplified configuration experience.

For conceptual information about data encryption options, see [Data encryption at rest concepts for AKS](kms-data-encryption-concepts).

This article shows you how to turn on encryption at rest for a public or private key vault using Azure Key Vault and the Key Management Service (KMS) plugin on AKS. You can use the KMS plugin to:

- Use a key in a key vault for etcd encryption.
- Bring your own keys.
- Provide encryption at rest for secrets stored in etcd.
- Rotate the keys in a key vault.

For more information on using KMS, see [Using a KMS provider for data encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.39.0 or later. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Warning

Starting on September 15, 2024, Konnectivity is no longer supported for private key vaults for new subscriptions or subscriptions that didn't previously use this configuration. For subscriptions currently using this configuration or used it in the past 60 days, support continues until AKS version 1.30 reaches end of life for community support.

KMS supports Konnectivity or [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for public key vaults.

KMS supports [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for both private and public key vaults.

You can use `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`

to verify the results and show that a `konnectivity-agent`

pod is running. If a pod is running, the AKS cluster is using Konnectivity. When you use API Server VNet Integration, you can run the `az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

command to verify that the `enableVnetIntegration`

setting is set to `true`

.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate KMS etcd encryption with AKS:

- Deleting the key, the key vault, or the associated identity isn't supported.
- KMS etcd encryption doesn't work with system-assigned managed identity. The key vault access policy must be set before the feature is turned on. System-assigned managed identity isn't available until after the cluster is created. Consider the cycle dependency.
- Because the firewall blocks traffic from the KMS plugin to Key Vault, two scenarios aren't supported. First, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with the firewall option
*Allow public access from specific virtual networks and IP addresses*. Second, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with*Disable public access*unless[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)is enabled. - The maximum number of secrets supported by a cluster with KMS turned on is
*2,000*. However, it's important to note that[KMS v2](use-kms-v2)isn't limited by this restriction and can handle a higher number of secrets. - Bring your own (BYO) Azure key vault from another tenant isn't supported.
- With KMS turned on, you can't change the associated key vault mode (public versus private). To
[update a key vault mode](update-kms-key-vault), you must first turn off KMS, and then turn it on again. - If a cluster has KMS turned on and has a private key vault, it must use the
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)tunnel. Konnectivity isn't supported. - Using the Virtual Machine Scale Sets API to scale the nodes in the cluster down to zero deallocates the nodes. The cluster then goes down and becomes unrecoverable.
- After you turn off KMS, you can't delete or expire the keys. Such behaviors would cause the API server to stop working.
- For a private cluster with KMS enabled and virtual network integration that uses a private key vault, the network security group (NSG) must allow TCP port 443 from the API server to the private key vault's private endpoint IP address. This limitation needs to be considered when using other rules in the API subnet NSG or cluster subnet NSG.

## Create a key vault and key for a public key vault

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault. You can use a public key vault with or without Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Warning

Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable.

If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see [Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a key vault with Azure RBAC using the

command. This example command also exports the key vault resource ID to an environment variable.`az keyvault create`

`export KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --enable-rbac-authorization true --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself permissions to create a key using the

command. This example assigns the Key Vault Crypto Officer role to the signed-in user.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) --assignee-principal-type "User" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`

Get the key ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az keyvault key show`

`export KEY_ID=$(az keyvault key show --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT --query 'key.kid' -o tsv) echo $KEY_ID`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a public key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a public key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a public key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a public key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a public key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a public key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable a public key vault and KMS on an existing AKS cluster

Enable KMS on a public key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Rotate existing keys in a public key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the public key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

KMS uses two keys at the same time. After the first key rotation, you need to ensure both the old and new keys are valid (not expired) until the next key rotation. After the second key rotation, the oldest key can be safely removed/expired.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Create a key vault and key for a private key vault

If you turn on KMS for a private key vault, AKS automatically creates a private endpoint and a private link in the node resource group. The key vault has a private endpoint connection with the AKS cluster.

Warning

Keep the following information in mind when using a private key vault:

- KMS only supports
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)for private key vault. - Creating or updating keys in a private key vault that doesn't have a private endpoint isn't supported. To learn how to manage private key vaults, see
[Integrate a key vault by using Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/private-link-service). - Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable. If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see
[Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a private key vault using the

command with the`az keyvault create`

`--public-network-access Disabled`

parameter.`az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --public-network-access Disabled`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a private key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a private key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a private key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a private key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a private key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to create a private link

For private key vaults, the Key Vault Contributor role is required to create a private link between the private key vault and the cluster.

Assign the Key Vault Contributor role using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Contributor" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a private key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a private key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update an existing AKS cluster to turn on KMS etcd encryption for a private key vault

Enable KMS on a private key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


### Rotate existing keys in a private key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the private key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

After you rotate the key, the previous key (key1) is still cached and shouldn't be deleted. If you want to delete the previous key (key1) immediately, you need to rotate the key twice. Then key2 and key3 are cached, and key1 can be deleted without affecting the existing cluster.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys in a private key vault using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Disable KMS on an AKS cluster

Before you turn off KMS, verify that KMS is enabled on the cluster using the

command.`az aks list`

`az aks list --query "[].{Name:name, KmsEnabled:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.enabled, KeyId:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId}" -o table`

Once confirmed, you can disable KMS using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

parameter.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`

# Update Azure CNI IPAM mode and data plane technology for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters inevitably need an update to newer IP assignment management (IPAM) modes and data plane technologies to access the latest features and supportability. This article provides guidance on updating an existing AKS cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay for the IPAM mode and Azure CNI Powered by Cilium as the data plane.

## Update the IPAM mode to Azure CNI Overlay

Updating an existing cluster to Azure CNI Overlay is an irreversible process.

You can update an existing AKS cluster to Azure CNI Overlay if the cluster:

- Is on Kubernetes version 1.27 or later.
- Doesn't use the
[dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)feature. - Doesn't have network policies enabled. If you need to uninstall the network policy engine before updating your cluster, follow the steps in
[Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico). - Doesn't use any Windows node pools with Docker as the container runtime.

Before Windows OS build 20348.1668, there was a limitation around Windows overlay pods incorrectly routing packets from host network pods via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). This limitation had a detrimental effect for clusters that were updating to Azure CNI Overlay. To avoid this issue, use Windows OS build 20348.1668 or later.

Warning

If you're using a custom

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

configuration to include additional IP ranges that shouldn't send SNAT packets from pods, updating to Azure CNI Overlay can break connectivity to these ranges. Pod IPs from the overlay space are unreachable by anything outside the cluster nodes.For old clusters, a ConfigMap might be left over from a previous version of

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

. If this ConfigMap (named`azure-ip-masq-agent-config`

) exists and isn't intentionally in place, you should delete it before updating.If you're not using a custom

`ip-masq-agent`

configuration, only the`azure-ip-masq-agent-config-reconciled`

ConfigMap should exist with respect to Azure`ip-masq-agent`

ConfigMap. It's updated automatically during the update process.

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately to Azure CNI Overlay isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or Kubernetes version upgrade where each node in a node pool is reimaged.

Update an existing Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16
```


The `--pod-cidr`

parameter is required when you update from legacy CNI plugins because the pods need to get IPs from a new overlay space. The new overlay space doesn't overlap with the existing Azure CNI Node Subnet plugin.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

Warning

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium begins enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

To perform the update, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-dataplane cilium
```

# Upgrade node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to upgrade a single node pool and how to upgrade the cluster control plane for multiple node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Note

As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same Kubernetes version. The default behavior of [`az aks upgrade`

][az-aks-upgrade] is to upgrade all node pools together with the control plane to achieve this alignment. The ability to upgrade individual node pools lets you perform a rolling upgrade and schedule pods between node pools to maintain application uptime.

## Upgrade a single node pool

Note

The node pool operating system (OS) image version is tied to the Kubernetes version of the cluster. You only get OS image upgrades following a cluster upgrade.

Check for any available upgrades using the [

`az aks get-upgrades`

][az-aks-get-upgrades] command.`az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

Upgrade a specific node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --kubernetes-version <kubernetes-version> \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Upgrading*state:`[ { ... "count": 3, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "<kubernetes-version>", ... "provisioningState": "Upgrading", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "<kubernetes-version-2>", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes to upgrade the nodes to the specified version. After the upgrade is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Upgrade a cluster control plane with multiple node pools

An AKS cluster has two cluster resource objects with Kubernetes versions associated to them: the cluster control plane Kubernetes version and a node pool with a Kubernetes version.

### Upgrade behavior for the control plane and node pools

The control plane maps to one or many node pools. The behavior of an upgrade operation depends on which Azure CLI command you use and the flags you specify:

upgrades the control plane and all node pools in the cluster to the same Kubernetes version.`az aks upgrade`

with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag upgrades only the cluster control plane and leaves all node pools unchanged.upgrades only the target node pool with the specified Kubernetes version.`az aks nodepool upgrade`


### Validation rules for upgrades

Note

Kubernetes uses the standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme. The version number is expressed as *x.y.z*, where *x* is the major version, *y* is the minor version, and *z* is the patch version. For example, in version *1.12.6*, *1* is the major version, *12* is the minor version, and *6* is the patch version. The Kubernetes version of the control plane and the initial node pool are set during cluster creation. Other node pools have their Kubernetes version set when they are added to the cluster. The Kubernetes versions may differ between node pools and between a node pool and the control plane.

Kubernetes upgrades for a cluster control plane and node pools are validated using the following sets of rules:

**Rules for valid versions to upgrade node pools**:- The node pool version must have the same
*major*version as the control plane. - The node pool
*minor*version must be within two*minor*versions of the control plane version. - The node pool version can't be greater than the control
`major.minor.patch`

version.

- The node pool version must have the same
**Rules for submitting an upgrade operation**:- You can't downgrade the control plane or a node pool Kubernetes version.
- If a node pool Kubernetes version isn't specified, the behavior depends on the client. In Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, declaration falls back to the existing version defined for the node pool. If nothing is set, it falls back to the control plane version.
- You can't simultaneously submit multiple operations on a single control plane or node pool resource. You can either upgrade or scale a control plane or a node pool at a given time.

# Stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes.

## Overview

To stay within a supported Kubernetes version, you have to upgrade your cluster at least once per year and prepare for all possible disruptions. These disruptions include ones caused by API breaking changes, deprecations, and dependencies such as Helm and Container Storage Interface (CSI). It can be difficult to anticipate these disruptions and migrate critical workloads without experiencing any downtime.

You can configure your AKS cluster to automatically stop upgrade operations consisting of a minor version change with deprecated APIs and alert you to the issue. This feature helps you avoid unexpected disruptions and gives you time to address the deprecated APIs before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- The upgrade operation is a Kubernetes minor version change for the cluster control plane.
- The Kubernetes version you're upgrading to is 1.26 or later.
- The last seen usage of deprecated APIs for the targeted version you're upgrading to must occur within 12 hours before the upgrade operation. AKS records usage hourly, so any usage of deprecated APIs within one hour isn't guaranteed to appear in the detection.

## Mitigate stopped upgrade operations

If you meet the [prerequisites](#before-you-begin), attempt an upgrade, and receive an error message similar to the following example error message:

```
Bad Request({
"code": "ValidationError",
"message": "Control Plane upgrade is blocked due to recent usage of a Kubernetes API deprecated in the specified version. Please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide to migrate the usage. To bypass this error, set enable-force-upgrade in upgradeSettings.overrideSettings. Bypassing this error without migrating usage will result in the deprecated Kubernetes API calls failing. Usage details: 1 error occurred:\n\t* usage has been detected on API flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io.prioritylevelconfigurations.v1beta1, and was recently seen at: 2023-03-23 20:57:18 +0000 UTC, which will be removed in 1.26\n\n",
"subcode": "UpgradeBlockedOnDeprecatedAPIUsage"
})
```


You have two options to mitigate the issue: you can [remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)](#remove-usage-of-deprecated-apis-recommended) or [bypass validation to ignore API changes](#bypass-validation-to-ignore-api-changes).

### Remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)

In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster resource and select

**Diagnose and solve problems**Select

**Create, Upgrade, Delete, and Scale**>**Kubernetes API deprecations**.Wait 12 hours from the time the last deprecated API usage was seen. Read-Only verbs are excluded from the deprecated api usage namely

[Get/List/Watch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/).(You can also check past API usage by enabling[Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query#resource-logs)and exploring kube audit logs.)Retry your cluster upgrade.


### Bypass validation to ignore API changes

Note

This method requires you to use the Azure CLI version 2.57 or later. If you have the preview CLI extension installed, you need to update to version `3.0.0b10`

or later. This method isn't recommended, as deprecated APIs in the targeted Kubernetes version might not work long term. We recommend removing them as soon as possible after the upgrade completes.

Bypass validation to ignore API breaking changes and invoke an upgrade. Specify the

`enable-force-upgrade`

flag and set the`upgrade-override-until`

property to define the end of the window during which validation is bypassed. If no value is set, it defaults the window to three days from the current time. The date and time you specify must be in the future.`az aks upgrade --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --kubernetes-version $KUBERNETES_VERSION --enable-force-upgrade --upgrade-override-until 2023-10-01T13:00:00Z`

Note

`Z`

is the zone designator for the zero UTC/GMT offset, also known as 'Zulu' time. This example sets the end of the window to`13:00:00`

GMT. For more information, see[Combined date and time representations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).

# What is container network metrics?

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Advanced Container Networking Services in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) facilitates the collection of comprehensive container network metrics to give you valuable insights into the performance of your containerized environment. The capability continuously captures essential metrics at the node level and pod level, including traffic volume, dropped packets, connection states, and Domain Name System (DNS) resolution times for effective monitoring and optimizing network performance.

Capturing these metrics is essential for understanding how containers communicate, how traffic flows between services, and where bottlenecks or disruptions might occur. Advanced Container Networking Services integrates seamlessly with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to give you a complete view of networking metrics. Use the metrics for in-depth troubleshooting, network optimization, and performance tuning.

In a cloud-native world, maintaining a healthy and efficient network in a dynamic containerized environment is vital to ensuring that applications perform as expected. Without proper visibility into network traffic and its patterns, identifying potential issues or inefficiencies becomes challenging.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

**Azure managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana**: Azure manages the infrastructure and maintenance, so you can focus on configuring metrics and visualizing metrics.**Bring your own (BYO) Prometheus and Grafana**: You deploy and configure your own instances of Prometheus and Grafana, and you manage the underlying infrastructure.


## Metrics captured

### Node-level metrics

Understanding the health of your container network at the node-level is crucial for maintaining optimal application performance. These metrics provide insights into traffic volume, dropped packets, number of connections, and other data by node. The metrics are stored in Prometheus format, so, you can view them in Grafana.

The following metrics are aggregated per node. All metrics include one of these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)

For Cilium data plane scenarios, Container Network Observability provides metrics only for Linux. Windows is currently not supported. Cilium exposes several metrics including the following used by Container Network Observability.

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
cilium_forward_count_total |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_forward_bytes_total |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_drop_count_total |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_drop_bytes_total |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |

### Pod-level metrics (Hubble metrics)

These Prometheus metrics include source and destination pod information so that you can pinpoint network-related issues at a granular level. Metrics cover information like traffic volume, dropped packets, TCP resets, and Layer 4/Layer 7 packet flows. DNS metrics like DNS errors and DNS requests missing responses are collected by default for non-Cilium data planes. For Cilium data planes, a Cilium FQDN network policy is required to collect DNS metrics, or customers can also troubleshoot DNS using Hubble CLI and observing real-time logs.

The following table describes the metrics that are aggregated per pod (node information is preserved).

All metrics include labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)`source`

or`destination`

For

*outgoing traffic*, a`source`

label that indicates the source pod namespace and name is applied.For

*incoming traffic*, a`destination`

label that indicates the destination pod namespace and name is applied.


| Metric name | Description | Extra Labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
hubble_dns_queries_total |
Total DNS requests by query | `source` or `destination` , `query` , `qtypes` (query type) |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_dns_responses_total |
Total DNS responses by query/response | `source` or `destination` , `query` , `qtypes` (query type), `rcode` (return code), `ips_returned` (number of IPs) |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_drop_total |
Total dropped packet count | `source` or `destination` , `protocol` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_tcp_flags_total |
Total TCP packets count by flag | `source` or `destination` , `flag` |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_flows_processed_total |
Total network flows processed (Layer 4/Layer 7 traffic) | `source` or `destination` , `protocol` , `verdict` , `type` , `subtype` |
✅ | ❌ |

## Container network metrics filtering (Preview)

Now that you have the ability to collect comprehensive metrics at both node and pod levels, you might find yourself dealing with a significant volume of data. To help reduce noise and optimize storage costs, Container Network Observability introduces **container network metrics filtering**. This feature enables you to filter metrics at the source before they are collected and stored, giving you control over which metrics are most relevant to your specific monitoring and troubleshooting needs. This feature is only available for Cilium clusters.

Container network metrics filtering is particularly valuable in large-scale production environments where the sheer volume of metrics can impact storage costs and query performance. By filtering out unnecessary metrics early in the collection process, you can focus on the data that matters most to your operations while maintaining the visibility you need for effective network monitoring.

The filtering capability supports multiple dimensions including namespace-based filtering to focus on specific applications, pod and label-based filtering for targeted monitoring, and metric-specific filtering to collect only the types of metrics that are essential for your use case. This flexibility allows you to strike the right balance between comprehensive observability and cost-effective operations.

To learn more on how to enable container network metrics filtering, see [How to Configure Container Network Metrics Filtering ](how-to-configure-container-network-metrics-filtering).

### Limitations

- Pod-level metrics are available only on Linux.
- Cilium data plane is supported starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
- Metric labels have subtle differences between Cilium and non-Cilium clusters.
- For Cilium based clusters, DNS metrics are only available for pods that have Cilium Network policies (CNP) configured on their clusters, or customers can also troubleshoot DNS using Hubble CLI and observing real-time logs.
- Flow logs are not currently available in the air gapped cloud.
- Hubble relay may crash if one of the Hubble node agents goes down and may cause interruptions to Hubble CLI.
- When using Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) on non-Cilium data planes, FIPS support isn't available on Ubuntu 20.04 nodes due to kernel restrictions. To enable FIPS in this scenario, you must use an Azure Linux node pool. This limitation is expected to be resolved with the release of Ubuntu 22 FIPS. For updates, see the
[AKS issue tracker](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4857). - Container network metrics filtering is only available for Cilium Clusters.

Refer to the FIPS support matrix below:

| Operating System | FIPS Support |
|---|---|
| Azure Linux 3.0 | Yes |
| Azure Linux 2.0 | Yes |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | No |

This limitation does not apply when ACNS is running on Cilium data planes.

### Scale

The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor and Azure Managed Grafana impose service-specific scale limitations. For more information, see [Scrape Prometheus metrics at scale in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-scale).

## Pricing

Important

Advanced Container Networking Services is a paid offering.

For more information about pricing, see [Advanced Container Networking Services - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-container-networking-services/).

# Update Azure CNI IPAM mode and data plane technology for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters inevitably need an update to newer IP assignment management (IPAM) modes and data plane technologies to access the latest features and supportability. This article provides guidance on updating an existing AKS cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay for the IPAM mode and Azure CNI Powered by Cilium as the data plane.

## Update the IPAM mode to Azure CNI Overlay

Updating an existing cluster to Azure CNI Overlay is an irreversible process.

You can update an existing AKS cluster to Azure CNI Overlay if the cluster:

- Is on Kubernetes version 1.27 or later.
- Doesn't use the
[dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)feature. - Doesn't have network policies enabled. If you need to uninstall the network policy engine before updating your cluster, follow the steps in
[Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico). - Doesn't use any Windows node pools with Docker as the container runtime.

Before Windows OS build 20348.1668, there was a limitation around Windows overlay pods incorrectly routing packets from host network pods via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). This limitation had a detrimental effect for clusters that were updating to Azure CNI Overlay. To avoid this issue, use Windows OS build 20348.1668 or later.

Warning

If you're using a custom

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

configuration to include additional IP ranges that shouldn't send SNAT packets from pods, updating to Azure CNI Overlay can break connectivity to these ranges. Pod IPs from the overlay space are unreachable by anything outside the cluster nodes.For old clusters, a ConfigMap might be left over from a previous version of

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

. If this ConfigMap (named`azure-ip-masq-agent-config`

) exists and isn't intentionally in place, you should delete it before updating.If you're not using a custom

`ip-masq-agent`

configuration, only the`azure-ip-masq-agent-config-reconciled`

ConfigMap should exist with respect to Azure`ip-masq-agent`

ConfigMap. It's updated automatically during the update process.

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately to Azure CNI Overlay isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or Kubernetes version upgrade where each node in a node pool is reimaged.

Update an existing Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16
```


The `--pod-cidr`

parameter is required when you update from legacy CNI plugins because the pods need to get IPs from a new overlay space. The new overlay space doesn't overlap with the existing Azure CNI Node Subnet plugin.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

Warning

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium begins enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

To perform the update, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-dataplane cilium
```

# Bring your own CNI plugin with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes doesn't provide a network interface system by default. Instead, [network plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) provide this functionality. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides several supported Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. For information on supported plugins, see [Networking concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-network).

The supported plugins meet most networking needs in Kubernetes. However, advanced AKS users might want the same CNI plugin that they used in on-premises Kubernetes environments. Or these users might want to use advanced functionalities available in other CNI plugins.

This article shows how to deploy an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled. From there, you can install any CNI plugin that works in Azure.

## Support

Microsoft support can't assist with CNI-related issues in clusters that you deploy by bringing your own CNI plugin. For example, CNI-related issues would cover most east/west (pod to pod) traffic, along with `kubectl proxy`

and similar commands. If you want CNI-related support, use a supported AKS network plugin or seek support from the CNI plugin vendor.

Microsoft still provides support for issues that aren't related to CNI.

## Prerequisites

- For Azure Resource Manager or Bicep, use at least template version 2022-01-02-preview or 2022-06-01.
- For the Azure CLI, use at least version 2.39.0.
- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the address range for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual network. - The cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet or modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node's Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups). - AKS doesn't create a route table in the managed virtual network.
- You must specify a Pod CIDR (IP address range for pods). The AKS control plane uses this range for internal traffic routing to pods, even though pod IP assignment will be managed by your custom CNI. If no pod CIDR is provided, control plane to pod communication may fail or be misrouted. You must select a pod CIDR that does not conflict with any other network in your environment and avoids Azure reserved ranges, such as,
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

. For example, you might use a range such as`10.XX.0.0/16`

that is unique to your cluster. This ensures that the control plane can route directly to pod IPs on your nodes, and no IP overlap will occur if you integrate with other networks or clusters.

## Create an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled

Create an Azure resource group for your AKS cluster by using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location eastus --name myResourceGroup`

Create an AKS cluster by using the

command. Pass the`az aks create`

`--network-plugin`

parameter with the parameter value of`none`

.`az aks create \ --location eastus \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --network-plugin none \ --pod-cidr "10.10.0.0/16" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Deploy a CNI plugin

After AKS provisioning finishes, the cluster is online. But all the nodes are in a `NotReady`

state, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 NotReady agent 6m9s v1.21.9
$ kubectl get node -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].message'
NAME STATUS
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```


At this point, the cluster is ready for installation of a CNI plugin.

# Use Confidential Virtual Machines (CVM) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Confidential Virtual Machines (CVM)](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview) offer strong security and confidentiality for tenants. CVMs offer VM based Hardware Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that leverage SEV-SNP security features to deny the hypervisor and other host management code access to VM memory and state, providing defense in depth protections against operator access. These features enable node pools with CVM to target the migration of highly sensitive container workloads to AKS without any code refactoring while benefiting from the features of AKS. For example, you may require CVM if you have the following:

- Workloads that handle security critical data and/or sensitive customer data
- Services that are required to meet various compliance requirements, especially for government contracts. Without a scalable solution for securing data, this could potentially lead to the loss of accreditations and contracts.

In this article, you learn how to create AKS node pools using Confidential VM sizes.

## AKS supported confidential VM sizes

Azure offers a choice of [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/trusted-execution-environment) options from both AMD and Intel. These TEEs allow you to create Confidential VM environments with excellent price-to-performance ratios, all without requiring any code changes.

- AMD-based Confidential VMs, use AMD SEV-SNP technology, which is introduced with third Gen AMD EPYC™ processors.
- Intel-based Confidential VMs use Intel TDX, with fourth Gen Intel® Xeon® processors.

Both technologies have different implementations. However both provide similar protections from the cloud infrastructure stack. For more information, see [CVM VM sizes](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/virtual-machine-options).

## Security Features

CVMs offer the following security enhancements as compared to other virtual machine (VM) sizes:

- Robust hardware-based isolation between virtual machines, hypervisor, and host management code.
- Customizable attestation policies to ensure the host's compliance before deployment.
- Cloud-based Confidential OS disk encryption before the first boot.
- VM encryption keys that the platform or the customer (optionally) owns and manages.
- Secure key release with cryptographic binding between the platform's successful attestation and the VM's encryption keys.
- Dedicated virtual Trusted Platform Module (TPM) instance for attestation and protection of keys and secrets in the virtual machine.
- Secure boot capability similar to Trusted launch for Azure VMs

## How does it work?

If you're running a workload that requires enhanced confidentiality and integrity, you can benefit from memory encryption and enhanced security without code changes in your application. All pods on your CVM node are part of the same trust boundary. The nodes in a node pool created with CVM use a customized [node image](node-images) specially configured for CVM.

### Supported OS Versions

You can create CVM node pools on Linux OS types (Ubuntu and Azure Linux). However, not all OS versions support CVM node pools.

This table includes the supported OS versions:

| OS Type | OS SKU | CVM support | CVM default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | `Ubuntu` |
Supported | Ubuntu 20.04 is default for K8s version 1.24-1.33. Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for K8s version 1.34-1.38. |
| Linux | `Ubuntu2204` |
Not Supported | AKS doesn't support CVM for Ubuntu 22.04. |
| Linux | `Ubuntu2404` |
Supported | CVM is supported on `Ubuntu2404` in K8s 1.32-1.38. |
| Linux | `AzureLinux` |
Supported on Azure Linux 3.0 | Azure Linux 3 is default when enabling CVM for K8s version 1.28-1.36. |
| Linux | `flatcar` |
Not supported |
|

`AzureLinuxOSGuard`

[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard)doesn't support CVM.When using `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

as the `osSKU`

, if the default OS version doesn't support CVM, AKS defaults to the most recent CVM-supported version of the OS. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Linux node pools. Since 22.04 doesn't currently support CVM, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 20.04 for Linux CVM-enabled node pools.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply when adding a node pool with CVM to AKS:

- You can't use FIPS, ARM64, Trusted Launch, or Pod Sandboxing.
- You can't update an existing node pool to migrate to a CVM size. To migrate, you'll need to
[resize your node pool](resize-node-pool). - You can't use CVM with Windows node pools.
- CVM with Azure Linux is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An existing AKS cluster.
- CVM sizes must be available for your subscription in the region where the cluster is created. You must have sufficient quota to create a node pool with a CVM size.
- If you're using Azure Linux os, you need to install the
`aks-preview`

extension, update the`aks-preview`

extension, and register the preview feature flag. If you're using Ubuntu, you can skip these steps.

### If you are using Azure Linux

CVMs for Ubuntu is GA, but CVMs with Azure Linux is currently still in preview. If you would like to use CVM node pools with Azure Linux as the OS of choice, ensure you enable the extension and register the flag.

#### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


#### Register `AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

feature flag using the [`az feature register`

][az-feature-register] command.`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureLinuxCVMPreview"`

Verify the registration status using the [

`az feature show`

][az-feature-show] command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using the [`az provider register`

][az-provider-register] command.`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Add a node pool with a CVM to your AKS cluster

Add a node pool with a CVM to your AKS cluster using the

command and set the`az aks nodepool add`

`node-vm-size`

to a supported[VM size](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/virtual-machine-options).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_DC4as_v5`


If you don't specify the `osSKU`

or `osType`

, AKS defaults to `--os-type Linux`

and `--os-sku Ubuntu`

.

## Upgrade an existing node pool with a CVM to Ubuntu 24.04

Upgrade an existing node pool with a CVM to Ubuntu 24.04 from Ubuntu 20.04 using the

command. Set the`az aks nodepool update`

`os-sku`

as`Ubuntu2404`

.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --os-sku Ubuntu2404`


Note

A node pool which is Ubuntu 24.04 with a CVM is supported from AKS cluster 1.33 version. Additionally, before Ubuntu 24.04 becomes GA, you need to register the `Ubuntu2404Preview`

feature. For more information, see [ here](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version#register-ubuntu2404preview-feature-flag) to register the feature.

## Verify the node pool uses CVM

Verify a node pool uses CVM using the

command and verify the`az aks nodepool show`

`vmSize`

is`Standard_DCa4_v5`

.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'vmSize'`

The following example command and output shows the node pool uses CVM:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'vmSize' "Standard_DC4as_v5"`

Verify a node pool uses a CVM image using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'nodeImageVersion'`

The following example command and output shows the node pool uses an Ubuntu 20.04 CVM image:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'nodeImageVersion' "AKSUbuntu-2004cvmcontainerd-202507.02.0"`


## Remove a node pool with CVM from an AKS cluster

Remove a node pool with CVM from an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks nodepool delete`

`az aks nodepool delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to add a node pool with CVM to an AKS cluster.

- For more information about CVM, see
[Confidential VM node pools support on AKS](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-node-pool-aks). - To migrate an existing node pool to a CVM vm size, you can
[resize your node pool](resize-node-pool). - If you're only interested in enabling Trusted Launch on your node pools, see

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

Warning

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium begins enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

To perform the update, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-dataplane cilium

# Update Azure CNI IPAM mode and data plane technology for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters inevitably need an update to newer IP assignment management (IPAM) modes and data plane technologies to access the latest features and supportability. This article provides guidance on updating an existing AKS cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay for the IPAM mode and Azure CNI Powered by Cilium as the data plane.

## Update the IPAM mode to Azure CNI Overlay

Updating an existing cluster to Azure CNI Overlay is an irreversible process.

You can update an existing AKS cluster to Azure CNI Overlay if the cluster:

- Is on Kubernetes version 1.27 or later.
- Doesn't use the
[dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)feature. - Doesn't have network policies enabled. If you need to uninstall the network policy engine before updating your cluster, follow the steps in
[Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico). - Doesn't use any Windows node pools with Docker as the container runtime.

Before Windows OS build 20348.1668, there was a limitation around Windows overlay pods incorrectly routing packets from host network pods via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). This limitation had a detrimental effect for clusters that were updating to Azure CNI Overlay. To avoid this issue, use Windows OS build 20348.1668 or later.

Warning

If you're using a custom

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

configuration to include additional IP ranges that shouldn't send SNAT packets from pods, updating to Azure CNI Overlay can break connectivity to these ranges. Pod IPs from the overlay space are unreachable by anything outside the cluster nodes.For old clusters, a ConfigMap might be left over from a previous version of

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

. If this ConfigMap (named`azure-ip-masq-agent-config`

) exists and isn't intentionally in place, you should delete it before updating.If you're not using a custom

`ip-masq-agent`

configuration, only the`azure-ip-masq-agent-config-reconciled`

ConfigMap should exist with respect to Azure`ip-masq-agent`

ConfigMap. It's updated automatically during the update process.

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately to Azure CNI Overlay isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or Kubernetes version upgrade where each node in a node pool is reimaged.

Update an existing Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16
```


The `--pod-cidr`

parameter is required when you update from legacy CNI plugins because the pods need to get IPs from a new overlay space. The new overlay space doesn't overlap with the existing Azure CNI Node Subnet plugin.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

# Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

This article describes the legacy KMS experience for AKS. For new clusters running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later, we recommend using the new [KMS data encryption](kms-data-encryption) experience, which offers platform-managed keys, customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation, and a simplified configuration experience.

For conceptual information about data encryption options, see [Data encryption at rest concepts for AKS](kms-data-encryption-concepts).

This article shows you how to turn on encryption at rest for a public or private key vault using Azure Key Vault and the Key Management Service (KMS) plugin on AKS. You can use the KMS plugin to:

- Use a key in a key vault for etcd encryption.
- Bring your own keys.
- Provide encryption at rest for secrets stored in etcd.
- Rotate the keys in a key vault.

For more information on using KMS, see [Using a KMS provider for data encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
[Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.39.0 or later. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Warning

Starting on September 15, 2024, Konnectivity is no longer supported for private key vaults for new subscriptions or subscriptions that didn't previously use this configuration. For subscriptions currently using this configuration or used it in the past 60 days, support continues until AKS version 1.30 reaches end of life for community support.

KMS supports Konnectivity or [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for public key vaults.

KMS supports [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) for both private and public key vaults.

You can use `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`

to verify the results and show that a `konnectivity-agent`

pod is running. If a pod is running, the AKS cluster is using Konnectivity. When you use API Server VNet Integration, you can run the `az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

command to verify that the `enableVnetIntegration`

setting is set to `true`

.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate KMS etcd encryption with AKS:

- Deleting the key, the key vault, or the associated identity isn't supported.
- KMS etcd encryption doesn't work with system-assigned managed identity. The key vault access policy must be set before the feature is turned on. System-assigned managed identity isn't available until after the cluster is created. Consider the cycle dependency.
- Because the firewall blocks traffic from the KMS plugin to Key Vault, two scenarios aren't supported. First, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with the firewall option
*Allow public access from specific virtual networks and IP addresses*. Second, Azure Key Vault can't be configured with*Disable public access*unless[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)is enabled. - The maximum number of secrets supported by a cluster with KMS turned on is
*2,000*. However, it's important to note that[KMS v2](use-kms-v2)isn't limited by this restriction and can handle a higher number of secrets. - Bring your own (BYO) Azure key vault from another tenant isn't supported.
- With KMS turned on, you can't change the associated key vault mode (public versus private). To
[update a key vault mode](update-kms-key-vault), you must first turn off KMS, and then turn it on again. - If a cluster has KMS turned on and has a private key vault, it must use the
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)tunnel. Konnectivity isn't supported. - Using the Virtual Machine Scale Sets API to scale the nodes in the cluster down to zero deallocates the nodes. The cluster then goes down and becomes unrecoverable.
- After you turn off KMS, you can't delete or expire the keys. Such behaviors would cause the API server to stop working.
- For a private cluster with KMS enabled and virtual network integration that uses a private key vault, the network security group (NSG) must allow TCP port 443 from the API server to the private key vault's private endpoint IP address. This limitation needs to be considered when using other rules in the API subnet NSG or cluster subnet NSG.

## Create a key vault and key for a public key vault

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault. You can use a public key vault with or without Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC).

Warning

Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable.

If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see [Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a key vault with Azure RBAC using the

command. This example command also exports the key vault resource ID to an environment variable.`az keyvault create`

`export KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --enable-rbac-authorization true --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself permissions to create a key using the

command. This example assigns the Key Vault Crypto Officer role to the signed-in user.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) --assignee-principal-type "User" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`

Get the key ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az keyvault key show`

`export KEY_ID=$(az keyvault key show --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT --query 'key.kid' -o tsv) echo $KEY_ID`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a public key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a public key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a public key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a public key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a public key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_2_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a public key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a public key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a public key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable a public key vault and KMS on an existing AKS cluster

Enable KMS on a public key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Rotate existing keys in a public key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the public key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

KMS uses two keys at the same time. After the first key rotation, you need to ensure both the old and new keys are valid (not expired) until the next key rotation. After the second key rotation, the oldest key can be safely removed/expired.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Public" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Create a key vault and key for a private key vault

If you turn on KMS for a private key vault, AKS automatically creates a private endpoint and a private link in the node resource group. The key vault has a private endpoint connection with the AKS cluster.

Warning

Keep the following information in mind when using a private key vault:

- KMS only supports
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration)for private key vault. - Creating or updating keys in a private key vault that doesn't have a private endpoint isn't supported. To learn how to manage private key vaults, see
[Integrate a key vault by using Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/private-link-service). - Deleting the key or the key vault isn't supported and causes the secrets in the cluster to be unrecoverable. If you need to recover your key vault or your key, see
[Azure Key Vault recovery management with soft delete and purge protection](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-recovery?tabs=azure-cli).

Create a private key vault using the

command with the`az keyvault create`

`--public-network-access Disabled`

parameter.`az keyvault create --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --public-network-access Disabled`

Create a key using the

command.`az keyvault key create`

`az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT`


## Create a user-assigned managed identity for a private key vault

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Get the identity object ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID`

Get the identity resource ID and save it as an environment variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv) echo $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to decrypt and encrypt a private key vault

The following sections describe how to assign decrypt and encrypt permissions for a private key vault with or without Azure RBAC.

-
[Assign permissions for a private key vault with Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_rbac-kv) -
[Assign permissions for a private key vault without Azure RBAC](#tabpanel_3_non-rbac-kv)

Assign the Key Vault Crypto User role to give decrypt and encrypt permissions using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Crypto User" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Assign permissions to create a private link

For private key vaults, the Key Vault Contributor role is required to create a private link between the private key vault and the cluster.

Assign the Key Vault Contributor role using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Key Vault Contributor" --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


## Enable KMS for a private key vault on an AKS cluster

The following sections describe how to turn on KMS for a private key vault on a new or existing AKS cluster.

### Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS

Create an AKS cluster with a private key vault and KMS using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update an existing AKS cluster to turn on KMS etcd encryption for a private key vault

Enable KMS on a private key vault on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


### Rotate existing keys in a private key vault

After you change the key ID (including changing either the key name or the key version), you can rotate the existing keys in the private key vault.

Warning

Remember to update all secrets after key rotation. If you don't update all secrets, the secrets are inaccessible if the keys that were created earlier don't exist or no longer work.

After you rotate the key, the previous key (key1) is still cached and shouldn't be deleted. If you want to delete the previous key (key1) immediately, you need to rotate the key twice. Then key2 and key3 are cached, and key1 can be deleted without affecting the existing cluster.

After rotating KMS key version with the new `keyId`

, check `securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId`

in AKS resource json. Ensure the new key version is in use.

Rotate existing keys in a private key vault using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-keyvault-kms`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id`

,`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

, and`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id`

parameters.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $NEW_KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Disable KMS on an AKS cluster

Before you turn off KMS, verify that KMS is enabled on the cluster using the

command.`az aks list`

`az aks list --query "[].{Name:name, KmsEnabled:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.enabled, KeyId:securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms.keyId}" -o table`

Once confirmed, you can disable KMS using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

parameter.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`

# Configure LocalDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

LocalDNS is a feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) designed to enhance the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution performance and resiliency for workloads running in your cluster. When you deploy a DNS proxy on each node, LocalDNS reduces DNS query latency, improves reliability during network disruptions, and provides advanced configuration options for DNS caching and forwarding. This article explains how LocalDNS works, its configuration options, and how to enable, verify, and troubleshoot LocalDNS in your AKS clusters.

To learn about what LocalDNS is, including architecture details, and key capabilities, refer to [DNS Resolution in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](dns-concepts).

## Best practices for LocalDNS configuration

When implementing LocalDNS in your AKS clusters, consider the following best practices:

**Start with a minimal configuration**: Begin with a simple configuration that uses the`Preferred`

mode before moving to`Required`

mode. This setup allows you to validate that LocalDNS works as expected without breaking your cluster.**Implement proper caching strategies**: Configure cache settings based on your workload characteristics:- For frequently changing records, use shorter
`cacheDurationInSeconds`

values. When doing so, it's important to note that cacheDurationInSeconds acts as a cap on the DNS record TTL but doesn't increase it. The resulting TTL is the smaller of what is returned from upstream or what is set in the cache plugin. - For stable records, use longer cache durations to reduce DNS queries.
- Enable
`serveStale`

with appropriate settings to maintain service during DNS outages. - Caching with LocalDNS operates on a best effort basis and doesn't guarantee stale responses. The cache is divided into 256 shards and with a default maximum of 10,000 entries, allowing each shard to hold about 39 entries. When a shard is full and a new entry needs to be added, one of the existing entries is chosen at random to be evicted. There's no preference for older or expires entries. As a result, a stale record might not always be available, especially under high query volume.

- For frequently changing records, use shorter
**Monitor DNS performance**: After enabling LocalDNS, monitor your application's DNS performance using:- Application performance metrics.
- Node metrics to detect reduced network pressure.
- Log entries when
`queryLogging`

is set to`Log`

.

**Follow least privilege principle**: When configuring DNS forwarding rules, only allow access to the required DNS servers and domains.**Test before production deployment**: Always test LocalDNS configuration in a nonproduction environment before rolling it out to production clusters.**Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Store your*localdnsconfig.json*file in your infrastructure repository and include it in your AKS deployment templates.**Network configuration for TCP forwarding**: When using TCP for DNS forwarding to VnetDNS, ensure that your Network Security Groups (NSGs), firewalls, or Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) don't block TCP traffic between CoreDNS/LocalDNS and VnetDNS servers.**Avoid enabling both NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS**: It isn't recommended to enable both the upstream Kubernetes NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS in your node pool. While AKS doesn't block this configuration, all DNS traffic is routed through LocalDNS, which might lead to unexpected behavior or reduced benefits from NodeLocal DNSCache.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an existing AKS cluster with Kubernetes versions 1.31 or later to use LocalDNS. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - This article requires version 2.80.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- LocalDNS is only supported on node pools running Azure Linux or Ubuntu 22.04 or newer.
- The Virtual Machine (VM) SKU used for your node pool must have at least 4 vCPUs (cores) to support LocalDNS.
- LocalDNS isn't compatible with
[applied FQDN filter policies in Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies).

## Manage LocalDNS on an AKS cluster

LocalDNS is configured at the node pool level in AKS, meaning you can enable or disable LocalDNS independently for each node pool in your cluster. This tailors DNS resolution behavior based on the specific requirements of different workloads or environments. To enable LocalDNS on a node pool, you need to provide a configuration file: *localdnsconfig.json* that defines how LocalDNS should operate for that node pool.

If you don't specify a custom configuration file, AKS automatically applies a default LocalDNS configuration.

Note

If you're using Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP), see [LocalDNS configuration](node-auto-provisioning-aksnodeclass#localdns-configuration) for instructions on how to enable LocalDNS with NAP.

To enable LocalDNS during node pool creation, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool add --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


To enable LocalDNS on an existing node pool, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool update --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


Important

Enabling LocalDNS on a node pool initiates a reimage operation on all nodes within that pool. This process can cause temporary disruption to running workloads and might lead to application downtime if not properly managed. You should plan for potential service interruptions and ensure that the applications are configured for high availability or have appropriate disruption budgets in place before enabling this setting.

## Create a custom server block in LocalDNS

CoreDNS matches queries to a specific server block based on an exact match for domain being queried and not on partial matches. If you have the need for custom server blocks, you can add them to your LocalDNS configuration by creating a file called *localdnsconfig.json* with the added configurations.

For example, if you have specific DNS needs when accessing microsoft.com, you could use the following server block:

```
"microsoft.com": {
"queryLogging": "Error",
"protocol": "ForceTCP",
"forwardDestination": "ClusterCoreDNS",
"forwardPolicy": "Sequential",
"maxConcurrent": 1000,
"cacheDurationInSeconds": 3600,
"serveStaleDurationInSeconds": 3600,
"serveStale": "Immediate"
}
```


## Monitor LocalDNS

LocalDNS exposes Prometheus metrics that you can use for monitoring and alerting. These [metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default#coredns) are exposed on port `9253`

of the Node IP and can be scraped from there.

The following example YAML shows a scrape configuration you can use with the [Azure Managed Prometheus add on as a DaemonSet](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration):

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: ama-metrics-prometheus-config-node
namespace: kube-system
data:
prometheus-config: |-
global:
scrape_interval: 1m
scrape_configs:
- job_name: localdns-metrics
scrape_interval: 1m
scheme: http
metrics_path: /metrics
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__metrics_path__]
regex: (.*)
target_label: metrics_path
- source_labels: [__address__]
replacement: '$NODE_NAME'
target_label: instance
static_configs:
- targets: ['$NODE_IP:9253']
```


## Troubleshoot LocalDNS

### DNS queries to specific domains are failing

If DNS queries to specific domains are failing after enabling LocalDNS:

- Check if you have domain-specific overrides in your
*localdnsconfig.json*that might be misconfigured. - Temporarily try removing domain-specific overrides and using only the default
`.`

configuration. - Check if the issue occurs with both User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) by adjusting the
`protocol`

setting.

### Update VNet DNS servers for LocalDNS

When you update custom DNS servers directly in the VNet configuration (using the Azure portal or CLI), these changes aren't automatically applied to your AKS cluster nodes. This happens because updating DNS settings at the VNet level only informs the Network Resource Provider (NRP), but doesn't notify the AKS Resource Provider. As a result, AKS nodes continue to use the previous DNS server settings until further action is taken.

To ensure AKS nodes pick up the new VNet DNS server settings:

Update the VNet DNS configuration using the Azure portal or APIs as needed.

Reimage the node pool through the AKS Resource Provider to apply and persist the DNS changes:

`az aks nodepool upgrade --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool --node-image-only`


This process ensures the AKS Resource Provider is aware of the DNS changes and applies them to all nodes in the node pool.

# Upgrade node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to upgrade a single node pool and how to upgrade the cluster control plane for multiple node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Note

As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same Kubernetes version. The default behavior of [`az aks upgrade`

][az-aks-upgrade] is to upgrade all node pools together with the control plane to achieve this alignment. The ability to upgrade individual node pools lets you perform a rolling upgrade and schedule pods between node pools to maintain application uptime.

## Upgrade a single node pool

Note

The node pool operating system (OS) image version is tied to the Kubernetes version of the cluster. You only get OS image upgrades following a cluster upgrade.

Check for any available upgrades using the [

`az aks get-upgrades`

][az-aks-get-upgrades] command.`az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

Upgrade a specific node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --kubernetes-version <kubernetes-version> \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Upgrading*state:`[ { ... "count": 3, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "<kubernetes-version>", ... "provisioningState": "Upgrading", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "<kubernetes-version-2>", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes to upgrade the nodes to the specified version. After the upgrade is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Upgrade a cluster control plane with multiple node pools

An AKS cluster has two cluster resource objects with Kubernetes versions associated to them: the cluster control plane Kubernetes version and a node pool with a Kubernetes version.

### Upgrade behavior for the control plane and node pools

The control plane maps to one or many node pools. The behavior of an upgrade operation depends on which Azure CLI command you use and the flags you specify:

upgrades the control plane and all node pools in the cluster to the same Kubernetes version.`az aks upgrade`

with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag upgrades only the cluster control plane and leaves all node pools unchanged.upgrades only the target node pool with the specified Kubernetes version.`az aks nodepool upgrade`


### Validation rules for upgrades

Note

Kubernetes uses the standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme. The version number is expressed as *x.y.z*, where *x* is the major version, *y* is the minor version, and *z* is the patch version. For example, in version *1.12.6*, *1* is the major version, *12* is the minor version, and *6* is the patch version. The Kubernetes version of the control plane and the initial node pool are set during cluster creation. Other node pools have their Kubernetes version set when they are added to the cluster. The Kubernetes versions may differ between node pools and between a node pool and the control plane.

Kubernetes upgrades for a cluster control plane and node pools are validated using the following sets of rules:

**Rules for valid versions to upgrade node pools**:- The node pool version must have the same
*major*version as the control plane. - The node pool
*minor*version must be within two*minor*versions of the control plane version. - The node pool version can't be greater than the control
`major.minor.patch`

version.

- The node pool version must have the same
**Rules for submitting an upgrade operation**:- You can't downgrade the control plane or a node pool Kubernetes version.
- If a node pool Kubernetes version isn't specified, the behavior depends on the client. In Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, declaration falls back to the existing version defined for the node pool. If nothing is set, it falls back to the control plane version.
- You can't simultaneously submit multiple operations on a single control plane or node pool resource. You can either upgrade or scale a control plane or a node pool at a given time.

# Stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes.

## Overview

To stay within a supported Kubernetes version, you have to upgrade your cluster at least once per year and prepare for all possible disruptions. These disruptions include ones caused by API breaking changes, deprecations, and dependencies such as Helm and Container Storage Interface (CSI). It can be difficult to anticipate these disruptions and migrate critical workloads without experiencing any downtime.

You can configure your AKS cluster to automatically stop upgrade operations consisting of a minor version change with deprecated APIs and alert you to the issue. This feature helps you avoid unexpected disruptions and gives you time to address the deprecated APIs before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- The upgrade operation is a Kubernetes minor version change for the cluster control plane.
- The Kubernetes version you're upgrading to is 1.26 or later.
- The last seen usage of deprecated APIs for the targeted version you're upgrading to must occur within 12 hours before the upgrade operation. AKS records usage hourly, so any usage of deprecated APIs within one hour isn't guaranteed to appear in the detection.

## Mitigate stopped upgrade operations

If you meet the [prerequisites](#before-you-begin), attempt an upgrade, and receive an error message similar to the following example error message:

```
Bad Request({
"code": "ValidationError",
"message": "Control Plane upgrade is blocked due to recent usage of a Kubernetes API deprecated in the specified version. Please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide to migrate the usage. To bypass this error, set enable-force-upgrade in upgradeSettings.overrideSettings. Bypassing this error without migrating usage will result in the deprecated Kubernetes API calls failing. Usage details: 1 error occurred:\n\t* usage has been detected on API flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io.prioritylevelconfigurations.v1beta1, and was recently seen at: 2023-03-23 20:57:18 +0000 UTC, which will be removed in 1.26\n\n",
"subcode": "UpgradeBlockedOnDeprecatedAPIUsage"
})
```


You have two options to mitigate the issue: you can [remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)](#remove-usage-of-deprecated-apis-recommended) or [bypass validation to ignore API changes](#bypass-validation-to-ignore-api-changes).

### Remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)

In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster resource and select

**Diagnose and solve problems**Select

**Create, Upgrade, Delete, and Scale**>**Kubernetes API deprecations**.Wait 12 hours from the time the last deprecated API usage was seen. Read-Only verbs are excluded from the deprecated api usage namely

[Get/List/Watch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/).(You can also check past API usage by enabling[Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query#resource-logs)and exploring kube audit logs.)Retry your cluster upgrade.


### Bypass validation to ignore API changes

Note

This method requires you to use the Azure CLI version 2.57 or later. If you have the preview CLI extension installed, you need to update to version `3.0.0b10`

or later. This method isn't recommended, as deprecated APIs in the targeted Kubernetes version might not work long term. We recommend removing them as soon as possible after the upgrade completes.

Bypass validation to ignore API breaking changes and invoke an upgrade. Specify the

`enable-force-upgrade`

flag and set the`upgrade-override-until`

property to define the end of the window during which validation is bypassed. If no value is set, it defaults the window to three days from the current time. The date and time you specify must be in the future.`az aks upgrade --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --kubernetes-version $KUBERNETES_VERSION --enable-force-upgrade --upgrade-override-until 2023-10-01T13:00:00Z`

Note

`Z`

is the zone designator for the zero UTC/GMT offset, also known as 'Zulu' time. This example sets the end of the window to`13:00:00`

GMT. For more information, see[Combined date and time representations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).

# What is container network metrics?

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Advanced Container Networking Services in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) facilitates the collection of comprehensive container network metrics to give you valuable insights into the performance of your containerized environment. The capability continuously captures essential metrics at the node level and pod level, including traffic volume, dropped packets, connection states, and Domain Name System (DNS) resolution times for effective monitoring and optimizing network performance.

Capturing these metrics is essential for understanding how containers communicate, how traffic flows between services, and where bottlenecks or disruptions might occur. Advanced Container Networking Services integrates seamlessly with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to give you a complete view of networking metrics. Use the metrics for in-depth troubleshooting, network optimization, and performance tuning.

In a cloud-native world, maintaining a healthy and efficient network in a dynamic containerized environment is vital to ensuring that applications perform as expected. Without proper visibility into network traffic and its patterns, identifying potential issues or inefficiencies becomes challenging.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Key benefits

Deep visibility into network performance

Enhanced troubleshooting and optimization

Proactive anomaly detection

Better resource management and scaling

Capacity planning and compliance

Source-level metrics filtering for cost optimization and noise reduction with

[container network metrics filtering](#container-network-metrics-filtering-preview)Simplified metrics storage and visualization options. Choose between:

**Azure managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana**: Azure manages the infrastructure and maintenance, so you can focus on configuring metrics and visualizing metrics.**Bring your own (BYO) Prometheus and Grafana**: You deploy and configure your own instances of Prometheus and Grafana, and you manage the underlying infrastructure.


## Metrics captured

### Node-level metrics

Understanding the health of your container network at the node-level is crucial for maintaining optimal application performance. These metrics provide insights into traffic volume, dropped packets, number of connections, and other data by node. The metrics are stored in Prometheus format, so, you can view them in Grafana.

The following metrics are aggregated per node. All metrics include one of these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)

For Cilium data plane scenarios, Container Network Observability provides metrics only for Linux. Windows is currently not supported. Cilium exposes several metrics including the following used by Container Network Observability.

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
cilium_forward_count_total |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_forward_bytes_total |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_drop_count_total |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |
cilium_drop_bytes_total |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |

### Pod-level metrics (Hubble metrics)

These Prometheus metrics include source and destination pod information so that you can pinpoint network-related issues at a granular level. Metrics cover information like traffic volume, dropped packets, TCP resets, and Layer 4/Layer 7 packet flows. DNS metrics like DNS errors and DNS requests missing responses are collected by default for non-Cilium data planes. For Cilium data planes, a Cilium FQDN network policy is required to collect DNS metrics, or customers can also troubleshoot DNS using Hubble CLI and observing real-time logs.

The following table describes the metrics that are aggregated per pod (node information is preserved).

All metrics include labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)`source`

or`destination`

For

*outgoing traffic*, a`source`

label that indicates the source pod namespace and name is applied.For

*incoming traffic*, a`destination`

label that indicates the destination pod namespace and name is applied.


| Metric name | Description | Extra Labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
hubble_dns_queries_total |
Total DNS requests by query | `source` or `destination` , `query` , `qtypes` (query type) |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_dns_responses_total |
Total DNS responses by query/response | `source` or `destination` , `query` , `qtypes` (query type), `rcode` (return code), `ips_returned` (number of IPs) |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_drop_total |
Total dropped packet count | `source` or `destination` , `protocol` , `reason` |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_tcp_flags_total |
Total TCP packets count by flag | `source` or `destination` , `flag` |
✅ | ❌ |
hubble_flows_processed_total |
Total network flows processed (Layer 4/Layer 7 traffic) | `source` or `destination` , `protocol` , `verdict` , `type` , `subtype` |
✅ | ❌ |

## Container network metrics filtering (Preview)

Now that you have the ability to collect comprehensive metrics at both node and pod levels, you might find yourself dealing with a significant volume of data. To help reduce noise and optimize storage costs, Container Network Observability introduces **container network metrics filtering**. This feature enables you to filter metrics at the source before they are collected and stored, giving you control over which metrics are most relevant to your specific monitoring and troubleshooting needs. This feature is only available for Cilium clusters.

Container network metrics filtering is particularly valuable in large-scale production environments where the sheer volume of metrics can impact storage costs and query performance. By filtering out unnecessary metrics early in the collection process, you can focus on the data that matters most to your operations while maintaining the visibility you need for effective network monitoring.

The filtering capability supports multiple dimensions including namespace-based filtering to focus on specific applications, pod and label-based filtering for targeted monitoring, and metric-specific filtering to collect only the types of metrics that are essential for your use case. This flexibility allows you to strike the right balance between comprehensive observability and cost-effective operations.

To learn more on how to enable container network metrics filtering, see [How to Configure Container Network Metrics Filtering ](how-to-configure-container-network-metrics-filtering).

### Limitations

- Pod-level metrics are available only on Linux.
- Cilium data plane is supported starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
- Metric labels have subtle differences between Cilium and non-Cilium clusters.
- For Cilium based clusters, DNS metrics are only available for pods that have Cilium Network policies (CNP) configured on their clusters, or customers can also troubleshoot DNS using Hubble CLI and observing real-time logs.
- Flow logs are not currently available in the air gapped cloud.
- Hubble relay may crash if one of the Hubble node agents goes down and may cause interruptions to Hubble CLI.
- When using Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) on non-Cilium data planes, FIPS support isn't available on Ubuntu 20.04 nodes due to kernel restrictions. To enable FIPS in this scenario, you must use an Azure Linux node pool. This limitation is expected to be resolved with the release of Ubuntu 22 FIPS. For updates, see the
[AKS issue tracker](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4857). - Container network metrics filtering is only available for Cilium Clusters.

Refer to the FIPS support matrix below:

| Operating System | FIPS Support |
|---|---|
| Azure Linux 3.0 | Yes |
| Azure Linux 2.0 | Yes |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | No |

This limitation does not apply when ACNS is running on Cilium data planes.

### Scale

The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor and Azure Managed Grafana impose service-specific scale limitations. For more information, see [Scrape Prometheus metrics at scale in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-scale).

## Pricing

Important

Advanced Container Networking Services is a paid offering.

For more information about pricing, see [Advanced Container Networking Services - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-container-networking-services/).

# Update Azure CNI IPAM mode and data plane technology for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters inevitably need an update to newer IP assignment management (IPAM) modes and data plane technologies to access the latest features and supportability. This article provides guidance on updating an existing AKS cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay for the IPAM mode and Azure CNI Powered by Cilium as the data plane.

## Update the IPAM mode to Azure CNI Overlay

Updating an existing cluster to Azure CNI Overlay is an irreversible process.

You can update an existing AKS cluster to Azure CNI Overlay if the cluster:

- Is on Kubernetes version 1.27 or later.
- Doesn't use the
[dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)feature. - Doesn't have network policies enabled. If you need to uninstall the network policy engine before updating your cluster, follow the steps in
[Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico). - Doesn't use any Windows node pools with Docker as the container runtime.

Before Windows OS build 20348.1668, there was a limitation around Windows overlay pods incorrectly routing packets from host network pods via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). This limitation had a detrimental effect for clusters that were updating to Azure CNI Overlay. To avoid this issue, use Windows OS build 20348.1668 or later.

Warning

If you're using a custom

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

configuration to include additional IP ranges that shouldn't send SNAT packets from pods, updating to Azure CNI Overlay can break connectivity to these ranges. Pod IPs from the overlay space are unreachable by anything outside the cluster nodes.For old clusters, a ConfigMap might be left over from a previous version of

`azure-ip-masq-agent`

. If this ConfigMap (named`azure-ip-masq-agent-config`

) exists and isn't intentionally in place, you should delete it before updating.If you're not using a custom

`ip-masq-agent`

configuration, only the`azure-ip-masq-agent-config-reconciled`

ConfigMap should exist with respect to Azure`ip-masq-agent`

ConfigMap. It's updated automatically during the update process.

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately to Azure CNI Overlay isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or Kubernetes version upgrade where each node in a node pool is reimaged.

Update an existing Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) cluster to use Azure CNI Overlay by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16
```


The `--pod-cidr`

parameter is required when you update from legacy CNI plugins because the pods need to get IPs from a new overlay space. The new overlay space doesn't overlap with the existing Azure CNI Node Subnet plugin.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for the pod also can't overlap with any virtual network address of the node pools. For example, if your virtual network address is 10.0.0.0/8, and your nodes are in the subnet 10.240.0.0/16, the `--pod-cidr`

parameter can't overlap with 10.0.0.0/8 or the existing service CIDR on the cluster.

## Update the data plane to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

When you enable Cilium in a cluster that uses a different network policy engine (Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico), the network policy engine is uninstalled and replaced with Cilium. For more information, see [Uninstall Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico](use-network-policies#uninstall-azure-network-policy-manager-or-calico).

You can update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium if the cluster doesn't have any Windows node pools.

Warning

The update process triggers node pools to be reimaged simultaneously. Updating each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image update or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium begins enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

To perform the update, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--network-dataplane cilium
```

# Bring your own CNI plugin with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes doesn't provide a network interface system by default. Instead, [network plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) provide this functionality. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides several supported Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. For information on supported plugins, see [Networking concepts for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-network).

The supported plugins meet most networking needs in Kubernetes. However, advanced AKS users might want the same CNI plugin that they used in on-premises Kubernetes environments. Or these users might want to use advanced functionalities available in other CNI plugins.

This article shows how to deploy an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled. From there, you can install any CNI plugin that works in Azure.

## Support

Microsoft support can't assist with CNI-related issues in clusters that you deploy by bringing your own CNI plugin. For example, CNI-related issues would cover most east/west (pod to pod) traffic, along with `kubectl proxy`

and similar commands. If you want CNI-related support, use a supported AKS network plugin or seek support from the CNI plugin vendor.

Microsoft still provides support for issues that aren't related to CNI.

## Prerequisites

- For Azure Resource Manager or Bicep, use at least template version 2022-01-02-preview or 2022-06-01.
- For the Azure CLI, use at least version 2.39.0.
- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the address range for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual network. - The cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet or modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node's Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups). - AKS doesn't create a route table in the managed virtual network.
- You must specify a Pod CIDR (IP address range for pods). The AKS control plane uses this range for internal traffic routing to pods, even though pod IP assignment will be managed by your custom CNI. If no pod CIDR is provided, control plane to pod communication may fail or be misrouted. You must select a pod CIDR that does not conflict with any other network in your environment and avoids Azure reserved ranges, such as,
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

. For example, you might use a range such as`10.XX.0.0/16`

that is unique to your cluster. This ensures that the control plane can route directly to pod IPs on your nodes, and no IP overlap will occur if you integrate with other networks or clusters.

## Create an AKS cluster with no CNI plugin preinstalled

Create an Azure resource group for your AKS cluster by using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location eastus --name myResourceGroup`

Create an AKS cluster by using the

command. Pass the`az aks create`

`--network-plugin`

parameter with the parameter value of`none`

.`az aks create \ --location eastus \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --network-plugin none \ --pod-cidr "10.10.0.0/16" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Deploy a CNI plugin

After AKS provisioning finishes, the cluster is online. But all the nodes are in a `NotReady`

state, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 NotReady agent 6m9s v1.21.9
$ kubectl get node -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].message'
NAME STATUS
aks-nodepool1-23902496-vmss000000 container runtime network not ready: NetworkReady=false reason:NetworkPluginNotReady message:Network plugin returns error: cni plugin not initialized
```


At this point, the cluster is ready for installation of a CNI plugin.
