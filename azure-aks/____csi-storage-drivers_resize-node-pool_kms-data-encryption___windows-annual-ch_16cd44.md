# Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Kubernetes. By adopting and using CSI, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can write, deploy, and iterate plug-ins to expose new or improve existing storage systems in Kubernetes without having to touch the core Kubernetes code and wait for its release cycles.

The CSI storage driver support on AKS allows you to natively use:

can be used to create a Kubernetes**Azure Disks***DataDisk*resource. Disks can use Azure Premium Storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard Storage, backed by regular HDDs or Standard SSDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium Storage. Azure Disks are mounted as*ReadWriteOnce*and are only available to one node in AKS. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple nodes simultaneously, use Azure Files.can be used to mount an SMB 3.0/3.1 share backed by an Azure storage account to pods. With Azure Files, you can share data across multiple nodes and pods. Azure Files can use Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs or Azure Premium storage backed by high-performance SSDs.**Azure Files**can be used to mount Blob storage (or object storage) as a file system into a container or pod. Using Blob storage enables your cluster to support applications that work with large unstructured datasets like log file data, images or documents, HPC, and others. Additionally, if you ingest data into**Azure Blob storage**[Azure Data Lake storage](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), you can directly mount and use it in AKS without configuring another interim filesystem.

Tip

If you want a fully managed solution for block-level access to data, consider using [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction) instead of CSI drivers. Azure Container Storage integrates with Kubernetes, allowing dynamic and automatic provisioning of persistent volumes. Azure Container Storage supports Azure Disks, Ephemeral Disks, and Azure Elastic SAN (preview) as backing storage, offering flexibility and scalability for stateful applications running on Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.42 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If the open-source CSI storage driver is installed on your cluster, uninstall it before enabling the Azure storage CSI driver.
- To enforce the Azure Policy for AKS
[policy definition](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#kubernetes)**Kubernetes clusters should use Container Storage Interface(CSI) driver StorageClass**, the Azure Policy add-on needs to be enabled on new and existing clusters. For an existing cluster, review the[Learn Azure Policy for Kubernetes](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes)to enable it.

## Disk encryption supported scenarios

CSI storage drivers support the following scenarios:

[Encrypted managed disks with customer-managed keys](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-cross-tenant-customer-managed-keys)using Azure Key Vaults stored in a different Microsoft Entra tenant.- Encrypt your Azure Storage disks hosting AKS OS and application data with
[customer-managed keys](azure-disk-customer-managed-keys).

## Enable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster

To enable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--enable-disk-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--enable-file-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--enable-blob-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--enable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to enable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --enable-disk-driver --enable-file-driver --enable-blob-driver --enable-snapshot-controller
```


It might take several minutes to complete this action. Once it's complete, you should see in the output the status of enabling the driver on your cluster. The following example resembles the section indicating the results when enabling the Blob storage CSI driver:

```
"storageProfile": {
"blobCsiDriver": {
"enabled": true
},
```


## Disable CSI storage drivers on a new or existing cluster

To disable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--disable-disk-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--disable-file-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--disable-blob-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--disable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to disable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks create \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


To disable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster, use one of the parameters listed earlier depending on the storage system:

```
az aks update \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller
```


Note

We recommend deleting the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim object instead of the PersistentVolume object when deleting a CSI volume. The external provisioner in the CSI driver will react to the deletion of the PersistentVolumeClaim and based on its reclamation policy, it issues the DeleteVolume call against the CSI volume driver commands to delete the volume. The PersistentVolume object is then deleted.

## Migrate custom in-tree storage classes to CSI

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.26, in-tree persistent volume types *kubernetes.io/azure-disk* and *kubernetes.io/azure-file* are deprecated and will no longer be supported. *In-tree drivers* refers to the storage drivers that are part of the core Kubernetes code opposed to the CSI drivers, which are plug-ins.

Removing these drivers following their deprecation isn't planned, however you should migrate to the corresponding CSI drivers *disk.csi.azure.com* and *file.csi.azure.com*. To review the migration options for your storage classes and upgrade your cluster to use Azure Disks and Azure Files CSI drivers, see [Migrate from in-tree to CSI drivers](csi-migrate-in-tree-volumes).

If you've created in-tree driver storage classes, those storage classes continue to work since CSI migration is turned on after upgrading your cluster to 1.21.x. If you want to use CSI features you'll need to perform the migration.

## Next steps

- To use the CSI driver for Azure Disks, see
[Use Azure Disks with CSI drivers](azure-disk-csi). - To use the CSI driver for Azure Files, see
[Use Azure Files with CSI drivers](azure-files-csi). - To use the CSI driver for Azure Blob storage, see
[Use Azure Blob storage with CSI drivers](azure-blob-csi) - For more about storage best practices, see
[Best practices for storage and backups in Azure Kubernetes Service](operator-best-practices-storage). - For more information on CSI migration, see
[Kubernetes in-tree to CSI Volume Migration](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/09/kubernetes-1-17-feature-csi-migration-beta).

# Resize node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You might want to change the size of your virtual machines (VMs) to accommodate an increasing number of deployments or to run a larger workload. Resizing AKS instances directly isn't supported when using [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) in AKS, as outlined in the [support policies for AKS](support-policies#user-customization-of-agent-nodes):

AKS agent nodes appear in the Azure portal as regular Azure IaaS resources. But these virtual machines are deployed into a custom Azure resource group (usually prefixed with MC_*). You can't make direct customizations to these nodes using the IaaS APIs or resources. Any custom changes that aren't done via the AKS API won't persist through an upgrade, scale, update, or reboot.


In this article, you learn the recommended method to resize a node pool by creating a new node pool with the desired SKU size, cordoning and draining the existing nodes, and then removing the existing node pool.

Important

This method is specific to [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview)-based AKS clusters. When using Virtual Machines-based node pools, you can easily update the VM sizes in an existing node pool using a single Azure CLI command and have multiple VM sizes in the same node pool. For more information, see the [Virtual Machines node pools documentation](virtual-machines-node-pools).

## Create a new node pool with the desired SKU

Note

Every AKS cluster must contain at least one system node pool with at least one node. In this example, we use a `--mode`

of `System`

to add a system node pool to replace the system node pool we want to resize. You can [update the mode of a node pool](use-system-pools#update-existing-cluster-system-and-user-node-pools) at any time. You can also add a user node pool by setting `--mode`

to `User`

.

When resizing, make sure you consider all workload requirements, such as availability zones, and configure your VMSS node pool accordingly. You might need to modify the following command to best fit your needs. For a full list of the configuration options, see the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) reference page.

Create a new node pool using the

command. In this example, we create a new node pool,`az aks nodepool add`

`mynodepool`

, with three nodes and the`Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU to replace an existing node pool,`nodepool1`

, that has the`Standard_DS2_v2`

VM SKU.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name mynodepool \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS3_v2 \ --mode System \ --no-wait`

It takes a few minutes for the new node pool to be created.

Get the status of the new node pool using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing both the new node pool

`mynodepool`

and the existing node pool`nodepool1`

:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000000 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000001 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000002 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9`


## Cordon the existing nodes

Cordoning marks specified nodes as unschedulable and prevents any more pods from being added to the nodes.

Get the names of the nodes you want to cordon using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing the nodes in the existing node pool

`nodepool1`

that you want to cordon:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9`

Cordon the existing nodes using the

`kubectl cordon`

command, specifying the desired nodes in a space-separated list. For example:`kubectl cordon aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing that the nodes are cordoned:

`node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 cordoned node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 cordoned node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 cordoned`


## Drain the existing nodes

Important

To successfully drain nodes and evict running pods, ensure that any PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) allow for at least one pod replica to be moved at a time. Otherwise, the drain/evict operation fails. To check this, you can run `kubectl get pdb -A`

and verify `ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS`

is at least `1`

or higher.

When you drain nodes, the pods running on them are evicted and recreated on the other schedulable nodes.

Drain the existing nodes using the

`kubectl drain`

command with the`--ignore-daemonsets`

and`--delete-emptydir-data`

flags, specifying the desired nodes in a space-separated list. For example:Important

Using

`--delete-emptydir-data`

is required to evict the AKS-created`coredns`

and`metrics-server`

pods. If you don't use this flag, you get an error. For more information, see the[documentation on emptydir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).`kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`

After the drain operation finishes, all pods (excluding the pods controlled by daemon sets) should be running on the new node pool. You can verify this using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide -A`


### Troubleshoot pod eviction issues

You might encounter the following error when draining nodes:


`Error when evicting pods/[podname] -n [namespace] (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.`


By default, your cluster has AKS-managed pod disruption budgets (such as `coredns-pdb`

or `konnectivity-agent`

) with a `MinAvailable`

of `1`

. For example, if there are two `coredns`

pods running, only one can be disrupted at a time. While one of them is getting recreated and is unavailable, the other `coredns`

pod can't be evicted due to the pod disruption budget. This issue resolves itself after the initial `coredns`

pod is scheduled and running, allowing the second pod to be properly evicted and recreated.

Tip

Consider draining nodes one by one for a smoother eviction experience and to avoid throttling. For more information, see:

## Remove the existing node pool

Important

When you delete a node pool, AKS doesn't perform cordon and drain. To minimize the disruption of rescheduling pods currently running on the node pool you plan to delete, perform a cordon and drain on all nodes in the node pool before deleting.

Delete the original node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool delete`

`az aks nodepool delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1`

Verify that your AKS cluster has only the new node pool with the applications and pods properly running using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing only the new node pool

`mynodepool`

:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000000 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000001 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000002 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9`


## Next steps

After resizing a node pool by cordoning and draining, learn more about [using multiple node pools](create-node-pools).

# Enable KMS data encryption in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to enable Key Management Service (KMS) data encryption for Kubernetes secrets in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). KMS encryption encrypts Kubernetes secrets stored in etcd using Azure Key Vault keys.

AKS supports two key management options:

**Platform-managed keys (PMK)**: AKS automatically creates and manages the encryption keys. This option provides the simplest setup with automatic key rotation.**Customer-managed keys (CMK)**: You create and manage your own Azure Key Vault and encryption keys. This option provides full control over key lifecycle and meets compliance requirements that mandate customer-managed keys.

For more information about encryption concepts and key options, see [Data encryption at rest concepts for AKS](kms-data-encryption-concepts).

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


- This article requires version 2.73.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed there.
- You need the
`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension version*19.0.0b13*or later.- If you don't already have the
`aks-preview`

extension, install it using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

- If you already have the
`aks-preview`

extension, update it to make sure you have the latest version using thecommand.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


- If you don't already have the
`kubectl`

CLI tool installed.

### Register the feature flag

To use KMS data encryption with platform-managed keys, register the `KMSPMKPreview`

feature flag in your subscription.

Register the feature flag using the

command.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name KMSPMKPreview`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name KMSPMKPreview`

When the status shows

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Set up environment variables

Set up environment variables for your deployment. Replace the placeholder values with your own.

```
# Set environment variables
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group>"
export LOCATION="<your-location>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<your-cluster-name>"
# Set subscription
az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID
# Create resource group if it doesn't exist
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


## Enable platform-managed key encryption

With platform-managed keys, AKS automatically creates and manages the Azure Key Vault and encryption keys. Key rotation is handled automatically by the platform.

### Create a new AKS cluster with platform-managed keys

Create a new AKS cluster with KMS encryption using platform-managed keys.

```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kubernetes-version 1.33.0 \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Enable platform-managed keys on an existing cluster

Enable KMS encryption with platform-managed keys on an existing AKS cluster.

Note

The cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled
```


### Verify KMS configuration

After enabling KMS encryption, verify the configuration.

```
az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'securityProfile'
```


The output includes the KMS configuration:

```
{
"kubernetesResourceObjectEncryptionProfile": {
"infrastructureEncryption": "Enabled"
}
}
```


## Enable customer-managed key encryption with a private key vault

For enhanced security, you can use a private key vault that has public network access disabled. AKS accesses the private key vault through the [trusted services firewall exception](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/network-security#key-vault-firewall-enabled-trusted-services-only). This section shows how to configure customer-managed keys with a private key vault.

### Create a key vault and key with trusted services access

Note

This section illustrates creating a key vault with public network access initially, then enabling the firewall with trusted services bypass. This approach is for illustrative purposes only. In production environments, you should create and manage your key vault as private from the start. For guidance on managing private key vaults, see [Azure Key Vault network security](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/network-security).

Create a key vault with Azure RBAC enabled.

`export KEY_VAULT_NAME="<your-key-vault-name>" az keyvault create \ --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-rbac-authorization true \ --public-network-access Enabled # Get the key vault resource ID export KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault show --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself the Key Vault Crypto Officer role to create a key.

`az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" \ --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) \ --assignee-principal-type "User" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Create a key in the key vault.

`export KEY_NAME="<your-key-name>" az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME # Get the key ID (without version for automatic rotation) export KEY_ID=$(az keyvault key show --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --query 'key.kid' -o tsv) export KEY_ID_NO_VERSION=$(echo $KEY_ID | sed 's|/[^/]*$||')`

Enable the key vault firewall with trusted services bypass.

`az keyvault update \ --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --default-action Deny \ --bypass AzureServices`

The

`--default-action Deny`

parameter blocks public network access, and the`--bypass AzureServices`

parameter allows trusted Azure services (including AKS) to access the key vault.

### Create a user-assigned managed identity

Create a user-assigned managed identity for the cluster.

`export IDENTITY_NAME="<your-identity-name>" az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP # Get the identity details export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv)`

Assign the required roles to the managed identity.

`# Assign Key Vault Crypto User role for encrypt/decrypt operations az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Crypto User" \ --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID # Assign Key Vault Contributor role for key management az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Contributor" \ --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


### Create a new AKS cluster with customer-managed keys (private)

Create a new AKS cluster with KMS encryption using customer-managed keys with a private key vault.

```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kubernetes-version 1.33.0 \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--enable-azure-keyvault-kms \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID_NO_VERSION \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access Private \
--assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Enable customer-managed keys on an existing cluster (private)

Enable KMS encryption with customer-managed keys using a private key vault on an existing AKS cluster.

Note

The cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--enable-azure-keyvault-kms \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID_NO_VERSION \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access Private \
--assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID
```


### Verify KMS configuration

After enabling KMS encryption, verify the configuration.

```
az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'securityProfile'
```


The output includes the KMS configuration:

```
{
"azureKeyVaultKms": {
"enabled": true,
"keyId": "https://<key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/<key-name>",
"keyVaultNetworkAccess": "Private",
"keyVaultResourceId": "<key-vault-resource-id>"
},
"kubernetesResourceObjectEncryptionProfile": {
"infrastructureEncryption": "Enabled"
}
}
```


## Enable customer-managed key encryption with a public key vault

With customer-managed keys, you create and manage your own Azure Key Vault and encryption keys. This section shows how to configure customer-managed keys with a public key vault.

### Create a key vault and key

Create a key vault with Azure RBAC enabled.

`export KEY_VAULT_NAME="<your-key-vault-name>" az keyvault create \ --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-rbac-authorization true \ --public-network-access Enabled # Get the key vault resource ID export KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault show --name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself the Key Vault Crypto Officer role to create a key.

`az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Crypto Officer" \ --assignee-object-id $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) \ --assignee-principal-type "User" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

Create a key in the key vault.

`export KEY_NAME="<your-key-name>" az keyvault key create --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME # Get the key ID (without version for automatic rotation) export KEY_ID=$(az keyvault key show --name $KEY_NAME --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --query 'key.kid' -o tsv) export KEY_ID_NO_VERSION=$(echo $KEY_ID | sed 's|/[^/]*$||')`


### Create a user-assigned managed identity

Create a user-assigned managed identity for the cluster.

`export IDENTITY_NAME="<your-identity-name>" az identity create --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP # Get the identity details export IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'principalId' -o tsv) export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show --name $IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'id' -o tsv)`

Assign the required roles to the managed identity.

`# Assign Key Vault Crypto User role for encrypt/decrypt operations az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Crypto User" \ --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID # Assign Key Vault Contributor role for key management az role assignment create \ --role "Key Vault Contributor" \ --assignee-object-id $IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type "ServicePrincipal" \ --scope $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`


### Create a new AKS cluster with customer-managed keys

Create a new AKS cluster with KMS encryption using customer-managed keys.

```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kubernetes-version 1.33.0 \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--enable-azure-keyvault-kms \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID_NO_VERSION \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access Public \
--assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Enable customer-managed keys on an existing cluster

Enable KMS encryption with customer-managed keys on an existing AKS cluster.

Note

The cluster must be running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--enable-azure-keyvault-kms \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID_NO_VERSION \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access Public \
--assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID
```


### Verify KMS configuration

After enabling KMS encryption, verify the configuration.

```
az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'securityProfile'
```


The output includes the KMS configuration:

```
{
"azureKeyVaultKms": {
"enabled": true,
"keyId": "https://<key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/<key-name>",
"keyVaultNetworkAccess": "Public",
"keyVaultResourceId": "<key-vault-resource-id>"
},
"kubernetesResourceObjectEncryptionProfile": {
"infrastructureEncryption": "Enabled"
}
}
```


## Migrate between key management options

You can migrate between platform-managed keys and customer-managed keys.

### Migrate from platform-managed keys to customer-managed keys

To migrate from platform-managed keys to customer-managed keys, first set up the key vault, key, and managed identity as described in the customer-managed keys section, then run the update command:

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--enable-azure-keyvault-kms \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID_NO_VERSION \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID \
--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access Public \
--assign-identity $IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID
```


### Migrate from customer-managed keys to platform-managed keys

To migrate from customer-managed keys to platform-managed keys:

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--kms-infrastructure-encryption Enabled \
--disable-azure-keyvault-kms
```


## Key rotation

With KMS data encryption, key rotation is handled differently depending on your key management option:

**Platform-managed keys**: Key rotation is automatic. No action is required.**Customer-managed keys**: When you rotate the key version in Azure Key Vault, the KMS controller detects the rotation periodically (every 6 hours) and uses the new key version.

Note

Unlike the legacy KMS experience, with this new implementation you don't need to manually re-encrypt secrets after key rotation. The platform handles this automatically.

# Use Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS supports [Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-news-and-best/windows-server-annual-channel-for-containers/ba-p/3866248) in public preview. Each channel version is released annually and is supported for *two years*. This channel is beneficial if you require increased innovation cycles and portability.

Windows Server Annual Channel versions are based on the Kubernetes version of your node pool. To upgrade from one Annual Channel version to the next, you can [upgrade to a Kubernetes version](upgrade-aks-cluster) that supports the next Annual Channel version.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Supported Annual Channel releases

AKS releases support for new releases of Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers in alignment with Kubernetes versions. For the latest updates, see the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). The following table provides an *estimated* release schedule for upcoming Annual Channel releases:

| K8s version | Annual Channel (host) version | Container image supported | End of support date |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.28 | 23H2 (preview only) | Windows Server 2022 | End of 1.33 support |
| 1.34 | 24H2 | Windows Server 2022 & Windows Server 2025 | End of 1.35 support |

## Windows Server Annual Channel vs. Long Term Servicing Channel Releases (LTSC)

AKS supports Long Term Servicing Channel Releases (LTSC), including Windows Server 2025, Windows Server 2022, and Windows Server 2019. These come from a different release channel than Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers. To view our current recommendations, see the [Windows best practices documentation](windows-best-practices).

Note

[Windows Server 2019 retires on March 1, 2026](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2019 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2019 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2019 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.33 and above. Starting on April 1, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail.[Windows Server 2022 retires on March 15, 2027](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2022 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2022 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2022 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.36 and above. Starting on April 1, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail.

For more information, see [AKS release notes][aks-release-notes]. To stay up to date on the latest Windows Server OS versions and learn more about our roadmap of what's planned for support on AKS, see our [AKS public roadmap](https://github.com/azure/aks/projects/1).

The following table compares Windows Server Annual Channel and Long Term Servicing Channel releases:

| Channel | Support | Upgrades |
|---|---|---|
| Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) | LTSC channels are released every three years and are supported for five years. This channel is recommended for customers using Long Term Support. | To upgrade from one release to the next, you need to migrate your node pools to a new OS SKU option and rebuild your container images with the new OS version. |
| Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers | Annual Channel releases occur annually and are supported for two years. | To upgrade to the latest release, you can upgrade the Kubernetes version of your node pool. |

## Before you begin

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.56.0 or later installed and configured to set
`os-sku`

to`WindowsAnnual`

with the`az aks nodepool add`

command. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Limitations

- Windows Server Annual Channel doesn't support Azure Network Policy Manager.

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `AKSWindowsAnnualPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`AKSWindowsAnnualPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AKSWindowsAnnualPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AKSWindowsAnnualPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Use Windows Server Annual Channel for Containers on AKS

To use Windows Server Annual Channel on AKS, specify the following parameters:

`os-type`

set to`Windows`

`os-sku`

set to`WindowsAnnual`


Windows Server Annual Channel versions are based on the Kubernetes version of your node pool. To check which release you'll get based on the Kubernetes version of your node pool, see the [supported Annual Channel releases](#supported-annual-channel-releases).

### Create a new Windows Server Annual Channel node pool

Create a Windows Server Annual Channel node pool using the

command. The following example creates a Windows Server Annual Channel node pool with the 23H2 release:`az aks nodepool add`

`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --os-type Windows \ --os-sku WindowsAnnual \ --kubernetes-version 1.29 --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1`

Note

If you don't specify the Kubernetes version during node pool creation, AKS uses the same Kubernetes version as your cluster.


### Verify Windows Server Annual Channel node pool creation

Verify Windows Server Annual Channel node pool creation by checking the OS SKU of your node pool using

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_POOL_NAME`

If you successfully created a Windows Server Annual Channel node pool, you should see the following output:

`Name: npwin Roles: agent Labels: agentpool=npwin ... kubernetes.azure.com/os=windows ... kubernetes.azure.com/node-image-version=AKSWindows-23H2-gen2 ... kubernetes.azure.com/os-sku=WindowsAnnual`


### Upgrade an existing node pool to Windows Server Annual Channel

You can upgrade an existing node pool from an LTSC release to Windows Server Annual Channel by following the guidance in [Upgrade the OS version for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Windows workloads](upgrade-windows-os).

To upgrade from one Annual Channel version to the next, you can [upgrade to a Kubernetes version](upgrade-aks-cluster) that supports the next Annual Channel version.

# Use OpenFaaS on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) is a framework that uses containers to build serverless functions. As an open source project, it has gained large-scale adoption within the community. This document details installing and using OpenFaas on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see
[Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-clusters-workloads). - You need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - You need an AKS cluster. If you don't have an existing cluster, you can create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need to install the OpenFaaS CLI. For installation options, see the
[OpenFaaS CLI documentation](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli).

## Add the OpenFaaS helm chart repo

Navigate to

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).Add the OpenFaaS helm chart repo and update to the latest version using the following

`helm`

commands.`helm repo add openfaas https://openfaas.github.io/faas-netes/ helm repo update`


## Deploy OpenFaaS

As a good practice, OpenFaaS and OpenFaaS functions should be stored in their own Kubernetes namespace.

Create a namespace for the OpenFaaS system and functions using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faas-netes/master/namespaces.yml`

Generate a password for the OpenFaaS UI Portal and REST API using the following commands. The helm chart uses this password to enable basic authentication on the OpenFaaS Gateway, which is exposed to the Internet through a cloud LoadBalancer.

`# generate a random password PASSWORD=$(head -c 12 /dev/urandom | shasum| cut -d' ' -f1) kubectl -n openfaas create secret generic basic-auth \ --from-literal=basic-auth-user=admin \ --from-literal=basic-auth-password="$PASSWORD"`

Important

Using a username and password for authentication is an insecure pattern. If you have an OpenFaaS enterprise license, we recommend using

[Identity and Access Management (IAM) for OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/blog/walkthrough-iam-for-openfaas/)instead.Get the value for your password using the following

`echo`

command.`echo $PASSWORD`

Deploy OpenFaaS into your AKS cluster using the

`helm upgrade`

command.`helm upgrade openfaas --install openfaas/openfaas \ --namespace openfaas \ --set basic_auth=true \ --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \ --set serviceType=LoadBalancer`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`NAME: openfaas LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Aug 29 08:26:11 2023 NAMESPACE: openfaas STATUS: deployed ... NOTES: To verify that openfaas has started, run: kubectl --namespace=openfaas get deployments -l "release=openfaas, app=openfaas" ...`

A public IP address is created for accessing the OpenFaaS gateway. Get the IP address using the

command.`kubectl get service`

`kubectl get service -l component=gateway --namespace openfaas`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE gateway ClusterIP 10.0.156.194 <none> 8080/TCP 7m gateway-external LoadBalancer 10.0.28.18 52.186.64.52 8080:30800/TCP 7m`

Test the OpenFaaS system by browsing to the external IP address on port 8080,

`http://52.186.64.52:8080`

in this example, where you're prompted to log in. The default user is`admin`

and your password can be retrieved using`echo $PASSWORD`

.Set

`$OPENFAAS_URL`

to the URL of the external IP address on port 8080 and log in with the Azure CLI using the following commands.`export OPENFAAS_URL=http://52.186.64.52:8080 echo -n $PASSWORD | ./faas-cli login -g $OPENFAAS_URL -u admin --password-stdin`


## Create first function

Navigate to the OpenFaaS system using your OpenFaaS URL.

Create a function using the OpenFaas portal by selecting

**Deploy A New Function**and search for**Figlet**.Select the

**Figlet**function, and then select**Deploy**.Invoke the function using the following

`curl`

command. Make sure you replace the IP address in the following example with your OpenFaaS gateway address.`curl -X POST http://52.186.64.52:8080/function/figlet -d "Hello Azure"`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`_ _ _ _ _ | | | | ___| | | ___ / \ _____ _ _ __ ___ | |_| |/ _ \ | |/ _ \ / _ \ |_ / | | | '__/ _ \ | _ | __/ | | (_) | / ___ \ / /| |_| | | | __/ |_| |_|\___|_|_|\___/ /_/ \_\/___|\__,_|_| \___|`


## Create second function

### Configure your Azure Cosmos DB instance

Navigate to

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).Create a new resource group for the Azure Cosmos DB instance using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name serverless-backing --location eastus`

Deploy an Azure Cosmos DB instance of kind

`MongoDB`

using thecommand. Replace`az cosmosdb create`

`openfaas-cosmos`

with your own unique instance name.`az cosmosdb create --resource-group serverless-backing --name openfaas-cosmos --kind MongoDB`

Get the Azure Cosmos DB database connection string and store it in a variable using the

command. Make sure you replace the value for the`az cosmosdb keys list`

`--resource-group`

argument with the name of your resource group, and the`--name`

argument with the name of your Azure Cosmos DB instance.`COSMOS=$(az cosmosdb keys list \ --type connection-strings \ --resource-group serverless-backing \ --name openfaas-cosmos \ --output tsv)`

Populate the Azure Cosmos DB with test data by creating a file named

`plans.json`

and copying in the following json.`{ "name" : "two_person", "friendlyName" : "Two Person Plan", "portionSize" : "1-2 Person", "mealsPerWeek" : "3 Unique meals per week", "price" : 72, "description" : "Our basic plan, delivering 3 meals per week, which will feed 1-2 people.", "__v" : 0 }`


### Create the function

Install the MongoDB tools. The following example command installs these tools using brew. For more installation options, see the

[MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).`brew install mongodb`

Load the Azure Cosmos DB instance with data using the

*mongoimport*tool.`mongoimport --uri=$COSMOS -c plans < plans.json`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`2018-02-19T14:42:14.313+0000 connected to: localhost 2018-02-19T14:42:14.918+0000 imported 1 document`

Create the function using the

`faas-cli deploy`

command. Make sure you update the value of the`-g`

argument with your OpenFaaS gateway address.`faas-cli deploy -g http://52.186.64.52:8080 --image=shanepeckham/openfaascosmos --name=cosmos-query --env=NODE_ENV=$COSMOS`

Once deployed, your output should look similar to the following example output:

`Deployed. 202 Accepted. URL: http://52.186.64.52:8080/function/cosmos-query`

Test the function using the following

`curl`

command. Make sure you update the IP address with the OpenFaaS gateway address.`curl -s http://52.186.64.52:8080/function/cosmos-query`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`[{"ID":"","Name":"two_person","FriendlyName":"","PortionSize":"","MealsPerWeek":"","Price":72,"Description":"Our basic plan, delivering 3 meals per week, which will feed 1-2 people."}]`

Note

You can also test the function within the OpenFaaS UI:

# Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in AKS (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) primitives to associate [managed identities for Azure resources](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and identities in Microsoft Entra ID with pods. Administrators create identities and bindings as Kubernetes primitives that allow pods to access Azure resources that rely on Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider.

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in AKS have the following limitations:

- Each cluster supports up to 200 pod-managed identities.
- Each cluster supports up to 200 pod-managed identity exceptions.
- Pod-managed identities are supported only on Linux node pools.
- This feature is supported only on clusters backed by Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

Important

We recommend you review [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview). This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service was deprecated on October 24, 2022, and the project archived in September 2023. For more information, see the [deprecation notice](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity#-announcement). The AKS Pod Identity Managed add-on is patched and supported through September 2025 to allow time for customers to move over to [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview).

## Operation mode options

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity supports two modes of operation:

**Standard Mode**: In this mode, the following two components are deployed to the AKS cluster:[Managed Identity Controller (MIC)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/mic/): An MIC is a Kubernetes controller that watches for changes to pods,[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/), and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)through the Kubernetes API Server. When it detects a relevant change, the MIC adds or deletes[AzureAssignedIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureassignedidentity/)as needed. Specifically, when a pod is scheduled, the MIC assigns the managed identity on Azure to the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Set used by the node pool during the creation phase. When all pods using the identity are deleted, it removes the identity from the Virtual Machine Scale Set of the node pool, unless the same managed identity is used by other pods. The MIC takes similar actions when AzureIdentity or AzureIdentityBinding are created or deleted.[Node Managed Identity (NMI)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/): NMI is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. NMI intercepts security token requests to the[Azure Instance Metadata Service](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/instance-metadata-service?tabs=linux)on each node. NMI intercepts token requests and redirects them to itself. It then checks if the pod is authorized to access the requested identity and, if so, retrieves the token from the Microsoft Entra tenant on behalf of the application.

**Managed Mode**: This mode offers only NMI. When installed via the AKS cluster add-on, Azure manages creation of Kubernetes primitives (AzureIdentity and AzureIdentityBinding) and identity assignment in response to CLI commands by the user. Otherwise, if installed via Helm chart, the identity needs to be manually assigned and managed per the user. For more information, see[Pod identity in managed mode](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/configure/pod_identity_in_managed_mode/).

When you install the Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity via Helm chart or YAML manifest as shown in the [Installation Guide](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/installation/), you can choose between the `standard`

and `managed`

mode. If you instead decide to install the
Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity using the AKS cluster add-on as shown in this article, the setup uses the `managed`

mode.

## Prerequisites

Your Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in AKS must meet the following requirements:

The Azure CLI version 2.20.0 or later is installed.

Your AKS cluster is at version 1.26 or later.

You must have the appropriate permissions such as the

**Owner**or**Contributor**role.

## Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

To install the aks-preview extension, run the following command:

```
az extension add --name aks-preview
```


Run the following command to update to the latest version of the extension released:

```
az extension update --name aks-preview
```


## Register the EnablePodIdentityPreview feature flag

Register the `EnablePodIdentityPreview`

feature flag by using the [az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command as shown in the following example:

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnablePodIdentityPreview"
```


Tip

To disable the AKS Managed add-on, run the following command:

```
az feature unregister --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnablePodIdentityPreview"
```


It takes a few minutes for the status to show as *Registered*. Verify the registration status by using the [az feature show](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-show) command:

```
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnablePodIdentityPreview"
```


When the status reflects *Registered*, refresh the registration of the *Microsoft.ContainerService* resource provider by using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```


## Manage an AKS cluster with pod-managed identities

You can manage your AKS cluster with either the Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) or Kubenet network plugin when enabling Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities.

Create an AKS cluster with Azure CNI and pod-managed identity enabled with the default recommended configuration. The following commands use

[az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create)to create a resource group named*myResourceGroup*and thecommand to create an AKS cluster named`az aks create`

*myAKSCluster*in the*myResourceGroup*resource group.`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-pod-identity \ --network-plugin azure \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Use

to sign in to your AKS cluster. This command also downloads and configures the`az aks get-credentials`

`kubectl`

client certificate on your development computer.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


When you enable pod-managed identity on your AKS cluster, the system adds an `AzurePodIdentityException`

named *aks-addon-exception* to the *kube-system* namespace. An `AzurePodIdentityException`

lets pods with certain labels access the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoint without interception by the NMI server. The *aks-addon-exception* allows AKS first-party addons, such as Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity, to operate without requiring you to manually configure an `AzurePodIdentityException`

. Optionally, you can add, remove, and update an `AzurePodIdentityException`

using:

`az aks pod-identity exception add`

`az aks pod-identity exception delete`

`az aks pod-identity exception update`

Or

`kubectl`


## Update an existing AKS cluster with Azure CNI

To update an existing AKS cluster with Azure CNI to include pod-managed identity, run the following command:

```
az aks update --resource-group $MY_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $MY_CLUSTER --enable-pod-identity
```


## Create a managed identity

You must have the relevant permissions (for example, **Owner**) on your subscription to create the identity.

To create an identity to be used by the demo pod with [az identity create](/en-us/cli/azure/identity#az-identity-create), set the *IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID* and *IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID* variables, run the following command:

```
az group create --name myIdentityResourceGroup --location eastus
export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP="myIdentityResourceGroup"
export IDENTITY_NAME="application-identity"
az identity create --resource-group ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${IDENTITY_NAME}
export IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${IDENTITY_NAME} --query clientId -o tsv)"
export IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${IDENTITY_NAME} --query id -o tsv)"
```


## Assign permissions for the managed identity

The managed identity assigned to the pod must be granted appropriate permissions based on the operations the pod performs. Ensure that you assign only the minimum required roles to follow security best practices.

To run the demo, the *IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID* managed identity must have **Virtual Machine Contributor** permissions in the resource group that contains the Virtual Machine Scale Set of your AKS cluster.

```
# Obtain the name of the resource group containing the Virtual Machine Scale set of your AKS cluster, commonly called the node resource group
NODE_GROUP=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)
# Obtain the id of the node resource group
NODES_RESOURCE_ID=$(az group show --name $NODE_GROUP -o tsv --query "id")
# Create a role assignment granting your managed identity permissions on the node resource group
az role assignment create --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --assignee "$IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID" --scope $NODES_RESOURCE_ID
```


## Create a pod-managed identity

To create a pod-managed identity for the cluster using `az aks pod-identity add`

, run the following command:

```
export POD_IDENTITY_NAME="my-pod-identity"
export POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE="my-app"
az aks pod-identity add --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --namespace ${POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE} --name ${POD_IDENTITY_NAME} --identity-resource-id ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID}
```


Note

The "POD_IDENTITY_NAME" has to be a valid Domain Name System [(DNS) subdomain name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names) as defined in [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123).

When you assign the pod-managed identity by using `pod-identity add`

, the Azure CLI attempts to grant the Managed Identity Operator role over the pod-managed identity (*IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID*) to the cluster identity.

Azure creates an AzureIdentity resource in your cluster representing the identity in Azure, and an AzureIdentityBinding resource that connects the AzureIdentity to a selector. You can view these resources by running the following command:

```
kubectl get azureidentity -n $POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE
kubectl get azureidentitybinding -n $POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE
```


## Run a sample application

For a pod to use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity, the pod needs an *aadpodidbinding* label with a value that matches a selector from a *AzureIdentityBinding*. By default, the selector matches the name of the pod-managed identity, but it can also be set using the `--binding-selector`

option when calling `az aks pod-identity add`

.

To run a sample application using Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity, create a `demo.yaml`

file with the following contents. Replace *POD_IDENTITY_NAME*, *IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID*, and *IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP* with the values from the previous steps. Replace *SUBSCRIPTION_ID* with your subscription ID.

Note

In the previous steps, you created the *POD_IDENTITY_NAME*, *IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID*, and *IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP* variables. You can use a command such as `echo`

to display the value you set for variables, for example `echo $POD_IDENTITY_NAME`

.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: demo
labels:
aadpodidbinding: $POD_IDENTITY_NAME
spec:
containers:
- name: demo
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/aad-pod-identity/demo:v1.6.3
args:
- --subscriptionid=$SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- --clientid=$IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID
- --resourcegroup=$IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP
env:
- name: MY_POD_NAME
valueFrom:
fieldRef:
fieldPath: metadata.name
- name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
valueFrom:
fieldRef:
fieldPath: metadata.namespace
- name: MY_POD_IP
valueFrom:
fieldRef:
fieldPath: status.podIP
nodeSelector:
kubernetes.io/os: linux
```


Notice the pod definition has an `aadpodidbinding`

label with a value that matches the name of the pod-managed identity you ran `az aks pod-identity add`

in the previous step.

Deploy the

`demo.yaml`

to the same namespace as your pod-managed identity using`kubectl apply`

:`kubectl apply -f demo.yaml --namespace $POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE`

Verify the sample application successfully runs using

`kubectl logs`

:`kubectl logs demo --follow --namespace $POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE`

Verify that the logs show a token is successfully acquired and that the HTTP

*GET*request operation is successful.`... successfully doARMOperations vm count 0 successfully acquired a token using the MSI, msiEndpoint(http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token) successfully acquired a token, userAssignedID MSI, msiEndpoint(http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token) clientID(xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) successfully made GET on instance metadata ...`


## Run an application with multiple identities

To enable an application to use multiple identities, set the `--binding-selector`

to the same selector when creating pod identities:

```
az aks pod-identity add --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --namespace ${POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE} --name ${POD_IDENTITY_NAME_1} --identity-resource-id ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID_1} --binding-selector myMultiIdentitySelector
az aks pod-identity add --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --namespace ${POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE} --name ${POD_IDENTITY_NAME_2} --identity-resource-id ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID_2} --binding-selector myMultiIdentitySelector
```


Then set the `aadpodidbinding`

field in your pod YAML to the binding selector you specified.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: demo
labels:
aadpodidbinding: myMultiIdentitySelector
...
```


## Disable pod-managed identity on an existing cluster

To disable pod-managed identity on an existing cluster, remove the pod-managed identities from the cluster by running the following command:

`az aks pod-identity delete --name ${POD_IDENTITY_NAME} --namespace ${POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE} --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster`

Then disable the feature on the cluster by running the following command:

`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --disable-pod-identity`


## Clean up resources

To remove a Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity from your cluster, remove the sample application and the pod-managed identity from the cluster.

```
kubectl delete pod demo --namespace $POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE
```


Then remove the identity and the role assignment of cluster identity.

```
az aks pod-identity delete \
--name ${POD_IDENTITY_NAME} \
--namespace ${POD_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE} \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster
az identity delete \
--resource-group ${IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
--name ${IDENTITY_NAME}
az role assignment delete \
--role "Managed Identity Operator" \
--assignee "$IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID" \
--scope "$IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID"
```

# Provision Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

After you [configure Azure NetApp Files for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files), you can provision Azure NetApp Files volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service.

Azure NetApp Files supports volumes using NFS (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), [SMB](azure-netapp-files-smb), or [dual-protocol](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol) (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB).

- This article describes details for provisioning NFS volumes statically or dynamically.
- For information about provisioning SMB volumes statically or dynamically, see
[Provision Azure NetApp Files SMB volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-smb). - For information about provisioning dual-protocol volumes statically, see
[Provision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol)

## Statically configure for applications that use NFS volumes

This section describes how to create an NFS volume on Azure NetApp Files and expose the volume statically to Kubernetes. It also describes how to use the volume with a containerized application.

### Create an NFS volume

Define variables for later usage. Replace

*myresourcegroup*,*mylocation*,*myaccountname*,*mypool1*,*premium*,*myfilepath*,*myvolsize*,*myvolname*,*vnetid*, and*anfSubnetID*with an appropriate value from your account and environment. The*filepath*must be unique within all ANF accounts.`RESOURCE_GROUP="myresourcegroup" LOCATION="mylocation" ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME="myaccountname" POOL_NAME="mypool1" SERVICE_LEVEL="premium" # Valid values are Standard, Premium, and Ultra UNIQUE_FILE_PATH="myfilepath" VOLUME_SIZE_GIB="myvolsize" VOLUME_NAME="myvolname" VNET_ID="vnetId" SUBNET_ID="anfSubnetId"`

Create a volume using the

command. For more information, see`az netappfiles volume create`

[Create an NFS volume for Azure NetApp Files](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-volumes).`az netappfiles volume create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --location $LOCATION \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --pool-name $POOL_NAME \ --name "$VOLUME_NAME" \ --service-level $SERVICE_LEVEL \ --vnet $VNET_ID \ --subnet $SUBNET_ID \ --usage-threshold $VOLUME_SIZE_GIB \ --file-path $UNIQUE_FILE_PATH \ --protocol-types NFSv3`


### Create the persistent volume

List the details of your volume using

command. Replace the variables with appropriate values from your Azure NetApp Files account and environment if not defined in a previous step.`az netappfiles volume show`

`az netappfiles volume show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --pool-name $POOL_NAME \ --volume-name "$VOLUME_NAME -o JSON`

The following output is an example of the above command executed with real values.

`{ ... "creationToken": "myfilepath2", ... "mountTargets": [ { ... "ipAddress": "10.0.0.4", ... } ], ... }`

Create a file named

`pv-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Make sure the server matches the output IP address from Step 1, and the path matches the output from`creationToken`

above. The capacity must also match the volume size from the step above.`apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: pv-nfs spec: capacity: storage: 100Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteMany mountOptions: - vers=3 nfs: server: 10.0.0.4 path: /myfilepath2`

Create the persistent volume using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f pv-nfs.yaml`

Verify the status of the persistent volume is

*Available*by using thecommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pv pv-nfs`


### Create a persistent volume claim

Create a file named

`pvc-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This manifest creates a PVC named`pvc-nfs`

for 100Gi storage and`ReadWriteMany`

access mode, matching the PV you created.`apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc-nfs spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany storageClassName: "" resources: requests: storage: 100Gi`

Create the persistent volume claim using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f pvc-nfs.yaml`

Verify the

*Status*of the persistent volume claim is*Bound*by using thecommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pvc pvc-nfs`


### Mount with a pod

Create a file named

`nginx-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This manifest defines a`nginx`

pod that uses the persistent volume claim.`kind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: nginx-nfs spec: containers: - image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine name: nginx-nfs command: - "/bin/sh" - "-c" - while true; do echo $(date) >> /mnt/azure/outfile; sleep 1; done volumeMounts: - name: disk01 mountPath: /mnt/azure volumes: - name: disk01 persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc-nfs`

Create the pod using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-nfs.yaml`

Verify the pod is

*Running*by using thecommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pod nginx-nfs`

Verify your volume has been mounted on the pod by using

to connect to the pod, and then use`kubectl exec`

`df -h`

to check if the volume is mounted.`kubectl exec -it nginx-nfs -- sh`

`/ # df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on ... 10.0.0.4:/myfilepath2 100T 384K 100T 1% /mnt/azure ...`


## Dynamically configure for applications that use NFS volumes

Trident may be used to dynamically provision NFS or SMB files on Azure NetApp Files. Dynamically provisioned SMB volumes are only supported with windows worker nodes.

This section describes how to use Trident to dynamically create an NFS volume on Azure NetApp Files and automatically mount it to a containerized application.

### Install Trident

To dynamically provision NFS volumes, you need to install Trident. Trident is NetApp's dynamic storage provisioner that is purpose-built for Kubernetes. Simplify the consumption of storage for Kubernetes applications using Trident's industry-standard [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) driver. Trident deploys on Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads.

Trident can be installed using the Trident operator (manually or using [Helm](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html)) or [ tridentctl](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-tridentctl.html). To learn more about these installation methods and how they work, see the

[Trident Install Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html).

#### Install Trident using Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be installed on your workstation to install Trident using this method. For other methods of installing Trident, see the [Trident Install Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html).

To install Trident using Helm for a cluster with only Linux worker nodes, run the following commands:

`helm repo add netapp-trident https://netapp.github.io/trident-helm-chart helm install trident netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 23.04.0 --create-namespace --namespace trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`NAME: trident LAST DEPLOYED: Fri May 5 13:55:36 2023 NAMESPACE: trident STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: Thank you for installing trident-operator, which will deploy and manage NetApp's Trident CSI storage provisioner for Kubernetes. Your release is named 'trident' and is installed into the 'trident' namespace. Please note that there must be only one instance of Trident (and trident-operator) in a Kubernetes cluster. To configure Trident to manage storage resources, you will need a copy of tridentctl, which is available in pre-packaged Trident releases. You may find all Trident releases and source code online at https://github.com/NetApp/trident. To learn more about the release, try: $ helm status trident $ helm get all trident`

To confirm Trident was installed successfully, run the following

command:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe torc trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Name: trident Namespace: Labels: app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm Annotations: meta.helm.sh/release-name: trident meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: trident API Version: trident.netapp.io/v1 Kind: TridentOrchestrator Metadata: ...

### Create a backend

To instruct Trident about the Azure NetApp Files subscription and where it needs to create volumes, a backend is created. This step requires details about the account that was created in a previous step.

Create a file named

`backend-secret.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Change the`Client ID`

and`clientSecret`

to the correct values for your environment.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: backend-tbc-anf-secret type: Opaque stringData: clientID: 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444 clientSecret: rR0rUmWXfNioN1KhtHisiSAnoTherboGuskey6pU`

Create a file named

`backend-anf.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Change the`subscriptionID`

,`tenantID`

,`location`

, and`serviceLevel`

to the correct values for your environment. Use the`subscriptionID`

for the Azure subscription where Azure NetApp Files is enabled. Obtain the`tenantID`

,`clientID`

, and`clientSecret`

from an[application registration](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)in Microsoft Entra ID with sufficient permissions for the Azure NetApp Files service. The application registration includes the Owner or Contributor role predefined by Azure. The location must be an Azure location that contains at least one delegated subnet created in a previous step. The`serviceLevel`

must match the`serviceLevel`

configured for the capacity pool in[Configure Azure NetApp Files for AKS workloads](azure-netapp-files#configure-azure-netapp-files-for-aks-workloads).`apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1 kind: TridentBackendConfig metadata: name: backend-tbc-anf spec: version: 1 storageDriverName: azure-netapp-files subscriptionID: aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e tenantID: aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee location: eastus serviceLevel: Premium credentials: name: backend-tbc-anf-secret`

For more information about backends, see

[Azure NetApp Files backend configuration options and examples](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/anf-examples.html).Apply the secret and backend using the

command. First apply the secret:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f backend-secret.yaml -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`secret/backend-tbc-anf-secret created`

Apply the backend:

`kubectl apply -f backend-anf.yaml -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`tridentbackendconfig.trident.netapp.io/backend-tbc-anf created`

Confirm the backend was created by using the

command:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get tridentbackends -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`NAME BACKEND BACKEND UUID tbe-kfrdh backend-tbc-anf 8da4e926-9dd4-4a40-8d6a-375aab28c566`


### Create a storage class

A storage class is used to define how a unit of storage is dynamically created with a persistent volume. To consume Azure NetApp Files volumes, a storage class must be created.

Create a file named

`anf-storageclass.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 kind: StorageClass metadata: name: azure-netapp-files provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io parameters: backendType: "azure-netapp-files" fsType: "nfs"`

Create the storage class using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-storageclass.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`storageclass/azure-netapp-files created`

Run the

command to view the status of the storage class:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get sc NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE azure-netapp-files csi.trident.netapp.io Delete Immediate false`


### Create a PVC

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. Upon the creation of a persistent volume claim, Trident automatically creates an Azure NetApp Files volume and makes it available for Kubernetes workloads to consume.

Create a file named

`anf-pvc.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. In this example, a 1-TiB volume is needed with ReadWriteMany access.`kind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: anf-pvc spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 1Ti storageClassName: azure-netapp-files`

Create the persistent volume claim with the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-pvc.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`persistentvolumeclaim/anf-pvc created`

To view information about the persistent volume claim, run the

command:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pvc`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`kubectl get pvc -n trident NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE anf-pvc Bound pvc-bffa315d-3f44-4770-86eb-c922f567a075 1Ti RWO azure-netapp-files 62s`


### Use the persistent volume

After the PVC is created, Trident creates the persistent volume. A pod can be spun up to mount and access the Azure NetApp Files volume.

The following manifest can be used to define an NGINX pod that mounts the Azure NetApp Files volume created in the previous step. In this example, the volume is mounted at `/mnt/data`

.

Create a file named

`anf-nginx-pod.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`kind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: nginx-pod spec: containers: - name: nginx image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 128Mi limits: cpu: 250m memory: 256Mi volumeMounts: - mountPath: "/mnt/data" name: volume volumes: - name: volume persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: anf-pvc`

Create the pod using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-nginx-pod.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`pod/nginx-pod created`

Kubernetes has created a pod with the volume mounted and accessible within the

`nginx`

container at`/mnt/data`

. You can confirm by checking the event logs for the pod usingcommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pod nginx-pod`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`[...] Volumes: volume: Type: PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace) ClaimName: anf-pvc ReadOnly: false default-token-k7952: Type: Secret (a volume populated by a Secret) SecretName: default-token-k7952 Optional: false [...] Events: Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal Scheduled 15s default-scheduler Successfully assigned trident/nginx-pod to brameshb-non-root-test Normal SuccessfulAttachVolume 15s attachdetach-controller AttachVolume.Attach succeeded for volume "pvc-bffa315d-3f44-4770-86eb-c922f567a075" Normal Pulled 12s kubelet Container image "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine" already present on machine Normal Created 11s kubelet Created container nginx Normal Started 10s kubelet Started container nginx`

# Use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The VPA automatically adjusts the CPU and memory requests for your pods to match the usage patterns of your workloads. This feature helps to optimize the performance of your applications and reduce the cost of running your workloads in AKS.

For more information, see the [Vertical Pod Autoscaler overview](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

## Before you begin

If you have an existing AKS cluster, make sure it's running Kubernetes version 1.24 or higher.

You need the Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later installed and configured. Run

`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).If enabling VPA on an existing cluster, make sure

`kubectl`

is installed and configured to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`


## Deploy the Vertical Pod Autoscaler on a new cluster

Create a new AKS cluster with the VPA enabled using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-vpa`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enable-vpa --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Update an existing cluster to use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler

Update an existing cluster to use the VPA using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-vpa`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --enable-vpa`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Disable the Vertical Pod Autoscaler on an existing cluster

Disable the VPA on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-vpa`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --disable-vpa`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Test Vertical Pod Autoscaler installation

In the following example, we create a deployment with two pods, each running a single container that requests 100 millicore and tries to utilize slightly above 500 millicores. We also create a VPA config pointing at the deployment. The VPA observes the behavior of the pods, and after about five minutes, updates the pods to request 500 millicores.

Create a file named

`hamster.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest of the Vertical Pod Autoscaler example from the[kubernetes/autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/examples/hamster.yaml)GitHub repository:`apiVersion: "autoscaling.k8s.io/v1" kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: hamster-vpa spec: targetRef: apiVersion: "apps/v1" kind: Deployment name: hamster resourcePolicy: containerPolicies: - containerName: '*' minAllowed: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi maxAllowed: cpu: 1 memory: 500Mi controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"] --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hamster spec: selector: matchLabels: app: hamster replicas: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: hamster spec: securityContext: runAsNonRoot: true runAsUser: 65534 containers: - name: hamster image: registry.k8s.io/ubuntu-slim:0.1 resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi command: ["/bin/sh"] args: - "-c" - "while true; do timeout 0.5s yes >/dev/null; sleep 0.5s; done"`

Deploy the

`hamster.yaml`

Vertical Pod Autoscaler example using thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f hamster.yaml`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

View the running pods using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pods -l app=hamster`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`hamster-78f9dcdd4c-hf7gk 1/1 Running 0 24s hamster-78f9dcdd4c-j9mc7 1/1 Running 0 24s`

View the CPU and Memory reservations on one of the pods using the

command. Make sure you replace`kubectl describe`

`<example-pod>`

with one of the pod IDs returned in your output from the previous step.`kubectl describe pod hamster-<example-pod>`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`hamster: Container ID: containerd:// Image: k8s.gcr.io/ubuntu-slim:0.1 Image ID: sha256: Port: <none> Host Port: <none> Command: /bin/sh Args: -c while true; do timeout 0.5s yes >/dev/null; sleep 0.5s; done State: Running Started: Wed, 28 Sep 2022 15:06:14 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Requests: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi Environment: <none>`

The pod has 100 millicpu and 50 Mibibytes of Memory reserved in this example. For this sample application, the pod needs less than 100 millicpu to run, so there's no CPU capacity available. The pods also reserves less memory than needed. The Vertical Pod Autoscaler

*vpa-recommender*deployment analyzes the pods hosting the hamster application to see if the CPU and Memory requirements are appropriate. If adjustments are needed, the vpa-updater relaunches the pods with updated values.Monitor the pods using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get --watch pods -l app=hamster`

When the new hamster pod starts, you can view the updated CPU and Memory reservations using the

command. Make sure you replace`kubectl describe`

`<example-pod>`

with one of the pod IDs returned in your output from the previous step.`kubectl describe pod hamster-<example-pod>`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`State: Running Started: Wed, 28 Sep 2022 15:09:51 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Requests: cpu: 587m memory: 262144k Environment: <none>`

In the previous output, you can see that the CPU reservation increased to 587 millicpu, which is over five times the original value. The Memory increased to 262,144 Kilobytes, which is around 250 Mibibytes, or five times the original value. This pod was under-resourced, and the Vertical Pod Autoscaler corrected the estimate with a much more appropriate value.

View updated recommendations from VPA using the

command to describe the hamster-vpa resource information.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe vpa/hamster-vpa`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`State: Running Started: Wed, 28 Sep 2022 15:09:51 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Requests: cpu: 587m memory: 262144k Environment: <none>`


## Set Vertical Pod Autoscaler requests

The `VerticalPodAutoscaler`

object automatically sets resource requests on pods with an `updateMode`

of `Auto`

. You can set a different value depending on your requirements and testing. In this example, we create and test a deployment manifest with two pods, each running a container that requests 100 milliCPU and 50 MiB of Memory, and sets the `updateMode`

to `Recreate`

.

Create a file named

`azure-autodeploy.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: vpa-auto-deployment spec: replicas: 2 selector: matchLabels: app: vpa-auto-deployment template: metadata: labels: app: vpa-auto-deployment spec: containers: - name: mycontainer image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi command: ["/bin/sh"] args: ["-c", "while true; do timeout 0.5s yes >/dev/null; sleep 0.5s; done"]`

Create the pod using the

command.`kubectl create`

`kubectl create -f azure-autodeploy.yaml`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

View the running pods using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pods`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE vpa-auto-deployment-54465fb978-kchc5 1/1 Running 0 52s vpa-auto-deployment-54465fb978-nhtmj 1/1 Running 0 52s`

Create a file named

`azure-vpa-auto.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1 kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: vpa-auto spec: targetRef: apiVersion: "apps/v1" kind: Deployment name: vpa-auto-deployment updatePolicy: updateMode: "Recreate"`

The

`targetRef.name`

value specifies that any pod controlled by a deployment named`vpa-auto-deployment`

belongs to`VerticalPodAutoscaler`

. The`updateMode`

value of`Recreate`

means that the Vertical Pod Autoscaler controller can delete a pod, adjust the CPU and Memory requests, and then create a new pod.Apply the manifest to the cluster using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl create -f azure-vpa-auto.yaml`

Wait a few minutes and then view the running pods using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pods`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE vpa-auto-deployment-54465fb978-qbhc4 1/1 Running 0 2m49s vpa-auto-deployment-54465fb978-vbj68 1/1 Running 0 109s`

Get detailed information about one of your running pods using the

command. Make sure you replace`kubectl get`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of one of your pods from your previous output.`kubectl get pod <pod-name> --output yaml`

Your output should look similar to the following example output, which shows that VPA controller increased the Memory request to 262144k and the CPU request to 25 milliCPU:

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: annotations: vpaObservedContainers: mycontainer vpaUpdates: 'Pod resources updated by vpa-auto: container 0: cpu request, memory request' creationTimestamp: "2022-09-29T16:44:37Z" generateName: vpa-auto-deployment-54465fb978- labels: app: vpa-auto-deployment spec: containers: - args: - -c - while true; do timeout 0.5s yes >/dev/null; sleep 0.5s; done command: - /bin/sh image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent name: mycontainer resources: requests: cpu: 25m memory: 262144k`

Get detailed information about the Vertical Pod Autoscaler and its recommendations for CPU and Memory using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get vpa vpa-auto --output yaml`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`recommendation: containerRecommendations: - containerName: mycontainer lowerBound: cpu: 25m memory: 262144k target: cpu: 25m memory: 262144k uncappedTarget: cpu: 25m memory: 262144k upperBound: cpu: 230m memory: 262144k`

In this example, the results in the

`target`

attribute specify that it doesn't need to change the CPU or the Memory target for the container to run optimally. However, results can vary depending on the application and its resource utilization.The Vertical Pod Autoscaler uses the

`lowerBound`

and`upperBound`

attributes to decide whether to delete a pod and replace it with a new pod. If a pod has requests less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, the Vertical Pod Autoscaler deletes the pod and replaces it with a pod that meets the target attribute.

## Extra Recommender for Vertical Pod Autoscaler

The Recommender provides recommendations for resource usage based on real-time resource consumption. AKS deploys a Recommender when a cluster enables VPA. You can deploy a customized Recommender or an extra Recommender with the same image as the default one. The benefit of having a customized Recommender is that you can customize your recommendation logic. With an extra Recommender, you can partition VPAs to use different Recommenders.

In the following example, we create an extra Recommender, apply to an existing AKS cluster, and configure the VPA object to use the extra Recommender.

Create a file named

`extra_recommender.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: extra-recommender namespace: kube-system spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: extra-recommender template: metadata: labels: app: extra-recommender spec: serviceAccountName: vpa-recommender securityContext: runAsNonRoot: true runAsUser: 65534 containers: - name: recommender image: registry.k8s.io/autoscaling/vpa-recommender:0.13.0 imagePullPolicy: Always args: - --recommender-name=extra-recommender resources: limits: cpu: 200m memory: 1000Mi requests: cpu: 50m memory: 500Mi ports: - name: prometheus containerPort: 8942`

Deploy the

`extra-recomender.yaml`

Vertical Pod Autoscaler example using thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f extra-recommender.yaml`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

Create a file named

`hamster-extra-recommender.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: "autoscaling.k8s.io/v1" kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler metadata: name: hamster-vpa spec: recommenders: - name: 'extra-recommender' targetRef: apiVersion: "apps/v1" kind: Deployment name: hamster updatePolicy: updateMode: "Auto" resourcePolicy: containerPolicies: - containerName: '*' minAllowed: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi maxAllowed: cpu: 1 memory: 500Mi controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"] --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: hamster spec: selector: matchLabels: app: hamster replicas: 2 template: metadata: labels: app: hamster spec: securityContext: runAsNonRoot: true runAsUser: 65534 # nobody containers: - name: hamster image: k8s.gcr.io/ubuntu-slim:0.1 resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 50Mi command: ["/bin/sh"] args: - "-c" - "while true; do timeout 0.5s yes >/dev/null; sleep 0.5s; done"`

If

`memory`

isn't specified in`controlledResources`

, the Recommender doesn't respond to OOM events. In this example, we only set CPU in`controlledValues`

.`controlledValues`

allows you to choose whether to update the container's resource requests using the`RequestsOnly`

option, or by both resource requests and limits using the`RequestsAndLimits`

option. The default value is`RequestsAndLimits`

. If you use the`RequestsAndLimits`

option, requests are computed based on actual usage, and limits are calculated based on the current pod's request and limit ratio.For example, if you start with a pod that requests 2 CPUs and limits to 4 CPUs, VPA always sets the limit to be twice as much as requests. The same principle applies to Memory. When you use the

`RequestsAndLimits`

mode, it can serve as a blueprint for your initial application resource requests and limits.You can simplify the VPA object using

`Auto`

mode and computing recommendations for both CPU and Memory.Deploy the

`hamster-extra-recomender.yaml`

example using thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f hamster-extra-recommender.yaml`

Monitor your pods using the

`[kubectl get`

][kubectl-get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get --watch pods -l app=hamster`

When the new hamster pod starts, view the updated CPU and Memory reservations using the

command. Make sure you replace`kubectl describe`

`<example-pod>`

with one of your pod IDs.`kubectl describe pod hamster-<example-pod>`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`State: Running Started: Wed, 28 Sep 2022 15:09:51 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Requests: cpu: 587m memory: 262144k Environment: <none>`

View updated recommendations from VPA using the

command.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe vpa/hamster-vpa`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`State: Running Started: Wed, 28 Sep 2022 15:09:51 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Requests: cpu: 587m memory: 262144k Environment: <none> Spec: recommenders: Name: customized-recommender`


## Troubleshoot the Vertical Pod Autoscaler

If you encounter issues with the Vertical Pod Autoscaler, you can troubleshoot the system components and custom resource definition to identify the problem.

Verify that all system components are running using the following command:

`kubectl get pods|grep vpa`

Your output should list

*three pods*: recommender, updater, and admission-controller, all with a status of`Running`

.For each of the pods returned in your previous output, verify that the system components are logging any errors using the following command:

`kubectl logs [pod name] | grep -e '^E[0-9]\{4\}'`

Verify that the custom resource definition was created using the following command:

`kubectl get customresourcedefinition | grep verticalpodautoscalers`


## Next steps

# Best practices for pod security in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the security of your pods is a key consideration. Your applications should be designed for the principle of least number of privileges required. Keeping private data secure is top of mind for customers. You don't want credentials like database connection strings, keys, or secrets and certificates exposed to the outside world where an attacker could take advantage of those secrets for malicious purposes. Don't add them to your code or embed them in your container images. This approach would create a risk for exposure and limit the ability to rotate those credentials as the container images will need to be rebuilt.

This best practices article focuses on how to secure pods in AKS. You learn how to:

- Use pod security context to limit access to processes and services or privilege escalation
- Authenticate with other Azure resources using Microsoft Entra Workload ID
- Request and retrieve credentials from a digital vault such as Azure Key Vault

You can also read the best practices for [cluster security](operator-best-practices-cluster-security) and for [container image management](operator-best-practices-container-image-management).

## Secure pod access to resources

**Best practice guidance** - To run as a different user or group and limit access to the underlying node processes and services, define pod security context settings. Assign the least number of privileges required.

For your applications to run correctly, pods should run as a defined user or group and not as *root*. The `securityContext`

for a pod or container lets you define settings such as *runAsUser* or *fsGroup* to assume the appropriate permissions. Only assign the required user or group permissions, and don't use the security context as a means to assume additional permissions. The *runAsUser*, privilege escalation, and other Linux capabilities settings are only available on Linux nodes and pods.

When you run as a non-root user, containers cannot bind to the privileged ports under 1024. In this scenario, Kubernetes Services can be used to disguise the fact that an app is running on a particular port.

A pod security context can also define additional capabilities or permissions for accessing processes and services. The following common security context definitions can be set:

**allowPrivilegeEscalation**defines if the pod can assume*root*privileges. Design your applications so this setting is always set to*false*.**Linux capabilities**let the pod access underlying node processes. Take care with assigning these capabilities. Assign the least number of privileges needed. For more information, see[Linux capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).**SELinux labels**is a Linux kernel security module that lets you define access policies for services, processes, and filesystem access. Again, assign the least number of privileges needed. For more information, see[SELinux options in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.27/#selinuxoptions-v1-core)**hostUsers: false**the pod runs using a user-namespace, a Linux kernel feature. This significatly improves the host isolation and limits the lateral movement in case of container breakouts. These improvements are significant whether the container is running as root or not. For more information, see[user-namespaces](secure-container-access#user-namespaces).

The following example pod YAML manifest sets security context settings to define:

- Pod runs as user ID
*1000*and part of group ID*2000* - Can't escalate privileges to use
`root`

- Allows Linux capabilities to access network interfaces and the host's real-time (hardware) clock

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: security-context-demo
spec:
securityContext:
fsGroup: 2000
containers:
- name: security-context-demo
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
securityContext:
runAsUser: 1000
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
capabilities:
add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]
```


Work with your cluster operator to determine which security context settings you need. Design your applications to minimize other permissions and access the pod requires. There are other security features to limit access using AppArmor, seccomp (secure computing), and user-namespaces that can be implemented by cluster operators.

For more information, see [Secure container access to resources](operator-best-practices-cluster-security#secure-container-access-to-resources).

## Limit credential exposure

**Best practice guidance** - Don't define credentials in your application code. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be used to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. Pod-managed identities are intended for use with Linux pods and container images only.

To limit the risk of credentials being exposed in your application code, avoid the use of fixed or shared credentials. Credentials or keys shouldn't be included directly in your code. If these credentials are exposed, the application needs to be updated and redeployed. A better approach is to give pods their own identity and way to authenticate themselves, or automatically retrieve credentials from a digital vault.

#### Use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID

A workload identity is an identity used by an application running on a pod that can authenticate itself against other Azure services that support it, such as Storage or SQL. It integrates with the capabilities native to Kubernetes to federate with external identity providers. In this security model, the AKS cluster acts as token issuer, Microsoft Entra ID uses OpenID Connect to discover public signing keys and verify the authenticity of the service account token before exchanging it for a Microsoft Entra token. Your workload can exchange a service account token projected to its volume for a Microsoft Entra token using the Azure Identity client library using the [Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/) or the [Microsoft Authentication Library](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) (MSAL).

For more information about workload identities, see [Configure an AKS cluster to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with your applications](workload-identity-overview)

#### Use Azure Key Vault with Secrets Store CSI Driver

Using the [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview) enables authentication against supporting Azure services. For your own services or applications without managed identities for Azure resources, you can still authenticate using credentials or keys. A digital vault can be used to store these secret contents.

When applications need a credential, they communicate with the digital vault, retrieve the latest secret contents, and then connect to the required service. Azure Key Vault can be this digital vault. The simplified workflow for retrieving a credential from Azure Key Vault using pod managed identities is shown in the following diagram:


With Key Vault, you store and regularly rotate secrets such as credentials, storage account keys, or certificates. You can integrate Azure Key Vault with an AKS cluster using the [Azure Key Vault provider for the Secrets Store CSI Driver](csi-secrets-store-driver). The Secrets Store CSI driver enables the AKS cluster to natively retrieve secret contents from Key Vault and securely provide them only to the requesting pod. Work with your cluster operator to deploy the Secrets Store CSI Driver onto AKS worker nodes. You can use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID to request access to Key Vault and retrieve the secret contents needed through the Secrets Store CSI Driver.

## Next steps

# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) CNI networking overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes uses Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugins to manage networking in Kubernetes clusters. CNI plug-ins are responsible for assigning IP addresses to pods, network routing between pods, Kubernetes service routing, and more.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides multiple CNI plugins that you can use in your clusters, depending on your networking requirements.

## Networking models in AKS

Choosing a CNI plugin for your AKS cluster largely depends on which networking model fits your needs best. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages that you should consider when planning your AKS cluster.

AKS uses two main networking models:

**Overlay network**:- Conserves IP address space for virtual networks by using logically separate Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges for pods.
- Provides maximum cluster scale support.
- Provides simple management of IP addresses.

**Flat network**:- Provides full virtual network connectivity for pods. Pods can be directly reached via their private IP address from connected networks.
- Requires large, non-fragmented IP address space for virtual networks.


Both networking models have multiple supported options for CNI plugins. The main differences between the models are how pod IP addresses are assigned and how traffic leaves the cluster.

### Overlay networks

Overlay networking is the most common networking model used in Kubernetes. In overlay networks, pods receive an IP address from a private, logically separate CIDR from the Azure virtual network subnet where AKS nodes are deployed. This configuration allows for simpler and often better scalability than the flat network model.

In overlay networks, pods can communicate with each other directly. Traffic that leaves the cluster is Source Network Address Translated (SNAT'd) to the node's IP address. Inbound pod IP traffic is routed through a service, such as a load balancer. The pod IP address is then "hidden" behind the node's IP address. This approach reduces the number of IP addresses required for virtual networks in your clusters.


For overlay networking, AKS provides the [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) plugin. We recommend this CNI plugin for most scenarios.

### Flat networks

Unlike an overlay network, a flat network model in AKS assigns IP addresses to pods from a subnet from the same Azure virtual network as the AKS nodes. Traffic that leaves your clusters is not SNAT'd, and the pod IP address is directly exposed to the destination. This approach can be useful for some scenarios, such as when you need to expose pod IP addresses to external services.


AKS provides two CNI plugins for flat networking:

[Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), the recommended CNI plugin for flat networking scenarios.[Azure CNI Node Subnet](concepts-network-legacy-cni#azure-cni-node-subnet), a legacy CNI model for flat networks. In general, we recommend that you use it only if you*need*a managed virtual network for your cluster.

## Choosing a CNI plugin

When you're choosing a CNI plugin, there are several factors to consider. Each networking model has its own advantages and disadvantages. The best choice for your cluster depends on your specific requirements.

### Use case comparison

| CNI plugin | Networking model | Use case highlights |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | Overlay | - Best for conserving IPs for virtual networks - Maximum node count supported by API server plus 250 pods per node - Simpler configuration - No direct external pod IP access |
| Azure CNI Pod Subnet | Flat | - Direct external pod access - Modes for efficient IP usage for virtual networks or large cluster scale support (preview) |
| Kubenet (legacy) | Overlay | - Prioritization of IP conservation - Limited scale - Manual route management |
| Azure CNI Node Subnet (legacy) | Flat | - Direct external pod access - Simpler configuration - Limited scale - Inefficient use of IPs for virtual networks |

### Feature comparison

| Feature | Azure CNI Overlay | Azure CNI Pod Subnet | Azure CNI Node Subnet (legacy) | Kubenet (legacy) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deployment of a cluster in an existing or new virtual network | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported with manual user-defined routes (UDRs) |
| Connectivity between pod and virtual machine (VM), with the VM in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network | Pod initiated | Both ways | Both ways | Pod initiated |
| On-premises access via virtual private network (VPN) and Azure ExpressRoute | Pod initiated | Both ways | Both ways | Pod initiated |
| Access to service endpoints | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via load balancer | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via Azure Application Gateway ingress controller | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via Application Gateway for Containers | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
| Windows node pools | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Default Azure DNS and private zones | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Sharing of virtual network subnets across multiple clusters | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not supported |

### Support scope between network models

Depending on the CNI plugin that you use, you can deploy the virtual network resources for your cluster in one of the following ways:

- The Azure platform can automatically create and configure the virtual network resources when you create an AKS cluster, like in Azure CNI Overlay, Azure CNI Node Subnet, and Kubenet.
- You can manually create and configure the virtual network resources and attach to those resources when you create your AKS cluster.

Although capabilities like service endpoints or UDRs are supported, the [support policies for AKS](support-policies) define what changes you can make. For example:

- If you manually create the virtual network resources for an AKS cluster, you're supported when configuring your own UDRs or service endpoints.
- If the Azure platform automatically creates the virtual network resources for your AKS cluster, you can't manually change those AKS-managed resources to configure your own UDRs or service endpoints.

## Prerequisites

When you're planning your network configuration for AKS, keep these requirements and considerations in mind:

- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for address ranges for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual networks. - In scenarios where you bring your own virtual network, the cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

(needed only if you're defining your own subnets and CIDRs)

- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Azure network security groups overview](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

# Configure Azure NetApp Files for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

A persistent volume represents a piece of storage that has been provisioned for use with Kubernetes pods. A persistent volume can be used by one or many pods, and it can be statically or dynamically provisioned. This article shows you how to configure [Azure NetApp Files](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction) to be used by pods on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

[Azure NetApp Files](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction) is an enterprise-class, high-performance, metered file storage service running on Azure and supports volumes using [NFS](azure-netapp-files-nfs) (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), [SMB](azure-netapp-files-smb), and [dual-protocol](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol) (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB). Kubernetes users have two options for using Azure NetApp Files volumes for Kubernetes workloads:

- Create Azure NetApp Files volumes
**statically**. In this scenario, the creation of volumes is external to AKS. Volumes are created using the Azure CLI or from the Azure portal, and are then exposed to Kubernetes by the creation of a`PersistentVolume`

. Statically created Azure NetApp Files volumes have many limitations (for example, inability to be expanded, needing to be over-provisioned, and so on). Statically created volumes aren't recommended for most use cases. - Create Azure NetApp Files volumes
**dynamically**, orchestrating through Kubernetes. This method is the**preferred**way to create multiple volumes directly through Kubernetes, and is achieved using[Trident](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html). Trident is a CSI-compliant dynamic storage orchestrator that helps provision volumes natively through Kubernetes.

Note

Dual-protocol volumes can only be created **statically**. For more information on using dual-protocol volumes with Azure Kubernetes Service, see [Provision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol).

Using a CSI driver to directly consume Azure NetApp Files volumes from AKS workloads is the recommended configuration for most use cases. This requirement is accomplished using Trident, an open-source dynamic storage orchestrator for Kubernetes. Trident is an enterprise-grade storage orchestrator purpose-built for Kubernetes, and fully supported by NetApp. It simplifies access to storage from Kubernetes clusters by automating storage provisioning.

You can take advantage of Trident's Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Azure NetApp Files to abstract underlying details and create, expand, and snapshot volumes on-demand.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Before you begin

The following considerations apply when you use Azure NetApp Files:

- Your AKS cluster must be
[in a region that supports Azure NetApp Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=netapp®ions=all). - The Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - After the initial deployment of an AKS cluster, you can choose to provision Azure NetApp Files volumes statically or dynamically.
- To use dynamic provisioning with Azure NetApp Files with Network File System (NFS), install and configure
[Trident](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/index.html)version 19.07 or higher. To use dynamic provisioning with Azure NetApp Files with Secure Message Block (SMB), install and configure Trident version 22.10 or higher. Dynamic provisioning for SMB shares is only supported on windows worker nodes. - Before you deploy Azure NetApp Files SMB volumes, you must identify the AD DS integration requirements for Azure NetApp Files to ensure that Azure NetApp Files is well connected to AD DS. For more information, see
[Understand guidelines for Active Directory Domain Services site design and planning](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/understand-guidelines-active-directory-domain-service-site). Both the AKS cluster and Azure NetApp Files must have connectivity to the same AD.

## Configure Azure NetApp Files for AKS workloads

This section describes how to set up Azure NetApp Files for AKS workloads. It's applicable for all scenarios within this article.

Define variables for later usage. Replace

*myresourcegroup*,*mylocation*,*myaccountname*,*mypool1*,*poolsize*,*premium*,*myvnet*,*myANFSubnet*, and*myprefix*with appropriate values for your environment.`RESOURCE_GROUP="myresourcegroup" LOCATION="mylocation" ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME="myaccountname" POOL_NAME="mypool1" SIZE="poolsize" # size in TiB SERVICE_LEVEL="Premium" # valid values are Standard, Premium and Ultra VNET_NAME="myvnet" SUBNET_NAME="myANFSubnet" ADDRESS_PREFIX="myprefix"`

Register the

*Microsoft.NetApp*resource provider by running the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.NetApp --wait`

Note

This operation can take several minutes to complete.

Create a new account by using the command

. When you create an Azure NetApp account for use with AKS, you can create the account in an existing resource group or create a new one in the same region as the AKS cluster.`az netappfiles account create`

`az netappfiles account create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --location $LOCATION \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME`

Create a new capacity pool by using the command

. Replace the variables shown in the command with your Azure NetApp Files information. The`az netappfiles pool create`

`account_name`

should be the same as created in Step 3.`az netappfiles pool create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --location $LOCATION \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --pool-name $POOL_NAME \ --size $SIZE \ --service-level $SERVICE_LEVEL`

Create a subnet to

[delegate to Azure NetApp Files](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet)using the command. Specify the resource group hosting the existing virtual network for your AKS cluster. Replace the variables shown in the command with your Azure NetApp Files information.`az network vnet subnet create`

Note

This subnet must be in the same virtual network as your AKS cluster.

`az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --delegations "Microsoft.Netapp/volumes" \ --address-prefixes $ADDRESS_PREFIX`


## Statically or dynamically provision Azure NetApp Files volumes for NFS or SMB

After you [configure Azure NetApp Files for AKS workloads](#configure-azure-netapp-files-for-aks-workloads), you can statically or dynamically provision Azure NetApp Files using NFS, SMB, or dual-protocol volumes within the capacity pool. Follow instructions in:

[Provision Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-nfs)[Provision Azure NetApp Files SMB volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-smb)[Provision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol)

## Next steps

Trident supports many features with Azure NetApp Files. For more information, see:

Kubernetes uses Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugins to manage networking in Kubernetes clusters. CNI plug-ins are responsible for assigning IP addresses to pods, network routing between pods, Kubernetes service routing, and more.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides multiple CNI plugins that you can use in your clusters, depending on your networking requirements.

## Networking models in AKS

Choosing a CNI plugin for your AKS cluster largely depends on which networking model fits your needs best. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages that you should consider when planning your AKS cluster.

AKS uses two main networking models:

**Overlay network**:- Conserves IP address space for virtual networks by using logically separate Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ranges for pods.
- Provides maximum cluster scale support.
- Provides simple management of IP addresses.

**Flat network**:- Provides full virtual network connectivity for pods. Pods can be directly reached via their private IP address from connected networks.
- Requires large, non-fragmented IP address space for virtual networks.


Both networking models have multiple supported options for CNI plugins. The main differences between the models are how pod IP addresses are assigned and how traffic leaves the cluster.

### Overlay networks

Overlay networking is the most common networking model used in Kubernetes. In overlay networks, pods receive an IP address from a private, logically separate CIDR from the Azure virtual network subnet where AKS nodes are deployed. This configuration allows for simpler and often better scalability than the flat network model.

In overlay networks, pods can communicate with each other directly. Traffic that leaves the cluster is Source Network Address Translated (SNAT'd) to the node's IP address. Inbound pod IP traffic is routed through a service, such as a load balancer. The pod IP address is then "hidden" behind the node's IP address. This approach reduces the number of IP addresses required for virtual networks in your clusters.


For overlay networking, AKS provides the [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) plugin. We recommend this CNI plugin for most scenarios.

### Flat networks

Unlike an overlay network, a flat network model in AKS assigns IP addresses to pods from a subnet from the same Azure virtual network as the AKS nodes. Traffic that leaves your clusters is not SNAT'd, and the pod IP address is directly exposed to the destination. This approach can be useful for some scenarios, such as when you need to expose pod IP addresses to external services.


AKS provides two CNI plugins for flat networking:

[Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), the recommended CNI plugin for flat networking scenarios.[Azure CNI Node Subnet](concepts-network-legacy-cni#azure-cni-node-subnet), a legacy CNI model for flat networks. In general, we recommend that you use it only if you*need*a managed virtual network for your cluster.

## Choosing a CNI plugin

When you're choosing a CNI plugin, there are several factors to consider. Each networking model has its own advantages and disadvantages. The best choice for your cluster depends on your specific requirements.

### Use case comparison

| CNI plugin | Networking model | Use case highlights |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | Overlay | - Best for conserving IPs for virtual networks - Maximum node count supported by API server plus 250 pods per node - Simpler configuration - No direct external pod IP access |
| Azure CNI Pod Subnet | Flat | - Direct external pod access - Modes for efficient IP usage for virtual networks or large cluster scale support (preview) |
| Kubenet (legacy) | Overlay | - Prioritization of IP conservation - Limited scale - Manual route management |
| Azure CNI Node Subnet (legacy) | Flat | - Direct external pod access - Simpler configuration - Limited scale - Inefficient use of IPs for virtual networks |

### Feature comparison

| Feature | Azure CNI Overlay | Azure CNI Pod Subnet | Azure CNI Node Subnet (legacy) | Kubenet (legacy) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deployment of a cluster in an existing or new virtual network | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported with manual user-defined routes (UDRs) |
| Connectivity between pod and virtual machine (VM), with the VM in the same virtual network or a peered virtual network | Pod initiated | Both ways | Both ways | Pod initiated |
| On-premises access via virtual private network (VPN) and Azure ExpressRoute | Pod initiated | Both ways | Both ways | Pod initiated |
| Access to service endpoints | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via load balancer | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via Azure Application Gateway ingress controller | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Exposure of services via Application Gateway for Containers | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
| Windows node pools | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not supported |
| Default Azure DNS and private zones | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| Sharing of virtual network subnets across multiple clusters | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not supported |

### Support scope between network models

Depending on the CNI plugin that you use, you can deploy the virtual network resources for your cluster in one of the following ways:

- The Azure platform can automatically create and configure the virtual network resources when you create an AKS cluster, like in Azure CNI Overlay, Azure CNI Node Subnet, and Kubenet.
- You can manually create and configure the virtual network resources and attach to those resources when you create your AKS cluster.

Although capabilities like service endpoints or UDRs are supported, the [support policies for AKS](support-policies) define what changes you can make. For example:

- If you manually create the virtual network resources for an AKS cluster, you're supported when configuring your own UDRs or service endpoints.
- If the Azure platform automatically creates the virtual network resources for your AKS cluster, you can't manually change those AKS-managed resources to configure your own UDRs or service endpoints.

## Prerequisites

When you're planning your network configuration for AKS, keep these requirements and considerations in mind:

- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for address ranges for the Kubernetes service, pods, or cluster virtual networks. - In scenarios where you bring your own virtual network, the cluster identity that the AKS cluster uses must have at least
[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

(needed only if you're defining your own subnets and CIDRs)

- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a
[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). - AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Azure network security groups overview](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).
