Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article addresses upgrade experiences for Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To learn more about the release schedule and support for service mesh add-on revisions, read the [support policy](istio-support-policy#versioning-and-support-policy).

## Minor revision upgrade

Istio add-on allows upgrading the minor revision using [canary upgrade process](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/). When an upgrade is initiated, the control plane of the new (canary) revision is deployed alongside the initial (stable) revision's control plane. You can then manually roll over data plane workloads while using monitoring tools to track the health of workloads during this process. If you don't observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can complete the upgrade so that only the new revision remains on the cluster. Else, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio.

Available upgrades depend on whether the current Istio revision and AKS cluster version are supported:

- You can upgrade to the
**next supported revision (**or skip one and upgrade to`n+1`

), as long as both are supported and compatible with the cluster version.`n+2`

- If both your current revision (
`n`

) and the next revision (`n+1`

) are unsupported, you can only upgrade to the**nearest supported revision (**, but not beyond it.`n+2`

or higher) - If the cluster version and Istio revision are both unsupported, the cluster version must be upgraded before an Istio upgrade can be initiated.

Note

Once an AKS version or mesh revision falls outside the support window, upgrading either version becomes error-prone. While such upgrades are **allowed** to recover to a supported version, **the upgrade process and the out-of-support versions themselves are both not supported by Microsoft**. We strongly recommend keeping AKS version and mesh revision up to date to avoid running into unsupported scenarios. Refer to the [Istio add-on support calendar](istio-support-policy#service-mesh-add-on-release-calendar) for estimated release and end-of-life dates and the [upstream Istio release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/) for the new revision for notable changes.

The following example illustrates how to upgrade from revision `asm-1-23`

to `asm-1-24`

with all workloads in the `default`

namespace. The steps are the same for all minor upgrades and may be used for any number of namespaces.

Use the

[az aks mesh get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-upgrades)command to check which revisions are available for the cluster as upgrade targets:`az aks mesh get-upgrades --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

If you expect to see a newer revision not returned by this command, you may need to upgrade your AKS cluster first so that it's compatible with the newest revision.

If you set up

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)for the existing mesh revision on your cluster, you need to create a separate ConfigMap corresponding to the new revision in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace**before initiating the canary upgrade**in the next step. This configuration is applicable the moment the new revision's control plane is deployed on cluster. More details can be found[here](istio-meshconfig#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades).Initiate a canary upgrade from revision

`asm-1-23`

to`asm-1-24`

using[az aks mesh upgrade start](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh/upgrade#az-aks-mesh-upgrade-start):`az aks mesh upgrade start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --revision asm-1-24`

A canary upgrade means the 1.24 control plane is deployed alongside the 1.23 control plane. They continue to coexist until you either complete or roll back the upgrade.

While a canary upgrade is in progress, the higher revision is considered the

*default revision*used for validation of Istio resources.Optionally, revision tags may be used to roll over the data plane to the new revision without needing to manually relabel each namespace. Manually relabeling namespaces when moving them to a new revision can be tedious and error-prone.

[Revision tags](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/#stable-revision-labels)solve this problem by serving as stable identifiers that point to revisions.Rather than relabeling each namespace, a cluster operator can change the tag to point to a new revision. All namespaces labeled with that tag are updated at the same time. However, you still need to restart the workloads to make sure the correct version of

`istio-proxy`

sidecars are injected.To use revision tags during an upgrade:

Create a revision tag for the initial revision. In this example, we name it

`prod-stable`

:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Create a revision tag for the revision installed during the upgrade. In this example, we name it

`prod-canary`

:`istioctl tag set prod-canary --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Label application namespaces to map to revision tags:

`# label default namespace to map to asm-1-23 kubectl label ns default istio.io/rev=prod-stable --overwrite`

You may also label namespaces with

`istio.io/rev=prod-canary`

for the newer revision. However, the workloads in those namespaces aren't updated to a new sidecar until they're restarted.If a new application is created in a namespace after it is labeled, a sidecar will be injected corresponding to the revision tag on that namespace.


Verify control plane pods corresponding to both

`asm-1-23`

and`asm-1-24`

exist:Verify

`istiod`

pods:`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-system`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-dbzlt 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-fg8zh 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-7rwg4 1/1 Running 0 51m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-8p9qx 1/1 Running 0 51m`

If ingress is enabled, verify ingress pods:

`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-qkvq2 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-vhtd5 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-ft9c8 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-wcb6s 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-4cc2l 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-jjc7m 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-g89s4 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-krq9w 1/1 Running 0 51m`

Observe that ingress gateway pods of both revisions are deployed side-by-side. However, the service and its IP remain immutable.


Relabel the namespace so that any new pods are mapped to the Istio sidecar associated with the new revision and its control plane:

If using revision tags, overwrite the

`prod-stable`

tag itself to change its mapping:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Verify the tag-to-revision mappings:

`istioctl tag list`

Both tags should point to the newly installed revision:

`TAG REVISION NAMESPACES prod-canary asm-1-24 default prod-stable asm-1-24 ...`

In this case, you don't need to relabel each namespace individually.

If not using revision tags, data plane namespaces must be relabeled to point to the new revision:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-24 --overwrite`


Relabeling doesn't affect your workloads until they're restarted.

Individually roll over each of your application workloads by restarting them. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Check your monitoring tools and dashboards to determine whether your workloads are all running in a healthy state after the restart. Based on the outcome, you have two options:

**Complete the canary upgrade**: If you're satisfied that the workloads are all running in a healthy state as expected, you can complete the canary upgrade. Completion of the upgrade removes the previous revision's control plane and leaves behind the new revision's control plane on the cluster. Run the following command to complete the canary upgrade:`az aks mesh upgrade complete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

**Rollback the canary upgrade**: In case you observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio:

Relabel the namespace to the previous revision: If using revision tags:

`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Or, if not using revision tags:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-23 --overwrite`

Roll back the workloads to use the sidecar corresponding to the previous Istio revision by restarting these workloads again:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Roll back the control plane to the previous revision:

`az aks mesh upgrade rollback --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`


The

`prod-canary`

revision tag can be removed:`istioctl tag remove prod-canary --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

If

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)was previously set up for the revisions, you can now delete the ConfigMap for the revision that was removed from the cluster during complete/rollback.

### Minor revision upgrades with ingress and egress gateways

If you're currently using [Istio ingress gateways](istio-deploy-ingress) or [egress gateways](istio-deploy-egress) and are performing a minor revision upgrade, keep in mind that Istio ingress and egress gateway pods / deployments are deployed per-revision, but the service is shared across both revisions.

We provide a single `LoadBalancer`

service across all ingress gateway pods over multiple revisions, so the external/internal IP address of the ingress gateways remains unchanged throughout the course of an upgrade. Thus, during the canary upgrade, when two revisions exist simultaneously on the cluster, the ingress gateway pods of both revisions serve incoming traffic.

Likewise, during a canary upgrade, all pods for an egress gateway across both revisions will be served by a single `ClusterIP`

service.

### Minor revision upgrades with horizontal pod autoscaling customizations

If you have customized [horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) settings for Istiod or the ingress gateways](istio-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaling-customization), note the following behavior for how HPA settings are applied across both revisions to maintain consistency during a canary upgrade:

- If you update the HPA spec before initiating an upgrade, the settings from the existing (stable) revision will be applied to the HPAs of the canary revision when the new control plane is installed.
- If you update the HPA spec while a canary upgrade is in progress, the HPA spec of the stable revision will take precedence and be applied to the HPA of the canary revision.
- If you update the HPA of the stable revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be updated to reflect the new settings applied to the stable revision.
- If you update the HPA of the canary revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be reverted to the HPA spec of the stable revision.


## Patch version upgrade

- Istio add-on patch version availability information is published in
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - Patches are rolled out automatically for istiod and ingress pods as part of these AKS releases, which respect the
`default`

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)set up for the cluster. - User needs to initiate patches to Istio proxy in their workloads by restarting the pods for reinjection:
Check the version of the Istio proxy intended for new or restarted pods. This version is the same as the version of the istiod and Istio ingress pods after they were patched:

`kubectl get cm -n aks-istio-system -o yaml | grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless", "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless"`

Check the Istio proxy image version for all pods in a namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.23.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless`

To trigger reinjection, restart the workloads. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployments/productpage-v1 -n default`

To verify that they're now on the newer versions, check the Istio proxy image version again for all pods in the namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.2.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.24.0-distroless`

# Pod Sandboxing considerations

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

For Pod Sandboxing deployments on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) there are several items to consider in regard to resource management, memory management, CPU management, and security.

## Resource management

Memory and CPU management behavior with Pod Sandboxing might be unfamiliar to some users. These considerations are relevant when specifying resources in a deployment, especially for larger and resource sensitive workloads.

### Kata components

In a Kata deployment, there are generally two families of components that get deployed. You have **host components** and **guest components**.

- The main
**host components**comprise of the*Kata shim*,*Cloud Hypervisor*, and*virtiofsd*.- The
*Kata shim*manages a pod VM lifecycle. *Cloud Hypervisor*is the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) used by the Kata shim.*virtiofsd*is a daemon used to share files between each Pod VM and its container host.

- The
- The main
**guest components**include the*user's workloads*,*pod VM kernel*, and the*Kata agent*.- The
*Kata agent*manages containers inside of the Pod VMs

- The

### Memory management

With Kata pods, you have the ability to specify the amount of memory of the Pod VM that hosts your workloads. It's crucial that you configure the values accordingly so that a pod has sufficient resources, but doesn't result in unused memory being allocated to the pod.

### Pod VM memory size

There's an amount of memory allocated to each pod VM that runs a container. This VM memory size is inclusive of all the memory necessary to run Kata guest components. Users should take care to ensure that they buffer some extra memory beyond the expected consumption of their workloads to account for the consumption of other guest components, such as the kata agent or VM kernel. Examples are given on typical memory values later on in this article.

The pod VM memory size is equivalent to the [Kubernetes pod memory limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-and-a-memory-limit) the user specifies. A user can change the value by changing their pod memory limit; if no values are specified, a default size of 512Mi is applied. Once the pod starts, this size becomes fixed.

As the pod VM memory size increases, the runtime class memory overhead should be expected to increase alongside it.

### Runtime class memory overhead

Pod Sandboxing workloads come with a default kata runtime class (`kata-vm-isolation`

) which comes with default overheads for resources. Users that want finer grain control of their resource quotas can [set up a custom runtime class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/#setup) with specific resource overheads. When doing so, users should ensure that the memory overhead value of the runtime class is enough that covers all expected usage for the **host components** of a kata deployment. The runtime class memory overhead does *not* need to account for the expected memory consumption of the **guest components**.

You can create a specialized runtime and specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RuntimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example), let's assume I want to create a runtime for workloads I expect to be smaller in consumption:

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: small-kata-pods
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
memory: "120Mi"
```


Specifying overheads isn't required, and suggested if you want finer control over the resources being set aside for your workloads. If you use the default `kata-vm-isolation`

runtime class and don't specify any overheads in your YAML, the overhead of the Pod VM size defaults to 512Mi and the runtime class overhead defaults to 600Mi. This default runtime overhead is calculated with the default pod VM size (512Mi) plus to approximate memory needed by host components for such a VM size (~88Mi).

### User workloads

When a user deploys a Kata workload, they're able to use memory up to the configured *pod VM memory size* minus the other guest components, such as the Kata agent or the guest VM kernel.

If you would like to get an approximation of the memory used by these components:

- Connect to the pod VM (either via
`kubectl exec`

or`kubectl debug`

to open a shell inside your pod). - Run the
`free`

command. - Inspect the "used" column in the output to get an idea of the memory consumed by the guest kernel/kata agent.

### Memory cgroups

When a Kata pod is scheduled to run, kubelet assigns the pod to a memory `cgroup`

. This `cgroup`

enforces the pod's memory limits/requests, allowing a user to define the resource quotas available to a pod.

Within the memory `cgroup`

, there are two important fields to consider:

`memory.current`

defines how many bytes of memory the host components and the pod VM memory size allocates.`memory.max`

optional, user defined upper limit of memory.current for pods where users want to impose a memory limit.- The kubelet computes this value as the sum of a pod's memory limit and its runtime class memory overhead.


At any point, if the `memory.current`

value exceeds that of `memory.max`

, [the kernel might trigger an OOMKill on the pod if memory pressure is detected](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

### Reference usage values

Users can utilize these values to serve as a reference for the typical memory usage and values across the different variables covered. Pod VM memory sizes under 128Mi aren't supported.

| Pod VM Memory Size | Runtime class overhead | memory.current | memory.max | Free memory available to Host components |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128Mi | 16Mi | 133Mi | 144Mi | 11Mi |
| 256Mi | 32Mi | 263Mi | 288Mi | 25Mi |
| 1Gi | 128Mi | 1034Mi | 1152Mi | 118Mi |
| 2Gi | 256Mi | 2063Mi | 2304Mi | 241Mi |
| 4Gi | 374Mi | 4122Mi | 4470Mi | 348Mi |
| 8Gi | 512Mi | 8232Mi | 8704Mi | 472Mi |
| 32Gi | 640Mi | 32918Mi | 33408Mi | 490Mi |
| 64Gi | 768Mi | 65825Mi | 66304Mi | 479Mi |
| 96Gi | 896Mi | 98738Mi | 99200Mi | 462Mi |
| 128Gi | 1Gi | 131646Mi | 132096Mi | 450Mi |

## CPU management

In a similar vein to memory, you can also allocate CPU resources to your Kata workloads. Doing so is recommended; without declaring a CPU limit for your Kata pod, Kata host components are able to use any CPU capacity available on the node.

### Reserving CPU

When reserving CPUs for your Kata workloads, you have two fields you can choose to set.

- The
*runtime class CPU overhead* - The
*pod CPU limit*

When at least one of the two values is specified, the control plane reserves the specified number of CPUs on the node for your workload. Other pods on the same node can't access this reserved capacity.

### Pod CPU limit

You can declare your [pod CPU limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/) in your application's manifest. A specified pod CPU limit defines the limit of the CPUs that containers in the associated pod VM can use.

If you specify fractions of CPUs for the pod CPU limit, those fractions will get rounded up to the next integer. The rounded up number becomes the number of vCPUs allocated to the Pod VM, but a `cgroup`

will limit the workload to only consume the fraction specified in the pod CPU limit.

If no number is declared, one vCPU will be allocated to the pod VM if the capacity is available on the node. There's no limit on the CPU consumption of the Kata host components.

### Runtime class CPU overhead

The runtime class overhead should be specified if you'd like to preemptively reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components.

You can specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RunTimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example):

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: custom-kata-runtime
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
cpu: "250m"
```


### Best practices

#### Memory management

- Ensure you specify pod VM memory sizes (defined by the
`limits.memory`

in your manifest) and suitable resource quotas for all your deployments.- Ensure you use a nonzero
*pod request*if you want to ensure that some node capacity is reserved for the pod VM before that VM starts up. The request should account for the pod VM and containers that are expected to run on it. - Ensure you use a nonzero
*runtime class overhead*if you want to reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components before those components start up.

- Ensure you use a nonzero
- If you expect your pod workloads to be especially resource hungry, you can specify limits accordingly for the pod VM to ensure that there are ample resources available for your workloads.
- Declare a suitable runtime class memory overhead such that it gives enough memory for your host components but doesn't take too much to avoid allocating unused memory.

#### CPU management

If your node typically has plenty of free CPU capacity, these reservations might be unnecessary.

If your nodes typically run to the limit with CPU consumption, then a nonzero reservation ensures your pods can be executed more reliably.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
*not*available to other workloads on the node.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
Make sure you specify CPU requests that your infrastructure can accommodate. If your available capacity runs near 0, or your request is too large, your workloads might

[fail to start](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-that-is-too-big-for-your-nodes)Align your CPU requests with your CPU limits. The Kata shim doesn't have visibility into requests. Therefore, if no CPU limit is declared, the pod VM is limited to one vCPU. The Kata host components, which do have visibility into request values, consumes the rest of the requested CPU count and have no limit to CPU consumption.

Reserved capacity for a specific workload is

*not*available to other workloads on the node.

### Example declarations

| Runtime class CPU overhead | Pod CPU Request/Limit | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | The control plane reserves two CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets one CPU, and containers on the pod can use up to the one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to two CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| 1 | 2.5 | The control plane reserves 3.5 CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets three vCPUs, but containers on the pod VM can use up to 2.5 vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to 3.5 CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| None | 1 | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and the pod VM together are allowed to use up to one CPU from the reserved capacity on the node. One CPU is always available to the pod VM due to the CPU request. |
| 1 | None | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The kata host components and the pod VM can use any CPU capacity available on the node. At least one CPU is always available due to the overhead reservation. |

## Security

Pod Sandboxing offers users a compelling option to isolate their workloads from other workloads and the host. There are, nonetheless, important security concerns that should be taken into account.

### Privileged pods

There are scenarios in which privileged pods might be required. Users are able to spin up privileged pods, but no [host devices are attached to the pod](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/privileged.md#containerd).

Using privileged containers lead to root access in the guest VM, but remain isolated from the host.

Privileged pods, even on Pod Sandboxing, should only be used when necessary. Privileged pods should continue to be [managed by trusted users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#privileged).

### Host path storage volumes

`hostPath`

volumes can be mounted into Kata pods. In Pod Sandboxing, using `hostPath`

volumes can potentially undermine the isolation that Kata provides; since part of the host filesystem is exposed directly to the container, a potential attack vector is opened. The warnings posed by [upstream](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) should be considered as relevant for Pod Sandboxing as well.

There are some exceptions; files under `/dev`

are mounted into the container from the guest system instead of the host system. This helps maintain pod isolation for situations where this path must be mounted to function.

Warning

Unless necessary, the recommendation is to *avoid* using hostPath storage volumes.

#### Blocking hostPath via Azure Policy

[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) allows users to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on their cluster components in a centralized, consistent manner.

There is a set of [built-in policy sets](policy-reference) for AKS that enforce best practices. Users can take advantage of one of these policies to block deployments that attempt to mount hostPaths.

## Next steps

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service control plane metrics (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to monitor the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane by using control plane metrics in Azure Monitor.

AKS supports a subset of control plane metrics free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks#aks-monitoring-data-metrics-logs-integrations). The control plane metrics feature gives you visibility into the availability and performance of critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, the scheduler, the autoscaler, and the controller manager in AKS. The feature is also fully compatible with the managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana. You can use these metrics to maximize overall observability and to maintain operational excellence for your AKS cluster.

## Control plane platform metrics

AKS offers some free control plane metrics for monitoring the API server and etcd. These metrics are automatically collected for all AKS clusters at no cost. You can analyze the metrics by using the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) in the Azure portal. You can also create metrics-based alerts by using the metrics data.

To see the full list of supported control plane platform metrics, see the [AKS monitoring reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

## Prerequisites and limitations

- The control plane metrics (preview) feature supports only the
[managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)in Azure Monitor. [Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/private-link-security)isn't supported.- You can customize only the default
configmap file. No other customization is supported.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

- Your AKS cluster must use
[managed identity authentication](use-managed-identity).

### Install the aks-preview extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install or update the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension by using theor`az extension add`

command:`az extension update`

`# Install the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview feature flag

Register the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag by using thecommand:`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show as

**Registered**.Verify the registration status by using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

When the status is

**Registered**, refresh the registration of the Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider by using thecommand:`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"`


## Enable control plane metrics on an AKS cluster

Enable control plane metrics by using the managed service for Prometheus add-on when you create a new cluster or update an existing cluster.

Note

Unlike the metrics that are collected from cluster nodes, control plane metrics are collected by a component that isn't part of the `ama-metrics`

add-on. Enabling the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag and the managed service for Prometheus add-on ensures that control plane metrics are collected. After you enable metrics collection, it can take several minutes for the data to appear in the workspace.

### New AKS cluster

To learn how to collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from your AKS cluster, see [Enable Prometheus and Grafana for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana). For an AKS cluster, complete the steps described on the **CLI** tab.

### Existing AKS cluster

If your cluster already has the managed service for Prometheus add-on, update the cluster to ensure that it collects control plane metrics by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command:

```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Query control plane metrics

Control plane metrics are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace in the cluster's region. You can query the metrics directly in the workspace or by using the Azure Managed Grafana instance that's connected to the workspace.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your AKS cluster resource.On the left menu, select

**Monitor**>**Monitor Settings**.Go to the Azure Monitor workspace that is linked to the cluster.

In the Azure Monitor workspace, under

**Managed Prometheus**, query the metrics by using the Prometheus explorer.

Note

AKS provides dashboard templates to help you view and analyze your control plane telemetry data in real time. If you use Azure Managed Grafana to visualize the data, you can import the following dashboards:

## Customize control plane metrics

AKS includes a preconfigured set of metrics to collect and store for each component. Metrics for the API server and etcd are collected by default. You can customize the list of metrics that are collected by modifying the [ ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) configmap file.

Default targets include the following values:

```
controlplane-apiserver = true
controlplane-cluster-autoscaler = false
controlplace-node-auto-provisioning = false
controlplane-kube-scheduler = false
controlplane-kube-controller-manager = false
controlplane-etcd = true
```


All configmap files should be applied to the `kube-system`

namespace for any cluster.

### Customize an ingestion profile

You can customize an ingestion file for collected metrics. For more information, see [Minimal ingestion profile for control plane metrics in managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration-minimal#minimal-ingestion-for-default-on-targets).

#### Ingest only minimal metrics from default targets

- Set
`default-targets-metrics-keep-list.minimalIngestionProfile`

to`true`

, so it ingests only the minimal set of metrics for each of the default targets:`controlplane-apiserver`

and`controlplane-etcd`

.

#### Ingest all metrics from all targets

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`false`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplace-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Apply the configmap file by using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest more than minimal metrics

Using the `minimalingestionprofile`

setting helps reduce the ingestion volume of metrics. If set to `true`

, only default recording rules, default alerts, and metrics that appear in the default dashboards are collected.

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`true`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplane-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Under

`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

, specify the list of metrics for the`true`

targets.For example:

`controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds|apiserver_longrunning_requests"`

Apply the configmap file by using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest specific metrics from specific targets

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`false`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets that you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplane-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Under

`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

, specify the list of metrics for the`true`

targets.For example:

`controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds|apiserver_longrunning_requests"`

Apply the configmap file:

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

## Troubleshoot control plane metrics issues

Make sure that the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag is enabled and that the `ama-metrics`

pods are running.

Note

The [troubleshooting methods](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot) for the managed service for Prometheus don't apply directly in this scenario. The components that scrape the control plane aren't included in the managed service for Prometheus add-on.

**Configmap file formatting**: Make sure that you use the correct formatting in the configmap file. Verify that the fields`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

,`minimal-ingestion-profile`

, and`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

and other fields are correctly populated with their intended values.**Isolate the control plane from the data plane**: Start by setting some of the[node-related metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default)to`true`

, and then verify that the metrics are forwarded to the workspace. Completing these steps helps you determine whether an issue is specific to scraping control plane metrics.**A change in the number of events ingested**: After you apply the changes, you can open the metrics explorer in the Azure portal. Go to the Azure Monitor overview pane for the cluster or go to the**Monitoring**section of the selected cluster. Check for an increase or a decrease in the number of events ingested per minute. This information can help you determine whether a specific metric is missing or if all metrics are missing.**A specific metric isn't exposed**: In some scenarios, a metric is documented, but it isn't exposed from the target and isn't forwarded to the Azure Monitor workspace. In this case, it's necessary to verify that other metrics are forwarded to the workspace.Note

If you want to collect the

`apiserver_request_duration_seconds`

metric or another bucket metric, you must set the entire series in the histogram family:`controlplane-apiserver = "apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count"`

**No access to the Azure Monitor workspace**: When you enable the add-on, you might specify an existing workspace that you can't access. In that scenario, it appears that metrics aren't collected and forwarded. Make sure that you create a new workspace to use to collect metrics when you enable the add-on or when you create the cluster.

## Disable control plane metrics on your AKS cluster

You can disable control plane metrics at any time by disabling the managed service for Prometheus add-on and unregistering the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag.

Remove the metrics add-on that scrapes Prometheus metrics by using the

command:`az aks update`

`az aks update --disable-azure-monitor-metrics --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

To disable scraping control plane metrics on the AKS cluster, unregister the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag via thecommand:`az feature unregister`

`az feature unregister "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`


## Frequently asked questions

### Can I scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus?

No. Currently, you can't scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus. Self-hosted Prometheus can scrape only a single instance, depending on the load balancer, so the metrics aren't reliable. Often, multiple replicas of the control plane metrics are visible only through the managed service for Prometheus.

### Why isn't the user agent available in the control plane metrics?

In AKS, [control plane metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/) don't have the user agent. The user agent is available only through the control plane logs that you access in [diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

# Best practices for network connectivity and security in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you provide network connectivity for your nodes and applications. These network resources include IP address ranges, load balancers, and ingress controllers.

This best practices article focuses on network connectivity and security for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Explain Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) network mode in AKS.
- Plan for required IP addressing and connectivity.
- Distribute traffic using load balancers, ingress controllers, or a web application firewall (WAF).
- Securely connect to cluster nodes.

## Choose the appropriate network model


Best practice guidanceUse Azure CNI networking in AKS for integration with existing virtual networks or on-premises networks. This network model allows greater separation of resources and controls in an enterprise environment.


Virtual networks provide the basic connectivity for AKS nodes and customers to access your applications. There are two different ways to deploy AKS clusters into virtual networks:

**Azure CNI networking**: Deploys into a virtual network and uses the[Azure CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md)Kubernetes plugin. Pods receive individual IPs that can route to other network services or on-premises resources.

Azure CNI is a valid option for production deployments.

### CNI Networking

Azure CNI is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. It assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network. There's no need for extra routing to communicate with other resources or services.

Notably, Azure CNI networking for production allows for separation of control and management of resources. From a security perspective, you often want different teams to manage and secure those resources. With Azure CNI networking, you connect to existing Azure resources, on-premises resources, or other services directly via IP addresses assigned to each pod.

When you use Azure CNI networking, the virtual network resource is in a separate resource group to the AKS cluster. Delegate permissions for the AKS cluster identity to access and manage these resources. The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network.

If you wish to define a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


By default, AKS uses a managed identity for its cluster identity. However, you can use a service principal instead.

- For more information about AKS service principal delegation, see
[Delegate access to other Azure resources](kubernetes-service-principal#delegate-access-to-other-azure-resources). - For more information about managed identities, see
[Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

As each node and pod receives its own IP address, plan out the address ranges for the AKS subnets. Keep the following criteria in mind:

- The subnet must be large enough to provide IP addresses for every node, pod, and network resource you deploy.
- With Azure CNI networking, each running node has default limits to the number of pods.

- Avoid using IP address ranges that overlap with existing network resources.
- It's necessary to allow connectivity to on-premises or peered networks in Azure.

- To handle scale-out events or cluster upgrades, you need extra IP addresses available in the assigned subnet.
- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see
[Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see

To calculate the IP address required, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

When creating a cluster with Azure CNI networking, you specify other address ranges for the cluster, such as the Docker bridge address, DNS service IP, and service address range. In general, make sure these address ranges don't overlap each other or any networks associated with the cluster, including any virtual networks, subnets, on-premises and peered networks.

For the specific details around limits and sizing for these address ranges, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

## Distribute ingress traffic


Best practice guidanceTo distribute HTTP or HTTPS traffic to your applications, use ingress resources and controllers. Compared to an Azure load balancer, ingress controllers provide extra features and can be managed as native Kubernetes resources.


While an Azure load balancer can distribute customer traffic to applications in your AKS cluster, it's limited in understanding that traffic. A load balancer resource works at *layer 4* and distributes traffic based on protocol or ports.

Most web applications using HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at *layer 7*. Ingress can distribute traffic based on the URL of the application and handle TLS/SSL termination. Ingress also reduces the number of IP addresses you expose and map.

With a load balancer, each application typically needs a public IP address assigned and mapped to the service in the AKS cluster. With an ingress resource, a single IP address can distribute traffic to multiple applications.

There are two components for ingress:

- An ingress
*resource* - An ingress
*controller*

### Ingress resource

The *ingress resource* is a YAML manifest of `kind: Ingress`

. It defines the host, certificates, and rules to route traffic to services running in your AKS cluster.

The following example YAML manifest distributes traffic for *myapp.com* to one of two services, *blogservice* or *storeservice*, and directs the customer to one service or the other based on the URL they access.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: myapp-ingress
spec:
ingressClassName: PublicIngress
tls:
- hosts:
- myapp.com
secretName: myapp-secret
rules:
- host: myapp.com
http:
paths:
- path: /blog
backend:
service:
name: blogservice
port: 80
- path: /store
backend:
service:
name: storeservice
port: 80
```


### Ingress controller

An *ingress controller* is a daemon that runs on an AKS node and watches for incoming requests. Traffic is then distributed based on the rules defined in the ingress resource. While the most common ingress controller is based on [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/kubernetes-ingress-controller), AKS doesn't restrict you to a specific controller. You can use [Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview), [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour), [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org), [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik), etc.

Ingress controllers must be scheduled on a Linux node. Indicate that the resource should run on a Linux-based node using a node selector in your YAML manifest or Helm chart deployment. For more information, see [Use node selectors to control where pods are scheduled in AKS](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-selectors).

## Ingress with the application routing addon

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed, ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing add-on, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Secure traffic with a web application firewall (WAF)


Best practice guidanceTo scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as

[Barracuda WAF for Azure]or[Azure Application Gateway for Containers]. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic TLS termination.

Typically, an ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource in your AKS cluster that distributes traffic to services and applications. The controller runs as a daemon on an AKS node, and consumes some of the node's resources, like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In larger environments, you may want to consider the following:

- Offload some of this traffic routing or TLS termination to a network resource outside of the AKS cluster.
- Scan incoming traffic for potential attacks.

For that extra layer of security, a web application firewall (WAF) filters the incoming traffic. With a set of rules, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) watches for attacks like cross-site scripting or cookie poisoning. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) is a WAF that integrates with AKS clusters, locking in these security features before the traffic reaches your AKS cluster and applications.

Since other third-party solutions also perform these functions, you can continue to use existing investments or expertise in your preferred product.

Load balancer or ingress resources continually run in your AKS cluster and refine the traffic distribution. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) can be centrally managed as an ingress controller with a resource definition. To get started, [create an Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller).

## Control traffic flow with network policies


Best practice guidanceUse network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication.


Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. Network policies are a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

To use [network policies in AKS](use-network-policies), the feature can be enabled either during cluster creation or on an existing AKS cluster. If you are planning to use network policies, ensure the feature is enabled on your AKS cluster.

Note

Network policies could be used for Linux-based or Windows-based nodes and pods in AKS.

You create a network policy as a Kubernetes resource using a YAML manifest. Policies are applied to defined pods, with ingress or egress rules defining traffic flow.

The following example applies a network policy to pods with the *app: backend* label applied to them. The ingress rule only allows traffic from pods with the *app: frontend* label.

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: backend-policy
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ingress:
- from:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
```


To get started with policies, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-network-policies).

## Securely connect to nodes through a bastion host


Best practice guidanceDon't expose remote connectivity to your AKS nodes. Create a bastion host, or jump box, in a management virtual network. Use the bastion host to securely route traffic into your AKS cluster to remote management tasks.


You can complete most operations in AKS using the Azure management tools or through the Kubernetes API server. AKS nodes are only available on a private network and aren't connected to the public internet. To connect to nodes and provide maintenance and support, route your connections through a bastion host, or jump box. Verify this host lives in a separate, securely peered management virtual network to the AKS cluster virtual network.

You should also secure the management network for the bastion host. Use an [Azure ExpressRoute](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN gateway](/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) to connect to an on-premises network and control access using network security groups.

# Use multiple load balancers in Azure Kubernetes Service (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) normally provisions one Standard Load Balancer (SLB) for all `LoadBalancer`

Services in a cluster. Because each node NIC is limited to [ 300 inbound load‑balancing rules and 8 private‑link services](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#load-balancer), large clusters or port‑heavy workloads can quickly exhaust these limits.

The **multiple SLB preview** removes that bottleneck by letting you create several SLBs inside the same cluster and shard nodes and Services across them. You define *load‑balancer configurations*, each tied to a primary agent pool and optional namespace, label, or node selectors—and AKS automatically places nodes and Services on the appropriate SLB. Outbound SNAT behavior is unchanged if `outboundType`

is `loadBalancer`

. Outbound traffic still flows through the first SLB.

Use this feature to:

- Scale beyond 300 inbound rules without adding clusters.
- Isolate tenant or workload traffic by binding a dedicated SLB to its own agent pool.
- Distribute private‑link services across multiple SLBs when you approach the per‑SLB limit.

## Prerequisites

`aks-preview`

extension 18.0.0b1 or later.- Subscription feature flag
`Microsoft.ContainerService/MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

registered. - Kubernetes version 1.28 or later.
- Cluster created with
`--load-balancer-backend-pool-type nodeIP`

or update and existing cluster using`az aks update`

.

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install the aks-preview extension using the

command.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension released using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## How AKS chooses a load balancer (node & Service placement)

AKS uses multiple inputs to determine where to place nodes and expose LoadBalancer Services. These inputs are defined in each load balancer configuration and influence which SLB is selected for each resource.

| Input type | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
Primary agent pool`--primary-agent-pool-name` |
Nodes | Required. All nodes in this pool are always added to the SLB’s backend pool. Ensures each SLB has at least one healthy node. |
Node selector`--node-selector` |
Nodes | Optional. Adds any node with matching labels to the SLB, in addition to the primary pool. |
Service namespace selector`--service-namespace-selector` |
Services | Optional. Only Services in namespaces with matching labels are considered for this SLB. |
Service label selector`--service-label-selector` |
Services | Optional. Only Services with matching labels are eligible for this SLB. |
Service annotation`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-configurations` |
Services | Optional. Limits placement to one or more explicitly named SLB configurations. Without it, any matching configuration is eligible. |

Note

Selectors define eligibility. The annotation (if used) restricts the controller to a specific subset of SLBs.

### How AKS uses these inputs

The AKS control plane continuously reconciles node and Service state using the rules above:

#### Node placement

When a node is added or updated, AKS checks which SLBs it qualifies for based on primary pool and node selector.

- If multiple SLBs match, the controller picks the one with the fewest current nodes.
- The node is added to that SLB’s backend pool.

#### Service placement

When a LoadBalancer Service is created or updated:

- AKS finds SLBs whose namespace and label selectors match the Service.
- If the Service annotation is present, only those named SLBs are considered.
- SLBs that have allowServicePlacement=false or that would exceed Azure limits (300 rules or 8 private-link services) are excluded.
- Among valid options, the SLB with the fewest rules is chosen.

### externalTrafficPolicy (ETP) behavior

AKS handles Services differently depending on the value of `externalTrafficPolicy`

.

| Mode | How load balancer selection works | How backend pool membership is built | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
Cluster (default) |
The controller follows the standard placement rules described above. A single load-balancing rule targets the shared kubernetes backend pool on the chosen SLB. |
All nodes in that SLB’s `kubernetes` pool are healthy targets. Nodes without matching Pods are removed automatically by health probes. |
Same behavior as today in single-SLB clusters. |
Local |
The controller still uses the selector-based algorithm to pick an SLB, but creates a dedicated backend pool per Service instead of using the shared pool. |
Membership is synced from the Service’s `EndpointSlice` objects, so only nodes that actually host ready Pods are added. Health probes continue to use `healthCheckNodePort` to drop unhealthy nodes. |
Guarantees client IP preservation and avoids routing through nodes that lack Pods, even when nodes are sharded across multiple SLBs. |


Why a dedicated pool for ETP Local?

In multi-SLB mode, nodes that host Pods for a given Service may reside on different SLBs from the client-facing VIP. A shared backend pool would often contain zero eligible nodes, breaking traffic. By allocating a per-Service pool and syncing it from`EndpointSlice`

, AKS ensures the Service’s SLB always points at the correct nodes.

**Impact on quotas**

- Each ETP Local Service adds one backend pool and one load-balancing rule to its SLB.
- These count toward the 300-rule limit, so monitor rule usage when you have many ETP Local Services.

**No change to outbound traffic**

Outbound SNAT still flows through the first SLB’s `aksOutboundBackendPool`

when `outboundType`

is `loadBalancer`

, independent of ETP settings.

#### Optional: Rebalancing

You can manually rebalance node distribution later using `az aks loadbalancer rebalance`

.

This design lets you define flexible, label-driven routing for both infrastructure and workloads, while AKS handles placement automatically to maintain balance and avoid quota issues.

## Add the first load balancer configuration

Add a configuration named `kubernetes`

and bind it to a *primary* agent pool that always has at least one node. Removing every configuration switches the cluster back to single‑SLB mode.

Important

To enable multiple‑SLB mode you **must** add a load‑balancer configuration named `kubernetes`

and attach it to a *primary* agent pool that always has at least one ready node.

The presence of this configuration toggles multi‑SLB support; in service selection, it has no special priority and is treated like any other load balancer configuration.

If you delete every load‑balancer configuration, the cluster automatically falls back to single‑SLB mode, which can briefly disrupt service routing or SNAT flows.

Set environment variables for use throughout this tutorial. You can replace all placeholder values with your own except

`DEFAULT_LB_NAME`

, which must remain as`kubernetes`

.`RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-aks-multislb" CLUSTER_NAME="aks-multi-slb" LOCATION="westus" DEFAULT_LB_NAME="kubernetes" PRIMARY_POOL="nodepool1"`

Create resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.\`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --load-balancer-backend-pool-type nodeIP \ --node-count 3`

Add a default load balancer using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer add`

`az aks loadbalancer add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $DEFAULT_LB_NAME \ --primary-agent-pool-name $PRIMARY_POOL \ --allow-service-placement true`


## Add additional load balancers

Create tenant‑specific configurations by specifying a different primary pool plus optional namespace, label, or node selectors.

Team 1 will run its own workloads in a separate node pool. Assign a

`tenant=team1`

label so workloads can be scheduled using selectors:`TEAM1_POOL="team1pool" TEAM1_LB_NAME="team1-lb"`

Create a second node pool for team 1 using the

command.`az aks nodepool add`

`az aks nodepool add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $TEAM1_POOL \ --labels tenant=team1 \ --node-count 2`

Create a load balancer for team 1 using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer add`

`az aks loadbalancer add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $TEAM1_LB_NAME \ --primary-agent-pool-name $TEAM1_POOL \ --service-namespace-selector "tenant=team1" \ --node-selector "tenant=team1"`

Label the target namespace (e.g.,

`team1-apps`

) to match the selector using thecommand.`az aks command invoke`

`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --command " kubectl create namespace team1-apps --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f - kubectl label namespace team1-apps tenant=team1 --overwrite "`

You can now list the load balancers in the cluster to see the multiple configurations using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer list`

`az aks loadbalancer list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --output table`

Example output:

`AllowServicePlacement ETag Name PrimaryAgentPoolName ProvisioningState ResourceGroup ----------------------- ------- ---------- ---------------------- ------------------- --------------- True <ETAG> kubernetes nodepool1 Succeeded rg-aks-multislb True <ETAG> team1-lb team1pool Succeeded rg-aks-multislb`


### Deploy a Service to a specific load balancer

Add the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-configurations`

with a comma‑separated list of configuration names. If the annotation is omitted, the controller chooses automatically.

```
az aks command invoke \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--command "
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: lb-svc-1
namespace: team1-apps
labels:
app: nginx-test

"
```


### Rebalance nodes (optional)

Run a rebalance operation after scaling if rule counts become unbalanced using the [ az aks loadbalancer rebalance](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/loadbalancer#az-aks-loadbalancer-rebalance) command. This command disrupts active flows, so schedule it during a maintenance window.

```
az aks loadbalancer rebalance --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME
```


## Monitoring and troubleshooting

- Watch controller events (
`kubectl get events …`

) to confirm that Services are reconciled. - If external connectivity is blocked, open a node shell and curl the Service VIP to confirm kube‑proxy routing.

## Limitations and known issues

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| Outbound SNAT | Always uses the first SLB; outbound flows aren’t sharded. |
| Backend pool type | Create or update and existing cluster to use `nodeIP` backend pools. |
| Autoscaler zeros | A primary agent pool can’t scale to 0 nodes. |
ETP `local` Rule Growth |
Each ETP `local` Service uses its own rule and backend pool, so rule counts can grow faster than with `cluster` mode. |
| Rebalance disruption | Removing a node from a backend pool drops in‑flight connections. Plan maintenance windows. |
| Configuration reload timing | After running `az aks loadbalancer` , changes may not take effect immediately. The AKS operation finishes quickly, but the cloud-controller-manager may take longer to apply updates. Wait for the `EnsuredLoadBalancer` event to confirm the changes are active. |

## Clean up resources

Delete the resource group when you’re finished to remove the cluster and load balancers using the [ az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command.

```
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes --no-wait
```


## Next steps

The multiple SLB feature helps scale and isolate workloads at the networking layer while maintaining simplicity through Azure-managed configuration. For more information, see the following resources:

# Deploy and configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy and configure an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview). The steps in this article include:

- Create a new or update an existing AKS cluster using the Azure CLI with OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID enabled.
- Create a workload identity and Kubernetes service account.
- Configure the managed identity for token federation.
- Deploy the workload and verify authentication with the workload identity.
- Optionally grant a pod in the cluster access to secrets in an Azure key vault.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure account, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - This article requires version 2.47.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- Make sure that the identity that you're using to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more information, see
[Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity). - If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription ID in which the resources should be billed using the
command.`az account set`


Note

You can use *Service Connector* to help you configure some steps automatically. For more information, see [Tutorial: Connect to Azure storage account in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Service Connector using Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/service-connector/tutorial-python-aks-storage-workload-identity).

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_ID="$(openssl rand -hex 3)" export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_ID" export LOCATION="<your-preferred-region>" az group create --name "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --location "${LOCATION}"`


## Enable OIDC issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

You can enable OIDC issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID on a new or existing AKS cluster.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-oidc-issuer`

parameter to enable OIDC issuer and the`--enable-workload-identity`

parameter to enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following example creates a cluster with a single node:`export CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster$RANDOM_ID" az aks create \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --enable-oidc-issuer \ --enable-workload-identity \ --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the [

`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command.`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" \ --output tsv)"`

The environment variable should contain the issuer URL, similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/`

By default, the issuer is set to use the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{tenant_id}/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location to which the AKS cluster is deployed. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key, which is a randomly generated and immutable GUID for each cluster.

## Create a managed identity

Get your subscription ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az account show`

][az-account-show] command.`export SUBSCRIPTION="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"`

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME="myIdentity$RANDOM_ID" az identity create \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --location "${LOCATION}" \ --subscription "${SUBSCRIPTION}"`

The following output example shows successful creation of a managed identity:

`{ "clientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentityxxxxxx", "location": "eastus", "name": "myIdentityxxxxxx", "principalId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxxxxx", "systemData": null, "tags": {}, "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities" }`

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --query 'clientId' \ --output tsv)"`


## Create a Kubernetes service account

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}"`

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the client ID of the managed identity by applying the following manifest using the

`kubectl apply`

command:`export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="workload-identity-sa$RANDOM_ID" export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE="default" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: "${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID}" name: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" namespace: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}" EOF`

The following output shows successful creation of the workload identity:

`serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Create the federated identity credential

Create a federated identity credential between the managed identity, the service account issuer, and the subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`export FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME="myFedIdentity$RANDOM_ID" az identity federated-credential create \ --name ${FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME} \ --identity-name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --issuer "${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER}" \ --subject system:serviceaccount:"${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}":"${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \ --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

Note

It takes a few seconds for the federated identity credential to propagate after it's added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the request might fail until the cache is refreshed. To avoid this issue, you can add a slight delay after adding the federated identity credential.


For more information about federated identity credentials in Microsoft Entra, see [Overview of federated identity credentials in Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview).

## Create a key vault with Azure RBAC authorization

The following example shows how to use the Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permission model to grant the pod access to the key vault. For more information about the Azure RBAC permission model for Azure Key Vault, see [Grant permission to applications to access an Azure key vault using Azure RBAC](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide).

Create a key vault with purge protection and Azure RBAC authorization enabled using the [

`az keyvault create`

][az-keyvault-create] command. You can also use an existing key vault if it's configured for both purge protection and Azure RBAC authorization:`export KEYVAULT_NAME="keyvault-workload-id$RANDOM_ID" # Ensure the key vault name is between 3-24 characters az keyvault create \ --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --location "${LOCATION}" \ --enable-purge-protection \ --enable-rbac-authorization`

Get the key vault resource ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az keyvault show`

][az-keyvault-show] command.`export KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault show --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --query id \ --output tsv)`


### Assign RBAC permissions for key vault management

Get the caller object ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az ad signed-in-user show`

][az-ad-signed-in-user-show] command.`export CALLER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself the Azure RBAC

[Key Vault Secrets Officer](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-secrets-officer)role so that you can create a secret in the new key vault using the [`az role assignment create`

][az-role-assignment-create] command.`az role assignment create --assignee "${CALLER_OBJECT_ID}" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer" \ --scope "${KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID}"`


### Create and configure secret access

Create a secret in the key vault using the [

`az keyvault secret set`

][az-keyvault-secret-set] command.`export KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME="my-secret$RANDOM_ID" az keyvault secret set \ --vault-name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --name "${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME}" \ --value "Hello\!"`

Get the principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az identity show \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --query principalId \ --output tsv)`

Assign the

[Key Vault Secrets User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-secrets-user)role to the user-assigned managed identity using the [`az role assignment create`

][az-role-assignment-create] command. This step gives the managed identity permission to read secrets from the key vault.`az role assignment create \ --assignee-object-id "${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID}" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \ --scope "${KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID}" \ --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal`

Create an environment variable for the key vault URL using the [

`az keyvault show`

][az-keyvault-show] command:`export KEYVAULT_URL="$(az keyvault show \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name ${KEYVAULT_NAME} \ --query properties.vaultUri \ --output tsv)"`


## Deploy a verification pod and test access

Deploy a pod to verify that the workload identity can access the secret in the key vault. The following example uses the

`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go`

image, which contains a sample application that retrieves a secret from Azure Key Vault using Microsoft Entra Workload ID:`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: sample-workload-identity-key-vault namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" spec: serviceAccountName: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} containers: - image: ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go name: oidc env: - name: KEYVAULT_URL value: ${KEYVAULT_URL} - name: SECRET_NAME value: ${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME} nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/os: linux EOF`

Wait for the pod to be in the

`Ready`

state using the`kubectl wait`

command.`kubectl wait --namespace ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} --for=condition=Ready pod/sample-workload-identity-key-vault --timeout=120s`

Check that the

`SECRET_NAME`

environment variable is set in the pod using thecommand.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pod sample-workload-identity-key-vault | grep "SECRET_NAME:"`

If successful, the output should be similar to the following example:

`SECRET_NAME: ${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME}`

Verify that pods can get a token and access the resource using the

`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs sample-workload-identity-key-vault`

If successful, the output should be similar to the following example:

`I0114 10:35:09.795900 1 main.go:63] "successfully got secret" secret="Hello\\!"`

Important

Azure RBAC role assignments can take up to 10 minutes to propagate. If the pod is unable to access the secret, you might need to wait for the role assignment to propagate. For more information, see

[Troubleshoot Azure RBAC](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/troubleshooting#).

## Disable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

Disable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on the AKS cluster where it's been enabled and configured, update the AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-workload-identity`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --disable-workload-identity`


## Related content

In this article, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and configured it to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID in preparation for application workloads to authenticate with that credential. Now you're ready to deploy your application and configure it to use the workload identity with the latest version of the [Azure Identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries) client library. If you can't rewrite your application to use the latest client library version, you can [set up your application pod](workload-identity-migrate-from-pod-identity) to authenticate using managed identity with workload identity as a short-term migration solution.

The [Service Connector](/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview) integration helps simplify the connection configuration for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. It securely handles authentication and network configurations and follows best practices for connecting to Azure services. For more information, see [Connect to Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models in AKS using Microsoft Entra Workload Identity](/en-us/azure/service-connector/tutorial-python-aks-openai-workload-identity) and the [Service Connector introduction](https://blog.aks.azure.com/2024/05/23/service-connector-intro).

This article outlines the support policy for the Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Versioning and support policy

### Service mesh add-on release calendar

The Istio-based service mesh add-on release calendar indicates each revision's AKS compatibility and estimated release and deprecation dates.

New minor revisions and patches are rolled out as part of AKS releases. Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To see real-time updates of regional release status and AKS release notes containing updates about Istio revision support, visit the [AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

If using an AKS [long term-support (LTS) cluster](long-term-support), a newer revision may be declared as compatible when a previous compatible Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version's end of life. For more details, read Istio's [AKS compatibility policy](#aks-compatibility).

### Supported revisions

**Minor revision**:- At any given time, at least two revisions of the Istio-based service mesh add-on are supported.
- An older revision
`n-2`

will continue to be supported until six weeks after the newest revision`n`

starts rolling out to all regions. For example, if`asm-1-22`

just started rolling out to all regions,`asm-1-20`

will be deprecated after six weeks. - Deprecation means no new mesh installations can be done with this revision. While clusters already having this revision continue to work, for support issues and security patches, it's recommended to
[upgrade to a newer supported mesh revision](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade).

**Patch version**:- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then
[upgrade istio-proxy sidecars by restarting their workloads](istio-upgrade#patch-version-upgrade). - AKS reserves the right to deprecate patches if a critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) or security vulnerability is detected. For awareness on patch availability and any ad-hoc deprecation, refer to
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases)and visit the[AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then

### Default revision

If a revision isn't explicitly provided by user during installation, the `n-1`

revision is installed by default. For example, if `asm-1-22`

is the latest revision, the default is `asm-1-21`

.

### AKS compatibility

Each revision of the add-on is compatible with a set of AKS minor versions established by the [upstream Istio support and release calendar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases).

**AKS LTS clusters may be compatible with additional revisions beyond upstream Istio's support table.** For Istio revisions `asm-1-25`

+ and AKS LTS versions 1.28+, every supported AKS LTS version will have *at least one* compatible Istio revision.

To check the compatible AKS versions for an Istio revision, use the command [ az aks mesh get-revisions](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions):

```
az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table
```


This command has been updated to include separate `CompatibleWith`

outputs for `KubernetesOfficial`

(standard tier) and `AKSLongTermSupport`

, replacing the earlier response that only included `kubernetes`

(standard tier).

If using the Azure portal to enable the Istio add-on for an existing cluster, the available Istio revisions will be filtered based on the cluster's tier.

Each Istio add-on revision follows upstream lifecycle for end of life and patch availability. This means:

Every Istio revision will not be compatible with every AKS LTS version, but every AKS LTS version will be compatible with at least one Istio add-on revision.

If an Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version it is compatible with, a newer revision will be declared compatible with that LTS version. The add-on will need to be upgraded to stay in support.

For example, if

`asm-1-26`

is compatible with AKS LTS 1.28, and`asm-1-26`

reaches end of life,`asm-1-27`

may become compatible with 1.28 LTS instead.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked customizations

The Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS designates features and [configuration options](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values) as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

.

**Blocked**: Disallowed features and configuration options are blocked via add-on managed admission webhooks. The API server immediately publishes the error message to the user that the feature is disallowed.**Supported**: Supported features receive support from Azure support.**Allowed**: Allowed features are open and available to Istio add-on users but aren't covered by Azure support.

# Best practices for application developers to manage resources in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few key areas to consider. The way you manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services you provide.

This article focuses on running your clusters and workloads from an application developer perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

This article covers the following topics:

- Pod resource requests and limits.
- Ways to develop, debug, and deploy applications with Bridge to Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code.

## Define pod resource requests and limits


Best practice guidanceSet pod requests and limits on all pods in your YAML manifests. If the AKS cluster uses

resource quotasand you don't define these values, your deployment may be rejected.

Use pod requests and limits to manage compute resources within an AKS cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler of the compute resources to assign to a pod.

### Pod CPU/Memory requests

*Pod requests* define a set amount of CPU and memory the pod needs regularly.

In your pod specifications, it's important you define these requests and limits based on the above information. If you don't include these values, the Kubernetes scheduler can't consider the resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

Monitor the performance of your application to adjust pod requests. If you underestimate pod requests, your application may receive degraded performance due to over-scheduling a node. If requests are overestimated, your application may have increased scheduling difficulty.

### Pod CPU/Memory limits

*Pod limits* set the maximum amount of CPU and memory a pod can use. *Memory limits* define which pods should be removed when nodes are unstable due to insufficient resources. Without proper limits set, pods are removed until resource pressure is lifted. While a pod may exceed the *CPU limit* periodically, the pod isn't removed for exceeding the CPU limit.

Pod limits define when a pod loses control of resource consumption. When it exceeds the limit, the pod is marked for removal. This behavior maintains node health and minimizes impact to pods sharing the node. If you don't set a pod limit, it defaults to the highest available value on a given node.

Avoid setting a pod limit higher than your nodes can support. Each AKS node reserves a set amount of CPU and memory for the core Kubernetes components. Your application may try to consume too many resources on the node for other pods to successfully run.

Monitor the performance of your application at different times during the day or week. Determine peak demand times and align the pod limits to the resources required to meet maximum needs.

Important

In your pod specifications, define these requests and limits based on the above information. Failing to include these values prevents the Kubernetes scheduler from accounting for resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

If the scheduler places a pod on a node with insufficient resources, application performance is degraded. Cluster administrators **must set resource quotas** on a namespace that requires you to set resource requests and limits. For more information, see

[resource quotas on AKS clusters](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas).

When you define a CPU request or limit, the value is measured in CPU units.

*1.0*CPU equates to one underlying virtual CPU core on the node.- The same measurement is used for GPUs.

- You can define fractions measured in millicores. For example,
*100 m*is*0.1*of an underlying vCPU core.

In the following basic example for a single NGINX pod, the pod requests *100 m* of CPU time and *128Mi* of memory. The resource limits for the pod are set to *250 m* CPU and *256Mi* memory.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
- name: mypod
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
resources:
requests:
cpu: 100m
memory: 128Mi
limits:
cpu: 250m
memory: 256Mi
```


For more information about resource measurements and assignments, see [Managing compute resources for containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/).

## Develop and debug applications against an AKS cluster


Best practice guidanceDevelopment teams should deploy and debug against an AKS cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes.


With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can develop, debug, and test applications directly against an AKS cluster. Developers within a team collaborate to build and test throughout the application lifecycle. You can continue to use existing tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Using integrated development and test process with Bridge to Kubernetes reduces the need for local test environments like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). Instead, you develop and test against an AKS cluster, even in secured and isolated clusters.

Note

Bridge to Kubernetes is intended for use with applications running on Linux pods and nodes.

## Use the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for Kubernetes


Best practice guidanceInstall and use the VS Code extension for Kubernetes when you write YAML manifests. You can also use the extension for integrated deployment solution, which may help application owners that infrequently interact with the AKS cluster.


The [Visual Studio Code extension for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) helps you develop and deploy applications to AKS. The extension provides the following features:

Intellisense for Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and templates.

The ability to browse, deploy, and edit capabilities for Kubernetes resources from within VS Code.

Intellisense checks for resource requests or limits being set in the pod specifications:


## Next steps

This article focused on how to run your cluster and workloads from a cluster operator perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

# Best practices for authentication and authorization in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you deploy and maintain clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you implement ways to manage access to resources and services. Without these controls:

- Accounts could have access to unnecessary resources and services.
- Tracking credentials used to make changes can be difficult.

In this article, we discuss what recommended practices a cluster operator can follow to manage access and identity for AKS clusters. You'll learn how to:

- Authenticate AKS cluster users with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Control access to resources with Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC).
- Use Azure RBAC to granularly control access to the AKS resource, the Kubernetes API at scale, and the
`kubeconfig`

. - Use a
[workload identity](workload-identity-overview)to access Azure resources from your pods.

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

## Use Microsoft Entra ID


Best practice guidanceDeploy AKS clusters with

[Microsoft Entra integration]. Using Microsoft Entra ID centralizes the identity management layer. Any change in user account or group status is automatically updated in access to the AKS cluster. Scope users or groups to the minimum permissions amount using[Roles, ClusterRoles, or Bindings].

Your Kubernetes cluster developers and application owners need access to different resources. Kubernetes lacks an identity management solution for you to control the resources with which users can interact. Instead, you can integrate your cluster with an existing identity solution like Microsoft Entra ID, an enterprise-ready identity management solution.

With Microsoft Entra integrated clusters in AKS, you create *Roles* or *ClusterRoles* defining access permissions to resources. You then *bind* the roles to users or groups from Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more about these Kubernetes RBAC in [the next section](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac). Microsoft Entra integration and how you control access to resources can be seen in the following diagram:

- Developer authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID.
- The Microsoft Entra token issuance endpoint issues the access token.
- The developer performs an action using the Microsoft Entra token, such as
`kubectl create pod`

. - Kubernetes validates the token with Microsoft Entra ID and fetches the developer's group memberships.
- Kubernetes RBAC and cluster policies are applied.
- The developer's request is successful based on previous validation of Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC and policies.

To create an AKS cluster that uses Microsoft Entra ID, see [Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](enable-authentication-microsoft-entra-id).

## Use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)


Best practice guidanceDefine user or group permissions to cluster resources with Kubernetes RBAC. Create roles and bindings that assign the least amount of permissions required. Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID to automatically update any user status or group membership change and keep access to cluster resources current.


In Kubernetes, you provide granular access control to cluster resources. You define permissions at the cluster level, or to specific namespaces. You determine what resources can be managed and with what permissions. You then apply these roles to users or groups with a binding. For more information about *Roles*, *ClusterRoles*, and *Bindings*, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity).

For example, you create a role with full access to resources in the namespace named *finance-app*, as shown in the following example YAML manifest:

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role
namespace: finance-app
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
resources: ["*"]
verbs: ["*"]
```


You then create a *RoleBinding* and bind the Microsoft Entra user *developer1@contoso.com* to it, as shown in the following YAML manifest:

```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role-binding
namespace: finance-app
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer1@contoso.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: finance-app-full-access-role
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


When *developer1@contoso.com* is authenticated against the AKS cluster, they have full permissions to resources in the *finance-app* namespace. In this way, you logically separate and control access to resources. Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID-integration.

To learn how to use Microsoft Entra groups to control access to Kubernetes resources using Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using role-based access control and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

## Use Azure RBAC


Best practice guidanceUse Azure RBAC to define the minimum required user and group permissions to AKS resources in one or more subscriptions.


There are two levels of access needed to fully operate an AKS cluster:

Access the AKS resource on your Azure subscription.

This access level allows you to:

- Control scaling or upgrading your cluster using the AKS APIs
- Pull your
`kubeconfig`

.

To learn how to control access to the AKS resource and the

`kubeconfig`

, see[Limit access to cluster configuration file](control-kubeconfig-access).Access to the Kubernetes API.

This access level is controlled either by:

[Kubernetes RBAC](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac)(traditionally) or- By integrating Azure RBAC with AKS for kubernetes authorization.

To learn how to granularly grant permissions to the Kubernetes API using Azure RBAC, see

[Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization](manage-azure-rbac).

## Use pod-managed identities

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

Don't use fixed credentials within pods or container images, as they are at risk of exposure or abuse. Instead, use *pod identities* to automatically request access using Microsoft Entra ID.

To access other Azure resources, like Azure Cosmos DB, Key Vault, or Blob storage, the pod needs authentication credentials. You could define authentication credentials with the container image or inject them as a Kubernetes secret. Either way, you would need to manually create and assign them. Usually, these credentials are reused across pods and aren't regularly rotated.

With pod-managed identities (preview) for Azure resources, you automatically request access to services through Microsoft Entra ID. Pod-managed identities is currently in preview for AKS. Refer to the [Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (Preview)](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) documentation to get started.

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) supports two modes of operation:

**Standard**mode: In this mode, the following 2 components are deployed to the AKS cluster:[Managed Identity Controller(MIC)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/mic/): A Kubernetes controller that watches for changes to pods,[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)through the Kubernetes API Server. When it detects a relevant change, the MIC adds or deletes[AzureAssignedIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureassignedidentity/)as needed. Specifically, when a pod is scheduled, the MIC assigns the managed identity on Azure to the underlying virtual machine scale set used by the node pool during the creation phase. When all pods using the identity are deleted, it removes the identity from the virtual machine scale set of the node pool, unless the same managed identity is used by other pods. The MIC takes similar actions when AzureIdentity or AzureIdentityBinding are created or deleted.[Node Managed Identity (NMI)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/): is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. NMI intercepts security token requests to the[Azure Instance Metadata Service](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/instance-metadata-service?tabs=linux)on each node. It redirects requests to itself and validates if the pod has access to the identity it's requesting a token for, and fetch the token from the Microsoft Entra tenant on behalf of the application.

**Managed**mode: In this mode, there's only NMI. The identity needs to be manually assigned and managed by the user. For more information, see[Pod Identity in Managed Mode](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/configure/pod_identity_in_managed_mode/). In this mode, when you use the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command to add a pod identity to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, it creates the[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)in the namespace specified by the`--namespace`

parameter, while the AKS resource provider assigns the managed identity specified by the`--identity-resource-id`

parameter to virtual machine scale set of each node pool in the AKS cluster.

Note

If you instead decide to install the Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity using the [AKS cluster add-on](use-azure-ad-pod-identity), setup uses the `managed`

mode.

The `managed`

mode provides the following advantages over the `standard`

:

- Identity assignment on the virtual machine scale set of a node pool can take up 40-60s. With cronjobs or applications that require access to the identity and can't tolerate the assignment delay, it's best to use
`managed`

mode as the identity is pre-assigned to the virtual machine scale set of the node pool. Either manually or using the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command. - In
`standard`

mode, MIC requires write permissions on the virtual machine scale set used by the AKS cluster and`Managed Identity Operator`

permission on the user-assigned managed identities. When running in`managed mode`

, since there's no MIC, the role assignments aren't required.

Instead of manually defining credentials for pods, pod-managed identities request an access token in real time, using it to access only their assigned resources. In AKS, there are two components that handle the operations to allow pods to use managed identities:

**The Node Management Identity (NMI) server**is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. The NMI server listens for pod requests to Azure services.**The Azure Resource Provider**queries the Kubernetes API server and checks for an Azure identity mapping that corresponds to a pod.

When pods request a security token from Microsoft Entra ID to access to an Azure resource, network rules redirect the traffic to the NMI server.

The NMI server:

- Identifies pods requesting access to Azure resources based on their remote address.
- Queries the Azure Resource Provider.

The Azure Resource Provider checks for Azure identity mappings in the AKS cluster.

The NMI server requests an access token from Microsoft Entra ID based on the pod's identity mapping.

Microsoft Entra ID provides access to the NMI server, which is returned to the pod.

- This access token can be used by the pod to then request access to resources in Azure.


In the following example, a developer creates a pod that uses a managed identity to request access to Azure SQL Database:

- Cluster operator creates a service account to map identities when pods request access to resources.
- The NMI server is deployed to relay any pod requests, along with the Azure Resource Provider, for access tokens to Microsoft Entra ID.
- A developer deploys a pod with a managed identity that requests an access token through the NMI server.
- The token is returned to the pod and used to access Azure SQL Database

To use Pod-managed identities, see [Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (preview)](use-azure-ad-pod-identity).

# Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

This article aims to provide a simplistic understanding of how to identify OSM configurations and translate them to equivalent Istio configurations for migrating workloads from OSM to Istio. This by no means, is considered to be an exhaustive detailed guide.

This article provides practical guidance for mapping OSM policies to the [Istio](https://istio.io/) policies to help migrate your microservices deployments managed by OSM over to being managed by Istio. We utilize the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) as a base reference for current OSM users. The following walk-through deploys the Bookstore application. The same steps are followed and explain how to apply the OSM [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) traffic policies using the Istio equivalent.

If you are not using OSM and are new to Istio, start with [Istio's own Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to learn how to use the Istio service mesh for your applications. If you are currently using OSM, make sure you are familiar with the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) walk-through on how OSM configures traffic policies. The following walk-through does not duplicate the current documentation, and reference specific topics when relevant. You should be comfortable and fully aware of the bookstore application architecture before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- The OSM AKS add-on is uninstalled from your AKS cluster
- Any existing OSM Bookstore application, including namespaces, is uninstalled and deleted from your cluster
[Install the Istio AKS service mesh add-on](istio-deploy-addon)

## Modifications needed to the OSM Sample Bookstore Application

To allow for Istio to manage the OSM bookstore application, there are a couple of changes needed in the existing manifests. Those changes are with the bookstore and the mysql services.

### Bookstore Modifications

In the OSM Bookstore walk-through, the bookstore service is deployed along with another bookstore-v2 service to demonstrate how OSM provides traffic shifting. This deployed services allowed you to split the client (`bookbuyer`

) traffic between multiple service endpoints. The first new concept to understand how Istio handles what they refer to as [Traffic Shifting](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/).

OSM implementation of traffic shifting is based on the [SMI Traffic Split specification](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha4/traffic-split.md). The SMI Traffic Split specification requires the existence of multiple top-level services that are added as backends with the desired weight metric to shift client requests from one service to another. Istio accomplishes traffic shifting using a combination of a [Virtual Service](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) and a [Destination Rule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/). It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with both the concepts of a virtual service and destination rule.

Put simply, the Istio virtual service defines routing rules for clients that request the host (service name). Virtual Services allows for multiple versions of a deployment to be associated to one virtual service hostname for clients to target. Multiple deployments can be labeled for the same service, representing different versions of the application behind the same hostname. The Istio virtual service can then be configured to weight the request to a specific version of the service. The available versions of the service are configured to use the `subsets`

attribute in an Istio destination rule.

The modification made to the bookstore service and deployment for Istio removes the need to have an explicit second service to target, which the SMI Traffic Split needs. There's no need for another service account for the bookstore v2 service as well, since it's to be consolidated under the bookstore service. The original OSM [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest modification to Istio for both the bookstore v1 and v2 are shown in the below [Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts](#create-pods-services-and-service-accounts) section. We demonstrate how we do traffic splitting, known as traffic shifting later in the walk-through:

### MySql Modifications

Changes to the mysql stateful set are only needed in the service configuration. Under the service specification, OSM needed the `targetPort`

and `appProtocol`

attributes. These attributes are not needed for Istio. The following updated service for the mysqldb looks like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: mysqldb
labels:
app: mysqldb
service: mysqldb
spec:
ports:
- port: 3306
name: tcp
selector:
app: mysqldb
```


## Deploy the Modified Bookstore Application

Similar to the OSM Bookstore walk-through, we start with a new install of the bookstore application.

### Create the Namespaces

```
kubectl create namespace bookstore
kubectl create namespace bookbuyer
kubectl create namespace bookthief
kubectl create namespace bookwarehouse
```


### Add a namespace label for Istio sidecar injection

For OSM, using the command `osm namespace add <namespace>`

created the necessary annotations to the namespace for the OSM controller to add automatic sidecar injection. With Istio, you only need to just label a namespace to allow the Istio controller to be instructed to automatically inject the Envoy sidecar proxies.

```
kubectl label namespace bookstore istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookbuyer istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookthief istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookwarehouse istio-injection=enabled
```


### Deploy the Istio Virtual Service and Destination Rule for Bookstore

As mentioned earlier in the Bookstore Modification section, Istio handles traffic shifting utilizing a VirtualService weight attribute we configure later in the walk-through. We deploy the virtual service and destination rule for the bookstore service. We deploy only the bookstore version 1 even though the bookstore version 2 is deployed. The Istio virtual service is only supplying a route to the version 1 of bookstore. Different from how OSM handles traffic shifting (traffic split), OSM deployed another service for the bookstore version 2 application. OSM needed to set up traffic to be split between client requests using a TrafficSplit. When using traffic shifting with Istio, we can reference shifting traffic to multiple Kubernetes application deployments (versions) labeled for the same service.

In this walk-though, the deployment of both bookstore versions (v1 & v2) is deployed at the same time. Only the version 1 is reachable due to the virtual service configuration. There is no need to deploy another service for bookstore version 2, we enable a route to the bookstore version 2 later when we update the bookstore virtual service and provide the necessary weight attribute to do traffic shifting.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookstore-virtualservice
namespace: bookstore
spec:
hosts:

spec:
host: bookstore
subsets:
- name: v1
labels:
app: bookstore
version: v1
- name: v2
labels:
app: bookstore
version: v2
EOF
```


### Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts

We use a single manifest file that contains the modifications discussed earlier in the walk-through to deploy the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, `bookwarehouse`

, and `mysql`

applications.

```

### View the Application UIs

Similar to the original OSM walk-through, if you have the OSM repo cloned you can utilize the port forwarding scripts to view the UIs of each application [here](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/#view-the-application-uis). For now, we are only concerned to view the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI.

```
cp .env.example .env
bash <<EOF
./scripts/port-forward-bookbuyer-ui.sh &
./scripts/port-forward-bookthief-ui.sh &
wait
EOF
```


In a browser, open up the following urls:

http://localhost:8080 - bookbuyer

http://localhost:8083 - bookthief

## Configure Istio's Traffic Policies

To maintain continuity with the original OSM Bookstore walk-through for the translation to Istio, we discuss [OSM's Permissive Traffic Policy Mode](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/traffic_policies/#permissive-traffic-policy-mode). OSM's permissive traffic policy mode was a concept of allowing or denying traffic in the mesh without any specific [SMI Traffic Access Control rule](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha3/traffic-access.md) deployed. The permissive traffic mode configuration existed to allow users to onboard applications into the mesh, while gaining mTLS encryption, without requiring explicit rules to allow applications in the mesh to communicate. The permissive traffic mode feature was to avoid breaking the communications of your application as soon as OSM managed it, and provide time to define your rules while ensuring that application communications was mTLS encrypted. This setting could be set to `true`

or `false`

via OSM's MeshConfig.

Istio handles mTLS enforcement differently. Different from OSM, Istio's permissive mode automatically configures sidecar proxies to use mTLS but allow the service to accept both plaintext and mTLS traffic. The equivalent to OSM's permissive mode configuration is to utilize Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

settings. `PeerAuthentication`

can be done granularly at the namespace or for the entire mesh. For more information on Istio's enforcement of mTLS, read the [Istio Mutual TLS Migration article](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/).

### Enforce Istio Strict Mode on Bookstore Namespaces

It is important to remember, just like OSM's permissive mode, Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

configuration is only related to the use of mTLS enforcement. Actual layer-7 policies, much like those used in OSM's HTTPRouteGroups, is handled using Istio's AuthorizationPolicy configurations you see later in the walk-through.

We granularly put the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, and `bookwarehouse`

namespaces in Istio's mTLS strict mode.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1

```


### Deploy Istio Access Control Policies

Similar to OSM's [SMI Traffic Target](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha2/traffic-access.md) and [SMI Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-specs/v1alpha4/traffic-specs.md) resources to define access control and routing policies for the applications to communicate, Istio accomplishes these similar fine-grain controls by using `AuthorizationPolicy`

configurations.

Let's walk through translating the bookstore TrafficTarget policy, which specifically allows the `bookbuyer`

to communicate to it, with only certain layer-7 path, headers, and methods. The following is a portion of the [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest.

```
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
destination:
kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
rules:
- kind: HTTPRouteGroup
name: bookstore-service-routes
matches:
- buy-a-book
- books-bought
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
---
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


If you notice under the TrafficTarget policy, in the spec is where you can explicitly define what source service can communicate with a destination service. We can see that we are allowing the source `bookbuyer`

to be authorized to communicate to the destination bookstore. If we translate the service-to-service authorization from an OSM `TrafficTarget`

configuration to an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

, it looks like this below:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
```


In the Istio's `AuthorizationPolicy`

, you notice how the OSM TrafficTarget policy destination service is mapped to the selector label match and the namespace the service resides in. The source service is shown under the rules section where there is a source/principles attribute that maps to the service account name for the `bookbuyer`

service.

In addition to just the source/destination configuration in the OSM TrafficTarget, OSM binds the use of an HTTPRouteGroup to further define the layer-7 authorization the source has access to. We can see in just the portion of the HTTPRouteGroup below. There are two `matches`

for the allowed source service.

```
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


There is a `match`

named `books-bought`

that allows the source to access path `/books-bought`

using a `GET`

method with host header user-agent and client-app information, and a `buy-a-book`

match that uses a regex express for a path containing `.*a-book.*new`

using a `GET`

method.

We can define these OSM HTTPRouteGroup configurations in the rules section of the Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

shown below:

```
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "bookstore"
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
- source:
namespaces: ["bookbuyer"]
to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
paths: ["*/books-bought", "*/buy-a-book/new"]
- when:
- key: request.headers[User-Agent]
values: ["*-http-client/*"]
- key: request.headers[Client-App]
values: ["bookbuyer"]
```


We can now deploy the OSM migrated traffic-access-v1.yaml manifest as understood by Istio below. There is not an `AuthorizationPolicy`

for the bookthief, so the bookthief UI should stop incrementing books from bookstore v1:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

EOF
```


### Allowing the Bookthief Application to access Bookstore

Currently there is no `AuthorizationPolicy`

that allows for the bookthief to communicate with bookstore. We can deploy the following `AuthorizationPolicy`

to allow the bookthief to communicate to the bookstore. You notice the addition for the rule for the bookstore policy that allows the bookthief authorization.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
##################################################################################################
# bookstore policy

- source:

- source:
namespaces: ["bookwarehouse"]
to:
- operation:
ports: ["3306"]
EOF
```


The bookthief UI should now be incrementing books from bookstore v1.

## Configure Traffic Shifting between two Service Versions

To demonstrate how to balance traffic between two versions of a Kubernetes service, known as traffic shifting in Istio. As you recall in a previous section, OSM implementation of traffic shifting relied on two distinct services being deployed and adding those service names to the backend configuration of the `TrafficTarget`

policy. This deployment architecture is not needed for how Istio implements traffic shifting. With Istio, we can create multiple deployments that represent each version of the service application and shift traffic to those specific versions via the Istio `virtualservice`

configuration.

The currently deployed `virtualservice`

only has a route rule to the v1 version of the bookstore shown below:

```
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
```


We update the `virtualservice`

to shift 100% of the weight to the v2 version of the bookstore.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookstore-virtualservice
namespace: bookstore
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
weight: 0
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v2
weight: 100
EOF
```


You should now see both the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI incrementing for the `bookstore`

v2 service only. You can continue to experiment by changing the `weigth`

attribute to shift traffic between the two `bookstore`

versions.

## Summary

We hope this walk-through provided the necessary guidance on how to migrate your current OSM policies to Istio policies. Take time and review the [Istio Concepts](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/) and walking through [Istio's own Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to learn how to use the Istio service mesh to manage your applications.

# Enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

If you want to create a NAP-enabled AKS cluster with a custom virtual network (VNet) and subnets, see [Create a node auto-provisioning (NAP) cluster in a custom virtual network](node-auto-provisioning-custom-vnet).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the [Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning) article, which details [how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work), [prerequisites](node-auto-provisioning#prerequisites) and [limitations](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features).

## Enable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

The following sections explain how to enable NAP on a new or existing AKS cluster:

Note

You can enable [control plane metrics](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from [node auto-provisioning](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).

### Enable NAP on a new cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

. The following command also sets the`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Create a file named

`nap.json`

and add the following ARM template configuration with the`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field set to`Auto`

, which enables NAP. (The default setting is`Manual`

.)`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Auto" } } } ] }`

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az deployment group create`

`--template-file`

flag set to the path of the ARM template file.`az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --template-file ./nap.json`


### Enable NAP on an existing cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --node-provisioning-mode Auto`


## Disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

Important

You can only disable NAP on a cluster if the following conditions are met:

- There are no existing NAP nodes. You can use the
`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command to check for existing NAP-managed nodes. - All existing Karpenter
have their`NodePools`

`spec.limits.cpu`

field set to`0`

. This action prevents new nodes from being created, but doesn't disrupt currently running nodes.

Set the

`spec.limits.cpu`

field to`0`

for every existing Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: limits: cpu: 0`

Important

If you don't want to ensure that every pod previously running on a NAP node is safely migrated to a non-NAP node before disabling NAP, you can skip steps 2 and 3 and instead use the

`kubectl delete node`

command for each NAP-managed node. However,**we don't recommend skipping these steps**, as it might leave some pods pending and doesn't honor Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs).When using the

`kubectl delete node`

command, be careful to only delete NAP-managed nodes. You can identify NAP-managed nodes using the`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command.Add the

`karpenter.azure.com/disable:NoSchedule`

taint to every Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: template: spec: ... taints: - key: karpenter.azure.com/disable effect: NoSchedule`

This action starts the process of migrating the workloads on the NAP-managed nodes to non-NAP nodes, honoring PDBs and disruption limits. Pods migrate to non-NAP nodes if they can fit. If there isn't enough fixed-size capacity, some node NAP-managed nodes remain.

Scale up existing fixed-size

`ManagedCluster`

`AgentPools`

or create new fixed-size`AgentPools`

to take the load from the node NAP-managed nodes. As these nodes are added to the cluster, the node NAP-managed nodes are drained, and work is migrated to the fixed-size nodes.Delete all NAP-managed nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command. If NAP-managed nodes still exist, the cluster likely lacks fixed-size capacity. In this case, you should add more nodes so the remaining workloads can be migrated.

Update the NAP mode to

`Manual`

using theAzure CLI command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Manual`

.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Manual`


Update the

`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field to`Manual`

in your ARM template and redeploy it.`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Manual" } } } ] }`

This article provides guidance on IP address planning for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

For specific guidance on IP address planning for individual CNI options, see the [next steps](#next-steps) section for links to plugin documentation.

## Subnet sizing

Your Azure VNet subnet must be large enough to accommodate your cluster, which depends on whether you're using an [overlay network](#overlay-networks) or a [flat network](#flat-networks).

### Overlay networks

With overlay networks, like [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay), your subnet needs to be large enough to assign IPs to your nodes. Pods are assigned IPs from a separate, private CIDR range and won't require VNet IPs. The VNet subnet you use for your cluster can be smaller than with flat networks.

It's important to ensure you allocate enough space in your private CIDR range for your pods to account for scaling. When planning your IP address range sizes, you should calculate your maximum pod count. Each node in your cluster is assigned a /24 (256 IP addresses) subnet for pods. You should plan your overlay network subnet to accommodate the maximum number of nodes you expect to run.

### Flat networks

Flat networks, like [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet), require a large enough subnet to accommodate both nodes *and* pods. Since nodes and pods receive IPs from your VNet, you need to plan for the maximum number of nodes and pods you expect to run. Azure CNI Pod Subnet uses a subnet for your nodes and a separate subnet for your pods, so you need to plan for both.

## IP address sizing

### Upgrading and scaling considerations

When IP address planning for your AKS cluster, you should **consider the number of IP addresses required for upgrade and scaling operations**. If you set the IP address range to only support a fixed number of nodes, you won't be able to upgrade or scale your cluster.

When you **upgrade** your AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node, and an older node is removed from the cluster. This rolling upgrade process requires a minimum of one additional block of IP addresses to be available. Your node count is then `n + 1`

where `n`

is the number of nodes in your cluster.

When you **scale** an AKS cluster, a new node is deployed in the cluster. Services and workloads begin to run on the new node. Your IP address range needs to take into considerations how you want to scale up the number of nodes and pods your cluster can support. A minimum of one additional node for upgrade operations or the number of nodes set by the [Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) option should also be included. Your node count is then `n + number-of-additional-scaled-nodes-you-anticipate + max surge`

.

If you're using [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) and you expect your nodes to run the maximum number of pods and you regularly destroy and deploy pods, you should also factor in extra IP addresses per node. There can be few seconds latency required to delete a service and release its IP address for a new service to be deployed and acquire the address. The extra IP addresses account for this possibility.

The IP address plan for an AKS cluster consists of a virtual network, at least one subnet for nodes and pods, and a Kubernetes service address range.

Use the following equation to calculate the minimum subnet size, including an extra node for upgrade operations: `(number of nodes + max surge nodes) + ((number of nodes + max surge nodes) * maximum pods per node that you configure)`


Example for a 50-node cluster: `(51) + (51 * 30 (default)) = 1,581`

(/21 or larger)

Example for a 50-node cluster, preparing to scale up an extra 10 nodes with the default max surge of 1 node: `(61) + (61 * 30 (default)) = 1,891`

(/21 or larger)

If you don't specify a maximum number of pods per node when you create your cluster, the maximum number of pods per node is set to 30. The minimum number of IP addresses required is based on that value. If you calculate your minimum IP address requirements on a different maximum value, see [Maximum pods per node](#maximum-pods-per-node) to set this value when you deploy your cluster.

*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*address.## Maximum pods per node

The maximum number of pods per node in an AKS cluster is 250. The *default* maximum number of pods per node varies between *kubenet* and *Azure CNI* networking, and the method of cluster deployment.

| CNI | Default max pods | Configurable at deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI Overlay | 250 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI Pod subnet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI (Legacy) | 30 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Kubenet | 110 | Yes (up to 250) |

## Configuring maximum pods per node for your clusters

You can configure the maximum number of pods per node either at cluster deployment time or as you add new node pools. You can set the maximum pods per node value as high as 250.

A minimum value for maximum pods per node is enforced to guarantee space for system pods critical to cluster health. The minimum value that can be set for maximum pods per node is 10 if and only if the configuration of each node pool has space for a minimum of 30 pods. For example, setting the maximum pods per node to the minimum of 10 requires each individual node pool to have a minimum of three nodes. This requirement applies for each new node pool created as well, so if 10 is defined as maximum pods per node each subsequent node pool added must have at least three nodes.

| Networking | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|
| Azure CNI | 10 | 250 |
| Kubenet | 10 | 250 |

Note

The minimum value in the previous table is strictly enforced by the AKS service. You cannot set a value for *maxPods* that is lower than the minimum shown, as doing so can prevent the cluster from starting.

### New clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new cluster using one of the following methods:

**Azure CLI**: Specify the`--max-pods`

argument when you deploy a cluster with thecommand.`az aks create`

**Azure Resource Manager template**: Specify the`maxPods`

property in the [ManagedClusterAgentPoolProfile] object when you deploy a cluster with an Azure Resource Manager template.**Azure portal**: Change the`Max pods per node`

field in the node pool settings when creating a cluster or adding a new node pool.

### Existing clusters

You can define maximum pods per node when you create a new node pool. If you need to increase the *maxPods* setting on an existing cluster, add a new node pool with the new desired *maxPods* count. After migrating your pods to the new pool, delete the node older pool.

# Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID in AKS

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using a Microsoft Entra authentication token. Once authenticated, you can use the built-in Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to namespaces and cluster resources based on a user's identity or group membership.

This article shows you how to:

Control access using Kubernetes RBAC in an AKS cluster based on Microsoft Entra group membership.

Create example groups and users in Microsoft Entra ID.

Create Roles and RoleBindings in an AKS cluster granting the appropriate permissions, such as to create and view resources.


## Prerequisites

You have an existing AKS cluster with Microsoft Entra integration enabled. If you need an AKS cluster with this configuration, see

[Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](managed-azure-ad).Kubernetes RBAC is enabled by default during AKS cluster creation. To upgrade an existing cluster with Microsoft Entra integration and Kubernetes RBAC, see

[Enable Microsoft Entra integration on your existing AKS cluster](managed-azure-ad#use-an-existing-cluster).Make sure that Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later is installed and configured. To find the version, run

`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).If using Terraform, install

[Terraform](/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/overview)version 2.99.0 or later.

Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to verify Microsoft Entra integration with Kubernetes RBAC is enabled.

To verify using the Azure portal:

- Sign-in to the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)and navigate to your AKS cluster resource. - In the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Security configuration**. - Under the
**Authentication and Authorization**section, verify the**Microsoft Entra authentication with Kubernetes RBAC**option is selected.

## Create groups in Microsoft Entra ID

This section teaches you how to create two user roles to show how Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID control access cluster resources. The following two example roles are:

**Application developer**- A user named
*aksdev*that's part of the*appdev*group.

- A user named
**Site reliability engineer**(SRE)- A user named
*akssre*that's part of the*opssre*group.

- A user named

In production environments, you can use existing users and groups within a Microsoft Entra tenant.

First, get the resource ID of your AKS cluster using the

command. Then, assign the resource ID to a variable named`az aks show`

*AKS_ID*so it can be referenced in other commands.`AKS_ID=$(az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query id -o tsv)`

Create the first example group in Microsoft Entra ID for the application developers using the

command. The following example creates a group named`az ad group create`

*appdev*:`APPDEV_ID=$(az ad group create --display-name appdev --mail-nickname appdev --query id -o tsv)`

Create an Azure role assignment for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This assignment lets any member of the group use`az role assignment create`

`kubectl`

to interact with an AKS cluster by granting them the*Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User*Role.`az role assignment create \ --assignee $APPDEV_ID \ --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \ --scope $AKS_ID`

Tip

If you receive an error such as

`Principal 35bfec9328bd4d8d9b54dea6dac57b82 doesn't exist in the directory a5443dcd-cd0e-494d-a387-3039b419f0d5.`

, wait a few seconds for the Microsoft Entra group object ID to propagate through the directory then try the`az role assignment create`

command again.

## Create users in Microsoft Entra ID

After you create the example Microsoft Entra ID groups for application developers and SREs, the next step is to create two corresponding user accounts. These users are used to sign in to the AKS cluster and validate the Kubernetes RBAC integration described later in this article.

Before you begin, you must set the user principal name (UPN) and password for the application developers. The UPN must include the verified domain name of your tenant. For example, an application developer user, `aksdev@contoso.com`

. In order to figure out (or set) the verified domain names in your tenant, see [Managing custom domain names in your Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/entra/identity/users/domains-manage).

The following command prompts you for the UPN and sets it to *AAD_DEV_UPN* so it can be used in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the UPN for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_UPN
```


The following command prompts you for the password and sets it to *AAD_DEV_PW* for use in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the secure password for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_PW
```


### Create user accounts

Create the first user account in Microsoft Entra ID using the

command. The following example creates a user with the display name`az ad user create`

*AKS Dev*, the UPN, and secure password using the values in*AAD_DEV_UPN*and*AAD_DEV_PW*:`AKSDEV_ID=$(az ad user create \ --display-name "AKS Dev" \ --user-principal-name $AAD_DEV_UPN \ --password $AAD_DEV_PW \ --query id -o tsv)`

Add the user to the

*appdev*group created in the previous section using thecommand:`az ad group member add`

`az ad group member add --group appdev --member-id $AKSDEV_ID`


## Create AKS cluster resources

We have our Microsoft Entra groups, users, and Azure role assignments created. Now, you configure the AKS cluster to allow these different groups access to specific resources.

Get the cluster admin credentials using the

command. In one of the following sections, you get the regular`az aks get-credentials`

*user*cluster credentials to see the Microsoft Entra authentication flow in action.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin`

Create a namespace in the AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a namespace name`kubectl create namespace`

*dev*:`kubectl create namespace dev`

Note

In Kubernetes,

*Roles*define the permissions to grant, and*RoleBindings*apply them to desired users or groups. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster. For more information, see[Using Kubernetes RBAC authorization](concepts-identity#kubernetes-rbac).If the user you grant the Kubernetes RBAC binding for is in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, assign permissions based on the

**UPN**. If the user is in a different Microsoft Entra tenant, query for and use the*objectId*property instead.Create a Role for the

*dev*namespace, which grants full permissions to the namespace. In production environments, you can specify more granular permissions for different users or groups. Create a file named`role-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:`kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-full-access namespace: dev rules: - apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"] resources: ["*"] verbs: ["*"] - apiGroups: ["batch"] resources: - jobs - cronjobs verbs: ["*"]`

Create the Role using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f role-dev-namespace.yaml`

Get the resource ID for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This group is set as the subject of a RoleBinding in the next step.`az ad group show`

`az ad group show --group appdev --query id -o tsv`

Create a RoleBinding for the

*appdev*group to use the previously created Role for namespace access. Create a file named`rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest. On the last line, replace*groupObjectId*with the group object ID output from the previous command.`kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-access namespace: dev roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: dev-user-full-access subjects: - kind: Group namespace: dev name: groupObjectId`

Tip

If you want to create the RoleBinding for a single user, specify

*kind: User*and replace*groupObjectId*with the UPN in the previous sample.Create the RoleBinding using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`


## Access AKS cluster resources with Microsoft Entra identities

Now, test that the expected permissions work when you create and manage resources in an AKS cluster. In these examples, you schedule and view pods in the user's assigned namespace, and try to schedule and view pods outside of the assigned namespace.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand. In a previous section, you set the context using the cluster admin credentials. The admin user bypasses Microsoft Entra sign-in prompts. Without the`az aks get-credentials`

`--admin`

parameter, the user context is applied that requires all requests to be authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule a basic NGINX pod using the

command in the`kubectl run`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

Enter the credentials for the

*appdev*group account (enter*your*own credentials) at the sign-in prompt. Once you're successfully signed in, the account token is cached for future`kubectl`

commands. The NGINX is successfully scheduled as shown in the following example output:`$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code B24ZD6FP8 to authenticate. pod/nginx-dev created`

Use the

command to view pods in the`kubectl get pods`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl get pods --namespace dev`

Ensure the status of the NGINX pod is

*Running*. The output looks like the following output:`$ kubectl get pods --namespace dev NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-dev 1/1 Running 0 4m`


### Test SRE access to AKS cluster resources

To confirm that our Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC work correctly between different users and groups, try the previous commands when signed in as the *akssre* user.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand that clears the previously cached authentication token for the`az aks get-credentials`

*aksdev*user.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule and view pods in the assigned

*SRE*namespace. When prompted, sign in with the*opssre*group account credentials (enter*your*own credentials).`kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre kubectl get pods --namespace sre`

As shown in the following example output, you can successfully create and view the pods:

`$ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre`

To sign in, use a web browser to open the page

[https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin)and enter the code BM4RHP3FD to authenticate.`pod/nginx-sre created $ kubectl get pods --namespace sre NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-sre 1/1 Running 0`

Try to view or schedule pods outside of assigned SRE namespace.

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

These

`kubectl`

commands fail, as shown in the following example output. The user's group membership and Kubernetes Role and RoleBindings don't grant permissions to create or manager resources in other namespaces.`$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot list pods at the cluster scope $ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create pods in the namespace "dev"`


### Create and view cluster resources outside of the assigned namespace

To view pods outside of the *dev* namespace. Use the [ kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command using

`--all-namespaces`

:```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```


The user's group membership doesn't have a Kubernetes Role that allows this action, as shown in the following example output:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "aksdev@contoso.com" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```


In the same way, schedule a pod in a different namespace, such as the *SRE* namespace. The user's group membership doesn't align with a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding to grant these permissions, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "sre"
```


### Clean up cluster resources

To clean up all of the resources, run the following commands:

```
# Get the admin kubeconfig context to delete the necessary cluster resources.
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
# Delete the dev and SRE namespaces. This also deletes the pods, Roles, and RoleBindings.
kubectl delete namespace dev
kubectl delete namespace sre
# Delete the Azure AD user accounts for aksdev and akssre.
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSDEV_ID
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSSRE_ID
# Delete the Azure AD groups for appdev and opssre. This also deletes the Azure role assignments.
az ad group delete --group appdev
az ad group delete --group opssre
```

# Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides the necessary details that allow you to secure outbound traffic from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It contains the cluster requirements for a base AKS deployment and additional requirements for optional addons and features. You can apply this information to any outbound restriction method or appliance.

To see an example configuration using Azure Firewall, visit [Control egress traffic using Azure Firewall in AKS](limit-egress-traffic).

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Background

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network. This network can either be customized and preconfigured by you or it can be created and managed by AKS. In either case, the cluster has **outbound**, or egress, dependencies on services outside of the virtual network.

For management and operational purposes, nodes in an AKS cluster need to access certain ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). These endpoints are required for the nodes to communicate with the API server or to download and install core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates. For example, the cluster needs to pull container images from Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR).

The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means you can't use network security groups (NSGs) to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound internet access. This level of network access allows nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. For outbound internet traffic, it's not recommended to set all deny rules in an NSG.

A [network isolated AKS cluster](concepts-network-isolated), provides the simplest and most secure solution for setting up outbound restrictions for a cluster out of the box. A network isolated cluster pulls the images for cluster components and add-ons from a private Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance connected to the cluster instead of pulling from MAR. If the images aren't present, the private ACR pulls them from MAR and serves them via its private endpoint, eliminating the need to enable egress from the cluster to the public MAR endpoint. The cluster operator can then incrementally set up allowed outbound traffic securely over a private network for each scenario they want to enable. This way the cluster operators have complete control over designing the allowed outbound traffic from their clusters right from the start, thus allowing them to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.

Another solution to securing outbound addresses is using a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination. You can also configure your preferred firewall and security rules to allow these required ports and addresses.

Important

This document covers only how to lock down the traffic leaving the AKS subnet. AKS has no ingress requirements by default. Blocking **internal subnet traffic** using network security groups (NSGs) and firewalls isn't supported. To control and block the traffic within the cluster, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).

## Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters

The following network and FQDN/application rules are required for an AKS cluster. You can use them if you wish to configure a solution other than Azure Firewall.

- IP address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic).
- FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
- Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your AKS cluster based on a number of qualifiers.
- AKS uses an admission controller to inject the FQDN as an environment variable to all deployments under kube-system and gatekeeper-system. This ensures all system communication between nodes and API server uses the API server FQDN and not the API server IP. You can get the same behavior on your own pods, in any namespace, by annotating the pod spec with an annotation named
`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

. If that annotation is present, AKS will set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This is useful in cases where the cluster egress is via a layer 7 firewall. - If you have an app or solution that needs to talk to the API server, you must either add an
**additional**network rule to allow**TCP communication to port 443 of your API server's IP****OR**, if you have a layer 7 firewall configured to allow traffic to the API Server's domain name, set`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

in your pod specs. - On rare occasions, if there's a maintenance operation, your API server IP might change. Planned maintenance operations that can change the API server IP are always communicated in advance.
- You might notice traffic towards "md-*.blob.storage.azure.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used for internal components of Azure Managed Disks. Blocking access to this endpoint from your firewall should not cause any issues.
- You might notice traffic towards "umsa*.blob.core.windows.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used to store manifests for Azure Linux VM Agent & Extensions and is regularly checked to download new versions. You can find more details on
[VM Extensions](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/features-linux?tabs=azure-cli#network-access).

# Concepts - Machine learning operations (MLOps) for AI and machine learning workflows

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn about machine learning operations (MLOps), including what types of practices and tools are involved, and how it can simplify and speed up your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What is MLOps?

Machine learning operations (MLOps) encompasses practices that facilitate collaboration between data scientists, IT operations, and business stakeholders, ensuring that machine learning models are developed, deployed, and maintained efficiently. MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, aiming to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes training, packaging, validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models.

MLOps requires multiple roles and tools to work together effectively. Data scientists focus on tasks related to training the model, which is referred to as the * inner loop*. Machine learning engineers and IT operations teams handle the

*, where they apply DevOps practices to package, validate, deploy, and monitor models. When the model needs fine-tuning or retraining, the process loops back to the inner loop.*

**outer loop**### MLOps pipeline

Your MLOps pipeline may leverage various tools and microservices that are deployed sequentially or in parallel. Below are examples of key components in your pipeline that benefit from implementing the following best practices to reduce overhead and allow for faster iteration:

- Unstructured data store for new data flowing into your application
- Vector database to store and query structured, pre-processed data
- Data ingestion and indexing framework
- Vector ingestion and/or model retraining workflows
- Metrics collection and alerting tools (tracking model performance, volume of ingested data, etc.)
- Lifecycle management tools

## DevOps and MLOps

DevOps is a combination of tools and practices that enable you to create robust and reproducible applications. The goal of using DevOps is to quickly deliver value to your end users. Creating, deploying, and monitoring robust and reproducible models to deliver value to end users is the primary goal of MLOps.

There are *three* processes that are essential to MLOps:

**Machine learning workloads**for which a data scientist is responsible, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training and tuning.**Software development practices**including planning, developing, testing, and packaging the model for deployment.**Operational aspects of deploying and maintaining the model in production**, including releasing, configuring resources, and monitoring the model.

### DevOps principles that apply to MLOps

MLOps leverages several principles from DevOps to enhance the machine learning lifecycle, such as *automation*, *continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)*, *source control*, *Agile planning*, and *infrastructure as code (IaC)*.

#### Automation

By automating tasks, you can reduce manual errors, increase efficiency, and ensure consistency across the ML lifecycle. Automation can be applied to various stages, including data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Through automation, you can also apply proactive measures in the AI pipeline to ensure data compliance with your organization's policies.

For example, your pipeline can automate:

- Model tuning/retraining at regular time intervals or when a certain amount of new data is collected in your application.
- Detection of performance degradation to kickstart fine-tuning or retraining on a different subset of data.
- Common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) scanning on base container images pulled from external container registries to ensure safe security practices.

#### Continuous integration (CI)

Continuous integration covers the *creating* and *verifying* aspects of the model development process. The goal of CI is to create the code and to verify the quality of the code and the model before deployment. This includes testing on a range of sample data sets to ensure that the model performs as expected and meets quality standards.

In MLOps, CI might involve:

- Refactoring exploratory code in Jupyter notebooks into Python or R scripts.
- Validating new input data for missing or error values.
- Unit testing and integration testing in the end-to-end pipeline.

To perform linting and unit testing, you can use automation tools like Azure Pipelines in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.

#### Continuous delivery (CD)

Continuous delivery involves the steps needed to safely deploy a model in production. The first step is to package and deploy the model in *pre-production environments*, such as dev and test environments. Portability of the parameters, hyperparameters, and other model artifacts is an important aspect to maintain as you promote the code through these environments. This portability is especially important when it comes to large language models (LLMs) and stable diffusion models. Once the model passes the unit tests and quality assurance (QA) tests, you can approve it for deployment in the *production environment*.

#### Source control

Source control, or *version control*, is essential for managing changes to code and models. In an ML system, this refers to data versioning, code versioning, and model versioning, which allow cross-functional teams to collaborate effectively and track changes over time. Using a Git-based source control system, like [ Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/repos/#:%7E:text=Overview.%20Free%20private%20Git%20repositories,%20pull%20requests,%20and?msockid=182ea2d5e1ff6eb61ccbb1b8e5ff608a) in Azure DevOps or a

**GitHub repository**, enables you to programmatically maintain a history of changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches for different experiments.

#### Agile planning

Agile planning involves isolating work into *sprints*, which are short time frames for completing specific tasks. This approach allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and deliver incremental improvements to the model. Model training can be an ongoing process, and Agile planning can help scope the project and enable better team alignment.

You can use tools like [ Azure Boards](/en-us/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards) in Azure DevOps or

**GitHub issues**to manage your Agile planning.

#### Infrastructure as code (IaC)

You use infrastructure as code to repeat and automate the infrastructure needed to train, deploy, and serve your models. In an ML system, IaC helps simplify and define the appropriate Azure resources needed for the specific job type in code, and the code is maintained in a repository. This allows you to version control your infrastructure and make changes for resource optimization, cost-effectiveness, etc. as needed.

# Create a fully managed GPU node pool on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you run GPU workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to install and maintain several software components, including the GPU driver, Kubernetes device plugin, and GPU metrics exporter for telemetry. These components are essential for enabling GPU scheduling, container-level GPU access, observability of resource usage, and proper functioning of AKS GPU-enabled nodes. Previously, cluster operators had to either install these components manually or use open-source alternatives like the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](nvidia-gpu-operator), which can introduce complexity and operational overhead.

AKS now supports fully managed GPU nodes (preview) and installs the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and Data Center GPU Manager [(DCGM) metrics exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/tree/main) by default. This feature enables one-step GPU node pool creation and makes the availability of GPU resources in AKS as simple as general purpose CPU nodes.

In this article, you learn how to provision a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) in your AKS cluster, including default installation of the NVIDIA GPU driver, device plugin, and metrics exporter.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.72.2 or later installed. To find the version, run
`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need to
[install and upgrade to latest version of the](#install-the-aks-preview-cli-extension).`aks-preview`

extension - You need to
[register the](#register-the-managedgpuexperiencepreview-feature-flag-in-your-subscription).`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

## Limitations

- This feature currently supports
[NVIDIA GPU-enabled virtual machine (VM) sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu)only. - Updating a general-purpose node pool to add a GPU VM size isn't supported on AKS.
- Windows node pools are not supported with this feature, because GPU metrics are not supported. When creating Windows GPU node pools, AKS automatically installs and manages the drivers and Directx device plugin. See
[AKS Windows GPU documentation](use-windows-gpu)for more information. - Migrating your existing
[multi-instance GPU](gpu-multi-instance)node pools to use this feature isn't supported. - In-place upgrades to use this feature on existing GPU-enabled nodes isn't supported.

Note

GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) tool and [region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

### Install the `aks-preview`

CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to ensure you have the latest version installed using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription

Register the

`ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`

feature flag in your subscription using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name ManagedGPUExperiencePreview`


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS-managed GPU node pool (preview)

You can add a fully managed GPU node pool (preview) to an existing AKS cluster by specifying OS SKU and `--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command. When you do this, AKS will install the GPU driver, GPU device plugin, and metrics exporter automatically.

To use the default Ubuntu operating system (OS) SKU, you create the node pool without specifying an OS SKU. The node pool is configured for the default operating system based on the Kubernetes version of the cluster.

Add a node pool to your cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

command.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource‐group MyResourceGroup \ --cluster‐name MyAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \ --node‐count 1 \ --node‐vm‐size Standard_NC6s_v3 \ --node‐taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \ --enable‐cluster‐autoscaler \ --min‐count 1 \ --max‐count 3 \ --tags EnableManagedGPUExperience=true`

Confirm that the managed NVIDIA GPU software components are installed successfully:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name gpunp \`

Your output should include the following values:

`... ... "gpuInstanceProfile": … "gpuProfile": { "driver": "Install" }, ... ...`


## Migrate existing GPU workloads to an AKS-managed GPU node pool

In-place upgrades from a standard NVIDIA GPU node pool to a fully managed NVIDIA GPU node pool (preview) on your AKS cluster isn't supported. We recommend cordoning and draining your existing GPU nodes, then redeploying your workloads to a new GPU-enabled node pool with this feature enabled. See [Resize node pools on AKS](resize-node-pool) to learn more.

## Bring your own (BYO) GPU driver

If you want to control the installation of the NVIDIA drivers or use the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html), you can bypass the GPU driver installation during node pool creation. In this case, Microsoft **doesn't support or manage** the maintenance and compatibility of the NVIDIA drivers as part of the node image deployment. See [Skip GPU driver installation](use-nvidia-gpu#skip-gpu-driver-installation) for NVIDIA GPU-enabled nodes on AKS to learn more.

## Next steps

- Deploy a
[sample GPU workload](use-nvidia-gpu#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload)on your AKS-managed GPU-enabled nodes. - Learn about
[GPU utilization and performance metrics](monitor-gpu-metrics)from managed NVIDIA DCGM exporter on your GPU node pool.

In this article, there are references to Ubuntu and Azure Linux OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS:

- Starting on
**March 17, 2027**, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by[upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to Kubernetes version 1.34+. For more information on this retirement, see[Retirement: Ubuntu 20.04 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874). - As of
**November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the[202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning**March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by[upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster)to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to[osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see[[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported OS versions

Each [node image](node-images) corresponds to an OS version, which you can specify using OS SKU. You can specify the following parameters when creating clusters and node pools:

**--os-type**: OS type, including Linux or Windows.*You can't specify the Windows OS type during cluster creation or update.***--os-sku**: Used to specify OS version or OS variant.*You can't specify the Windows OS SKU during cluster creation or update.*For more information for supported OS SKU options, see[Azure AKS CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)or[API](/en-us/rest/api/aks/agent-pools/create-or-update#ossku).**--kubernetes-version**: Version of Kubernetes to use for creating the node pool or cluster.


Best practice guidanceThe default OS version is the most recent validated version.


- For Ubuntu, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku Ubuntu`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Ubuntu version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Azure Linux, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku AzureLinux`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Azure Linux version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Windows, we recommend creating node pools while specifying
`--os-type Windows`

and`--os-sku Windows2022`

. You need to manually update node pools to the next OS version when it's released.

| OS type | OS SKU | Supported Kubernetes versions | Default versioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2404 | This OS SKU will only be supported in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.38. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you want to migrate to the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 24.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2204 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.36. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you need to roll back to Ubuntu 22.04. Ubuntu 22.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35. |
| Linux | AzureLinux | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Azure Linux 2.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.27 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.32+. When the `AzureLinuxV3Preview` feature flag is enabled on AKS 1.31, `--os-sku AzureLinux` defaults to 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinux3 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes 1.28 to 1.36. | We recommend this OS SKU if you want to test out the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You can also use this OS SKU to migrate from Azure Linux 2.0 to Azure Linux 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinuxOSGuard | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 and above. | Azure Linux with OS Guard versions are upgraded through node image upgrades. For more information, see

[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).## Migrate to a new OS version

When a new OS version releases on AKS, it's initially supported in preview. After testing in preview for a few months, AKS makes the new OS version generally available (GA) and then updates the default OS SKU (`Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

) to the latest GA OS version. This default update occurs with a new Kubernetes version release.

We recommend testing your nonproduction workloads with the new OS version when it becomes available in preview. In order to access preview functions, make sure you have the preview extension installed. You can install the extension using the `az extension add --name aks-preview`

command.

There are two ways to migrate to a new OS version:

**Default OS SKU**: If you're using a default OS SKU such as`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

, you automatically get the latest GA version when you[upgrade your Kubernetes version](manage-node-pools). There are no manual changes required to migrate to a new OS version.**Versioned OS SKU**: If you're using a versioned OS SKU such as`Ubuntu2404`

,`AzureLinux3`

, or`Windows2025`

, you need to manually migrate to a new OS version to avoid blocked Kubernetes upgrades. If you're using a Linux OS, you can update the OS SKU on an existing node pool to manually migrate.

### Update OS SKU on an existing node pool

Update the `os-sku`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command. In cases where there's a new OS version available in preview, this functionality allows you to migrate your node pool to the new OS version without needing to upgrade your Kubernetes version.

Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Migrate to Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for `--os-sku Ubuntu`

in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. You can also use Ubuntu 24.04 by specifying `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)is not supported.- Ubuntu 24.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.38.
- You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.39+.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

is an option and is intended for testing the new OS Linux version without requiring you to upgrade your Kubernetes version. - You need the preview Azure CLI version 18.0.0b5 or later for
*preview*and version 2.82.0 for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2404 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


#### Migrate to Azure Linux 3.0

Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for `--os-sku AzureLinux`

in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.36. You can also use Azure Linux 3.0 by specifying `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

:

`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.28 to 1.36.`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is intended for migrating to Azure Linux 3.0 without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.37+.- You need the Azure CLI version 18.0.0b36 or later for
*preview*and version 2.78.0 or later for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux3 \
--kubernetes-version 1.30.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


## Roll back your OS version

In Kubernetes versions where multiple OS versions are supported, you can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to roll back to a previous OS version.

You might want to roll back your OS version in the following scenarios:

- If you're testing a new OS version and you run into any issues.
- Once you upgrade to a Kubernetes version that supports the new OS version as default, you might want to roll back to the default
`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

OS SKU. This allows you to get future OS versions as a part of your Kubernetes upgrades instead of requiring a node pool update.

### Roll back your OS version to the default OS SKU

You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to update the

`os-sku`

on an existing node pool. In cases where there's a previous OS version supported in your Kubernetes version, this functionality can allow you to roll back your OS version.Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

| OS SKU | Default OS version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | When you have OS SKU `Ubuntu` , Ubuntu 22.04 is the default OS version if your Kubernetes version is 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for Ubuntu in Kubernetes 1.35 to 1.37. |
| AzureLinux | When you have OS SKU `AzureLinux` , Azure Linux 2.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.26 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.36. |

#### Update your OS SKU to Ubuntu on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `Ubuntu`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Update your OS SKU to Azure Linux on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `AzureLinux`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


### Roll back to Ubuntu 22.04

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[CVM](use-cvm)aren't supported.- Ubuntu 22.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

is intended for roll back to Ubuntu 22.04 on your current Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option to upgrade your Kubernetes version to 1.36 and above.

Roll back to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2204 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```
