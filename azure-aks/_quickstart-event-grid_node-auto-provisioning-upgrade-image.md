Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that provides uniform event consumption using a publish-subscribe model.

In this quickstart, you create an AKS cluster and subscribe to AKS events.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)or[Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)installed.

Note

AKS operations are independent of Azure Event Grid availability and aren't impacted during Event Grid [Service Outages](https://azure.status.microsoft/status).

## Create an AKS cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command. The following example creates a resource group *MyResourceGroup* and a cluster named *MyAKS* with one node in the *MyResourceGroup* resource group:

```
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
az aks create --resource-group yResourceGroup --name MyAKS --location eastus --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys
```


## Subscribe to AKS events

Create a namespace and event hub using [az eventhubs namespace create](/en-us/cli/azure/eventhubs/namespace#az-eventhubs-namespace-create) and [az eventhubs eventhub create](/en-us/cli/azure/eventhubs/eventhub#az-eventhubs-eventhub-create). The following example creates a namespace *MyNamespace* and an event hub *MyEventGridHub* in *MyNamespace*, both in the *MyResourceGroup* resource group.

```
az eventhubs namespace create --location eastus --name MyNamespace --resource-group MyResourceGroup
az eventhubs eventhub create --name MyEventGridHub --namespace-name MyNamespace --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```


Note

The *name* of your namespace must be unique.

Subscribe to the AKS events using [az eventgrid event-subscription create](/en-us/cli/azure/eventgrid/event-subscription#az-eventgrid-event-subscription-create):

```
SOURCE_RESOURCE_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyAKS --query id --output tsv)
ENDPOINT=$(az eventhubs eventhub show --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyEventGridHub --namespace-name MyNamespace --query id --output tsv)
az eventgrid event-subscription create --name MyEventGridSubscription \
--source-resource-id $SOURCE_RESOURCE_ID \
--endpoint-type eventhub \
--endpoint $ENDPOINT
```


Verify your subscription to AKS events using `az eventgrid event-subscription list`

:

```
az eventgrid event-subscription list --source-resource-id $SOURCE_RESOURCE_ID
```


The following example output shows you're subscribed to events from the *MyAKS* cluster and those events are delivered to the *MyEventGridHub* event hub:

```
[
{
"deadLetterDestination": null,
"deadLetterWithResourceIdentity": null,
"deliveryWithResourceIdentity": null,
"destination": {
"deliveryAttributeMappings": null,
"endpointType": "EventHub",
"resourceId": "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/MyNamespace/eventhubs/MyEventGridHub"
},
"eventDeliverySchema": "EventGridSchema",
"expirationTimeUtc": null,
"filter": {
"advancedFilters": null,
"enableAdvancedFilteringOnArrays": null,
"includedEventTypes": [
"Microsoft.ContainerService.NewKubernetesVersionAvailable","Microsoft.ContainerService.ClusterSupportEnded","Microsoft.ContainerService.ClusterSupportEnding","Microsoft.ContainerService.NodePoolRollingFailed","Microsoft.ContainerService.NodePoolRollingStarted","Microsoft.ContainerService.NodePoolRollingSucceeded"
],
"isSubjectCaseSensitive": null,
"subjectBeginsWith": "",
"subjectEndsWith": ""
},
"id": "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/MyAKS/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions/MyEventGridSubscription",
"labels": null,
"name": "MyEventGridSubscription",
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
"resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup",
"retryPolicy": {
"eventTimeToLiveInMinutes": 1440,
"maxDeliveryAttempts": 30
},
"systemData": null,
"topic": "/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/MyAKS",
"type": "Microsoft.EventGrid/eventSubscriptions"
}
]
```


When AKS events occur, you see those events appear in your event hub. For example, when the list of available Kubernetes versions for your clusters changes, you see a `Microsoft.ContainerService.NewKubernetesVersionAvailable`

event. There are also new events available now for upgrades and cluster within support. For more information on the events AKS emits, see [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an Event Grid source](/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-schema-aks).

## Delete the cluster and subscriptions

Use the [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command to remove the resource group, the AKS cluster, namespace, and event hub, and all related resources.

```
az group delete --name MyResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
```


Note

When you delete the cluster, the Microsoft Entra service principal used by the AKS cluster isn't removed. For steps on how to remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion](kubernetes-service-principal#considerations-when-using-a-service-principal).

If you used a managed identity, the identity is managed by the platform and doesn't require removal.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and then subscribed to AKS events in Azure Event Hubs.

# Node image updates for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of node image updates for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including how it works, recommended maintenance windows, and examples to get started.

## How do node image updates work for node auto-provisioning nodes?

By default, NAP node pool virtual machines (VMs) are automatically updated when a new image version is available. You can configure an [AKS-managed node operating system (OS) upgrade schedule maintenance window](#node-os-upgrade-maintenance-windows-for-nap) to control when new images are picked up and applied to your NAP nodes, or [use Karpenter Node Disruption Budgets and Pod Disruption Budgets](#karpenter-node-disruption-budgets-and-pod-disruption-budgets-for-nap) to control how and when disruption occurs during upgrades.

Note

NAP forces the latest image version to be picked up if the existing node image version is older than 90 days. This bypasses any existing maintenance window.

## Node OS upgrade maintenance windows for NAP

You can use the [AKS planned maintenance feature](planned-maintenance) with a [node OS auto-upgrade channel](auto-upgrade-node-os-image) to configure a `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

maintenance window that controls when to perform node OS security patching scheduled by your designated node OS auto-upgrade channel.

### Node OS upgrade maintenance window behavior and considerations

Keep the following information in mind when configuring a node OS upgrade maintenance window for NAP:

- The
`aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

maintenance configuration determines the window during which NAP picks up a new image. This configuration doesn't necessarily determine when existing nodes are disrupted. - The upgrade mechanism and decision criteria are specific to NAP/Karpenter and are evaluated by NAP's drift logic. NAP respects Karpenter Node Disruption Budgets and Pod Disruption Budgets. For more information about drift, see the
[Karpenter drift documentation](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/disruption/#drift). - These NAP upgrade decisions are separate from the cluster
`NodeImage`

and`SecurityPatch`

channels. However, the`aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

maintenance configuration applies them as well. - We recommend using a maintenance window of four hours or more for reliable operation.
- If no maintenance configuration exists, AKS might use a fallback schedule to pick up new images, which can cause images to be picked up at unexpected times. You can avoid unexpected timing of new images and upgrades by defining an explicit
`aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

. - Allow at least 30 minutes between creating or updating a maintenance configuration and the scheduled start time to ensure AKS has time to reconcile the new configuration.

### Recommended schedule pattern for NAP-managed nodes

We recommend the following schedule pattern for NAP-managed nodes:

**Weekly cadence**: Recommended for routine node image roll outs (for example:*Every week on Sunday*).

## Create a node OS maintenance schedule example

The following sections show you how to create a weekly maintenance window for NAP-managed nodes using the Azure CLI and a JSON configuration file and how to update, view, list, and delete the maintenance configuration.

### Create a maintenance configuration

Create a JSON file named

`nodeosMaintenance.json`

with a weekly maintenance window (for example:*Sunday at 01:00 UTC for 4 hours*).`{ "properties": { "maintenanceWindow": { "durationHours": 4, "schedule": { "weekly": { "intervalWeeks": 1, "dayOfWeek": "Sunday" } }, "startDate": "2025-01-01", "startTime": "01:00", "utcOffset": "+00:00" } } }`

Add the maintenance configuration to your cluster using the

command.`az aks maintenanceconfiguration add`

`az aks maintenanceconfiguration add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule \ --config-file ./nodeosMaintenance.json`


### Update, view, list, or delete a maintenance configuration

You can use the following commands to update, view, list, or delete a maintenance configuration for NAP-managed nodes:

Update a maintenance configuration by modifying the JSON file and then running the

command.`az aks maintenanceconfiguration update`

`az aks maintenanceconfiguration update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule \ --config-file ./nodeosMaintenance.json`

View the details of a maintenance configuration using the

command.`az aks maintenanceconfiguration show`

`az aks maintenanceconfiguration show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

List all maintenance configurations for your cluster using the

command.`az aks maintenanceconfiguration list`

`az aks maintenanceconfiguration list \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

Delete a maintenance configuration using the

command.`az aks maintenanceconfiguration delete`

`az aks maintenanceconfiguration delete \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`
