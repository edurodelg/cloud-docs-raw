Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you provide network connectivity for your nodes and applications. These network resources include IP address ranges, load balancers, and ingress controllers.

This best practices article focuses on network connectivity and security for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Explain Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) network mode in AKS.
- Plan for required IP addressing and connectivity.
- Distribute traffic using load balancers, ingress controllers, or a web application firewall (WAF).
- Securely connect to cluster nodes.

## Choose the appropriate network model


Best practice guidanceUse Azure CNI networking in AKS for integration with existing virtual networks or on-premises networks. This network model allows greater separation of resources and controls in an enterprise environment.


Virtual networks provide the basic connectivity for AKS nodes and customers to access your applications. There are two different ways to deploy AKS clusters into virtual networks:

**Azure CNI networking**: Deploys into a virtual network and uses the[Azure CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md)Kubernetes plugin. Pods receive individual IPs that can route to other network services or on-premises resources.

Azure CNI is a valid option for production deployments.

### CNI Networking

Azure CNI is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. It assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network. There's no need for extra routing to communicate with other resources or services.

Notably, Azure CNI networking for production allows for separation of control and management of resources. From a security perspective, you often want different teams to manage and secure those resources. With Azure CNI networking, you connect to existing Azure resources, on-premises resources, or other services directly via IP addresses assigned to each pod.

When you use Azure CNI networking, the virtual network resource is in a separate resource group to the AKS cluster. Delegate permissions for the AKS cluster identity to access and manage these resources. The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network.

If you wish to define a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


By default, AKS uses a managed identity for its cluster identity. However, you can use a service principal instead.

- For more information about AKS service principal delegation, see
[Delegate access to other Azure resources](kubernetes-service-principal#delegate-access-to-other-azure-resources). - For more information about managed identities, see
[Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

As each node and pod receives its own IP address, plan out the address ranges for the AKS subnets. Keep the following criteria in mind:

- The subnet must be large enough to provide IP addresses for every node, pod, and network resource you deploy.
- With Azure CNI networking, each running node has default limits to the number of pods.

- Avoid using IP address ranges that overlap with existing network resources.
- It's necessary to allow connectivity to on-premises or peered networks in Azure.

- To handle scale-out events or cluster upgrades, you need extra IP addresses available in the assigned subnet.
- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see
[Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see

To calculate the IP address required, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

When creating a cluster with Azure CNI networking, you specify other address ranges for the cluster, such as the Docker bridge address, DNS service IP, and service address range. In general, make sure these address ranges don't overlap each other or any networks associated with the cluster, including any virtual networks, subnets, on-premises and peered networks.

For the specific details around limits and sizing for these address ranges, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

## Distribute ingress traffic


Best practice guidanceTo distribute HTTP or HTTPS traffic to your applications, use ingress resources and controllers. Compared to an Azure load balancer, ingress controllers provide extra features and can be managed as native Kubernetes resources.


While an Azure load balancer can distribute customer traffic to applications in your AKS cluster, it's limited in understanding that traffic. A load balancer resource works at *layer 4* and distributes traffic based on protocol or ports.

Most web applications using HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at *layer 7*. Ingress can distribute traffic based on the URL of the application and handle TLS/SSL termination. Ingress also reduces the number of IP addresses you expose and map.

With a load balancer, each application typically needs a public IP address assigned and mapped to the service in the AKS cluster. With an ingress resource, a single IP address can distribute traffic to multiple applications.

There are two components for ingress:

- An ingress
*resource* - An ingress
*controller*

### Ingress resource

The *ingress resource* is a YAML manifest of `kind: Ingress`

. It defines the host, certificates, and rules to route traffic to services running in your AKS cluster.

The following example YAML manifest distributes traffic for *myapp.com* to one of two services, *blogservice* or *storeservice*, and directs the customer to one service or the other based on the URL they access.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: myapp-ingress
spec:
ingressClassName: PublicIngress
tls:
- hosts:
- myapp.com
secretName: myapp-secret
rules:
- host: myapp.com
http:
paths:
- path: /blog
backend:
service:
name: blogservice
port: 80
- path: /store
backend:
service:
name: storeservice
port: 80
```


### Ingress controller

An *ingress controller* is a daemon that runs on an AKS node and watches for incoming requests. Traffic is then distributed based on the rules defined in the ingress resource. While the most common ingress controller is based on [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/kubernetes-ingress-controller), AKS doesn't restrict you to a specific controller. You can use [Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview), [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour), [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org), [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik), etc.

Ingress controllers must be scheduled on a Linux node. Indicate that the resource should run on a Linux-based node using a node selector in your YAML manifest or Helm chart deployment. For more information, see [Use node selectors to control where pods are scheduled in AKS](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-selectors).

## Ingress with the application routing addon

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed, ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing add-on, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Secure traffic with a web application firewall (WAF)


Best practice guidanceTo scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as

[Barracuda WAF for Azure]or[Azure Application Gateway for Containers]. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic TLS termination.

Typically, an ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource in your AKS cluster that distributes traffic to services and applications. The controller runs as a daemon on an AKS node, and consumes some of the node's resources, like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In larger environments, you may want to consider the following:

- Offload some of this traffic routing or TLS termination to a network resource outside of the AKS cluster.
- Scan incoming traffic for potential attacks.

For that extra layer of security, a web application firewall (WAF) filters the incoming traffic. With a set of rules, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) watches for attacks like cross-site scripting or cookie poisoning. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) is a WAF that integrates with AKS clusters, locking in these security features before the traffic reaches your AKS cluster and applications.

Since other third-party solutions also perform these functions, you can continue to use existing investments or expertise in your preferred product.

Load balancer or ingress resources continually run in your AKS cluster and refine the traffic distribution. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) can be centrally managed as an ingress controller with a resource definition. To get started, [create an Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller).

## Control traffic flow with network policies


Best practice guidanceUse network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication.


Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. Network policies are a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

To use [network policies in AKS](use-network-policies), the feature can be enabled either during cluster creation or on an existing AKS cluster. If you are planning to use network policies, ensure the feature is enabled on your AKS cluster.

Note

Network policies could be used for Linux-based or Windows-based nodes and pods in AKS.

You create a network policy as a Kubernetes resource using a YAML manifest. Policies are applied to defined pods, with ingress or egress rules defining traffic flow.

The following example applies a network policy to pods with the *app: backend* label applied to them. The ingress rule only allows traffic from pods with the *app: frontend* label.

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: backend-policy
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ingress:
- from:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
```


To get started with policies, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-network-policies).

## Securely connect to nodes through a bastion host


Best practice guidanceDon't expose remote connectivity to your AKS nodes. Create a bastion host, or jump box, in a management virtual network. Use the bastion host to securely route traffic into your AKS cluster to remote management tasks.


You can complete most operations in AKS using the Azure management tools or through the Kubernetes API server. AKS nodes are only available on a private network and aren't connected to the public internet. To connect to nodes and provide maintenance and support, route your connections through a bastion host, or jump box. Verify this host lives in a separate, securely peered management virtual network to the AKS cluster virtual network.

You should also secure the management network for the bastion host. Use an [Azure ExpressRoute](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN gateway](/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) to connect to an on-premises network and control access using network security groups.

# Use multiple load balancers in Azure Kubernetes Service (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) normally provisions one Standard Load Balancer (SLB) for all `LoadBalancer`

Services in a cluster. Because each node NIC is limited to [ 300 inbound load‑balancing rules and 8 private‑link services](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#load-balancer), large clusters or port‑heavy workloads can quickly exhaust these limits.

The **multiple SLB preview** removes that bottleneck by letting you create several SLBs inside the same cluster and shard nodes and Services across them. You define *load‑balancer configurations*, each tied to a primary agent pool and optional namespace, label, or node selectors—and AKS automatically places nodes and Services on the appropriate SLB. Outbound SNAT behavior is unchanged if `outboundType`

is `loadBalancer`

. Outbound traffic still flows through the first SLB.

Use this feature to:

- Scale beyond 300 inbound rules without adding clusters.
- Isolate tenant or workload traffic by binding a dedicated SLB to its own agent pool.
- Distribute private‑link services across multiple SLBs when you approach the per‑SLB limit.

## Prerequisites

`aks-preview`

extension 18.0.0b1 or later.- Subscription feature flag
`Microsoft.ContainerService/MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

registered. - Kubernetes version 1.28 or later.
- Cluster created with
`--load-balancer-backend-pool-type nodeIP`

or update and existing cluster using`az aks update`

.

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install the aks-preview extension using the

command.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension released using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "MultipleStandardLoadBalancersPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## How AKS chooses a load balancer (node & Service placement)

AKS uses multiple inputs to determine where to place nodes and expose LoadBalancer Services. These inputs are defined in each load balancer configuration and influence which SLB is selected for each resource.

| Input type | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
Primary agent pool`--primary-agent-pool-name` |
Nodes | Required. All nodes in this pool are always added to the SLB’s backend pool. Ensures each SLB has at least one healthy node. |
Node selector`--node-selector` |
Nodes | Optional. Adds any node with matching labels to the SLB, in addition to the primary pool. |
Service namespace selector`--service-namespace-selector` |
Services | Optional. Only Services in namespaces with matching labels are considered for this SLB. |
Service label selector`--service-label-selector` |
Services | Optional. Only Services with matching labels are eligible for this SLB. |
Service annotation`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-configurations` |
Services | Optional. Limits placement to one or more explicitly named SLB configurations. Without it, any matching configuration is eligible. |

Note

Selectors define eligibility. The annotation (if used) restricts the controller to a specific subset of SLBs.

### How AKS uses these inputs

The AKS control plane continuously reconciles node and Service state using the rules above:

#### Node placement

When a node is added or updated, AKS checks which SLBs it qualifies for based on primary pool and node selector.

- If multiple SLBs match, the controller picks the one with the fewest current nodes.
- The node is added to that SLB’s backend pool.

#### Service placement

When a LoadBalancer Service is created or updated:

- AKS finds SLBs whose namespace and label selectors match the Service.
- If the Service annotation is present, only those named SLBs are considered.
- SLBs that have allowServicePlacement=false or that would exceed Azure limits (300 rules or 8 private-link services) are excluded.
- Among valid options, the SLB with the fewest rules is chosen.

### externalTrafficPolicy (ETP) behavior

AKS handles Services differently depending on the value of `externalTrafficPolicy`

.

| Mode | How load balancer selection works | How backend pool membership is built | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
Cluster (default) |
The controller follows the standard placement rules described above. A single load-balancing rule targets the shared kubernetes backend pool on the chosen SLB. |
All nodes in that SLB’s `kubernetes` pool are healthy targets. Nodes without matching Pods are removed automatically by health probes. |
Same behavior as today in single-SLB clusters. |
Local |
The controller still uses the selector-based algorithm to pick an SLB, but creates a dedicated backend pool per Service instead of using the shared pool. |
Membership is synced from the Service’s `EndpointSlice` objects, so only nodes that actually host ready Pods are added. Health probes continue to use `healthCheckNodePort` to drop unhealthy nodes. |
Guarantees client IP preservation and avoids routing through nodes that lack Pods, even when nodes are sharded across multiple SLBs. |


Why a dedicated pool for ETP Local?

In multi-SLB mode, nodes that host Pods for a given Service may reside on different SLBs from the client-facing VIP. A shared backend pool would often contain zero eligible nodes, breaking traffic. By allocating a per-Service pool and syncing it from`EndpointSlice`

, AKS ensures the Service’s SLB always points at the correct nodes.

**Impact on quotas**

- Each ETP Local Service adds one backend pool and one load-balancing rule to its SLB.
- These count toward the 300-rule limit, so monitor rule usage when you have many ETP Local Services.

**No change to outbound traffic**

Outbound SNAT still flows through the first SLB’s `aksOutboundBackendPool`

when `outboundType`

is `loadBalancer`

, independent of ETP settings.

#### Optional: Rebalancing

You can manually rebalance node distribution later using `az aks loadbalancer rebalance`

.

This design lets you define flexible, label-driven routing for both infrastructure and workloads, while AKS handles placement automatically to maintain balance and avoid quota issues.

## Add the first load balancer configuration

Add a configuration named `kubernetes`

and bind it to a *primary* agent pool that always has at least one node. Removing every configuration switches the cluster back to single‑SLB mode.

Important

To enable multiple‑SLB mode you **must** add a load‑balancer configuration named `kubernetes`

and attach it to a *primary* agent pool that always has at least one ready node.

The presence of this configuration toggles multi‑SLB support; in service selection, it has no special priority and is treated like any other load balancer configuration.

If you delete every load‑balancer configuration, the cluster automatically falls back to single‑SLB mode, which can briefly disrupt service routing or SNAT flows.

Set environment variables for use throughout this tutorial. You can replace all placeholder values with your own except

`DEFAULT_LB_NAME`

, which must remain as`kubernetes`

.`RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-aks-multislb" CLUSTER_NAME="aks-multi-slb" LOCATION="westus" DEFAULT_LB_NAME="kubernetes" PRIMARY_POOL="nodepool1"`

Create resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.\`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --load-balancer-backend-pool-type nodeIP \ --node-count 3`

Add a default load balancer using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer add`

`az aks loadbalancer add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $DEFAULT_LB_NAME \ --primary-agent-pool-name $PRIMARY_POOL \ --allow-service-placement true`


## Add additional load balancers

Create tenant‑specific configurations by specifying a different primary pool plus optional namespace, label, or node selectors.

Team 1 will run its own workloads in a separate node pool. Assign a

`tenant=team1`

label so workloads can be scheduled using selectors:`TEAM1_POOL="team1pool" TEAM1_LB_NAME="team1-lb"`

Create a second node pool for team 1 using the

command.`az aks nodepool add`

`az aks nodepool add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $TEAM1_POOL \ --labels tenant=team1 \ --node-count 2`

Create a load balancer for team 1 using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer add`

`az aks loadbalancer add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $TEAM1_LB_NAME \ --primary-agent-pool-name $TEAM1_POOL \ --service-namespace-selector "tenant=team1" \ --node-selector "tenant=team1"`

Label the target namespace (e.g.,

`team1-apps`

) to match the selector using thecommand.`az aks command invoke`

`az aks command invoke \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --command " kubectl create namespace team1-apps --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f - kubectl label namespace team1-apps tenant=team1 --overwrite "`

You can now list the load balancers in the cluster to see the multiple configurations using the

command.`az aks loadbalancer list`

`az aks loadbalancer list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --output table`

Example output:

`AllowServicePlacement ETag Name PrimaryAgentPoolName ProvisioningState ResourceGroup ----------------------- ------- ---------- ---------------------- ------------------- --------------- True <ETAG> kubernetes nodepool1 Succeeded rg-aks-multislb True <ETAG> team1-lb team1pool Succeeded rg-aks-multislb`


### Deploy a Service to a specific load balancer

Add the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-configurations`

with a comma‑separated list of configuration names. If the annotation is omitted, the controller chooses automatically.

```
az aks command invoke \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--command "
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: lb-svc-1

"
```


### Rebalance nodes (optional)

Run a rebalance operation after scaling if rule counts become unbalanced using the [ az aks loadbalancer rebalance](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/loadbalancer#az-aks-loadbalancer-rebalance) command. This command disrupts active flows, so schedule it during a maintenance window.

```
az aks loadbalancer rebalance --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME
```


## Monitoring and troubleshooting

- Watch controller events (
`kubectl get events …`

) to confirm that Services are reconciled. - If external connectivity is blocked, open a node shell and curl the Service VIP to confirm kube‑proxy routing.

## Limitations and known issues

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| Outbound SNAT | Always uses the first SLB; outbound flows aren’t sharded. |
| Backend pool type | Create or update and existing cluster to use `nodeIP` backend pools. |
| Autoscaler zeros | A primary agent pool can’t scale to 0 nodes. |
ETP `local` Rule Growth |
Each ETP `local` Service uses its own rule and backend pool, so rule counts can grow faster than with `cluster` mode. |
| Rebalance disruption | Removing a node from a backend pool drops in‑flight connections. Plan maintenance windows. |
| Configuration reload timing | After running `az aks loadbalancer` , changes may not take effect immediately. The AKS operation finishes quickly, but the cloud-controller-manager may take longer to apply updates. Wait for the `EnsuredLoadBalancer` event to confirm the changes are active. |

## Clean up resources

Delete the resource group when you’re finished to remove the cluster and load balancers using the [ az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command.

```
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes --no-wait
```


## Next steps

The multiple SLB feature helps scale and isolate workloads at the networking layer while maintaining simplicity through Azure-managed configuration. For more information, see the following resources:
