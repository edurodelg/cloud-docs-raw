Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which is based on the open source [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) version.

When configured, the VPA automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage. The VPA frees up CPU and Memory for other pods and helps ensure effective utilization of your AKS clusters. The Vertical Pod Autoscaler provides recommendations for resource usage over time. To manage sudden increases in resource usage, use the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler), which scales the number of pod replicas as needed.

## Benefits

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler offers the following benefits:

- Analyzes and adjusts processor and memory resources to
*right size*your applications. VPA isn't only responsible for scaling up, but also for scaling down based on their resource use over time. - A pod with a scaling mode set to
*auto*or*recreate*is evicted if it needs to change its resource requests. - You can set CPU and memory constraints for individual containers by specifying a resource policy.
- Ensures nodes have correct resources for pod scheduling.
- Offers configurable logging of any adjustments made to processor or memory resources made.
- Improves cluster resource utilization and frees up CPU and memory for other pods.

## Limitations and considerations

Consider the following limitations and considerations when using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler:

- VPA supports a maximum of 1,000 pods associated with
`VerticalPodAutoscaler`

objects per cluster. - VPA might recommend more resources than available in the cluster, which prevents the pod from being assigned to a node and run due to insufficient resources. You can overcome this limitation by setting the
*LimitRange*to the maximum available resources per namespace, which ensures pods don't ask for more resources than specified. You can also set maximum allowed resource recommendations per pod in a`VerticalPodAutoscaler`

object. The VPA can't completely overcome an insufficient node resource issue. The limit range is fixed, but the node resource usage is changed dynamically. - We don't recommend using VPA with the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler), which scales based on the same CPU and memory usage metrics. - The VPA Recommender only stores up to
*eight days*of historical data. - VPA doesn't support JVM-based workloads due to limited visibility into actual memory usage of the workload.
- VPA doesn't support running your own implementation of VPA alongside it. Having an extra or customized recommender is supported.
- AKS Windows containers aren't supported.

## VPA overview

The VPA object consists of three components:

**Recommender**: The Recommender monitors current and past resource consumption, including metric history, Out of Memory (OOM) events, and VPA deployment specs, and uses the information it gathers to provide recommended values for container CPU and Memory requests/limits.**Updater**: The Updater monitors managed pods to ensure that their resource requests are set correctly. If not, it removes those pods so that their controllers can recreate them with the updated requests.**VPA Admission Controller**: The VPA Admission Controller sets the correct resource requests on new pods either created or recreated by their controller based on the Updater's activity.

### VPA admission controller

The VPA Admission Controller is a binary that registers itself as a *Mutating Admission Webhook*. When a new pod is created, the VPA Admission Controller gets a request from the API server and evaluates if there's a matching VPA configuration or finds a corresponding one and uses the current recommendation to set resource requests in the pod.

A standalone job, `overlay-vpa-cert-webhook-check`

, runs outside of the VPA Admission Controller. The `overlay-vpa-cert-webhook-check`

job creates and renews the certificates and registers the VPA Admission Controller as a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`

.

### VPA object operation modes

A Vertical Pod Autoscaler resource, most commonly a *deployment*, is inserted for each controller that you want to have automatically computed resource requirements.

There are four modes in which the VPA operates:

`Auto`

: VPA assigns resource requests during pod creation and updates existing pods using the preferred update mechanism.`Auto`

, which is equivalent to`Recreate`

, is the default mode. Once restart-free, or*in-place*, updates of pod requests are available, it can be used as the preferred update mechanism by the`Auto`

mode. With the`Auto`

mode, VPA evicts a pod if it needs to change its resource requests. It might cause the pods to be restarted all at once, which can cause application inconsistencies. You can limit restarts and maintain consistency in this situation using a[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/).`Recreate`

: VPA assigns resource requests during pod creation and updates existing pods by evicting them when the requested resources differ significantly from the new recommendations (respecting the PodDisruptionBudget, if defined). You should only use this mode if you need to ensure that the pods are restarted whenever the resource request changes. Otherwise, we recommend using`Auto`

mode, which takes advantage of restart-free updates once available.`Initial`

: VPA only assigns resource requests during pod creation. It doesn't update existing pods. This mode is useful for testing and understanding the VPA behavior without affecting the running pods.`Off`

: VPA doesn't automatically change the resource requirements of the pods. The recommendations are calculated and can be inspected in the VPA object.

## Deployment pattern for application development

If you're unfamiliar with VPA, we recommend the following deployment pattern during application development to identify its unique resource utilization characteristics, test VPA to verify it's functioning properly, and test alongside other Kubernetes components to optimize resource utilization of the cluster:

- Set
`UpdateMode = "Off"`

in your production cluster and run VPA in recommendation mode so you can test and gain familiarity with VPA.`UpdateMode = "Off"`

can avoid introducing a misconfiguration that can cause an outage. - Establish observability first by collecting actual resource utilization telemetry over a given period of time, which helps you understand the behavior and any signs of issues from container and pod resources influenced by the workloads running on them.
- Get familiar with the monitoring data to understand the performance characteristics. Based on this insight, set the desired requests/limits accordingly and then in the next deployment or upgrade.
- Set
`updateMode`

value to`Auto`

,`Recreate`

, or`Initial`

depending on your requirements.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to install the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The OSM add-on installs the OSM mesh on your cluster. The OSM mesh is a service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection for your applications. For more information about the OSM mesh, see [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/).

Warning

Microsoft has announced the retirement of the [Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). The upstream OSM project has also been retired by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/). Identify any existing OSM configurations and migrate them to equivalent Istio configurations. For migration steps, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

Important

Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.

| Kubernetes version | OSM version installed |
|---|---|
| 1.24.0 or greater | 1.2.5 |
| Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3 |
| Below 1.23.5 | 1.0.0 |

Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install the OSM add-on on your cluster

If you don't have one already, create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create a new AKS cluster with the OSM add-on installed using the

command and specify`az aks create`

`open-service-mesh`

for the`--enable-addons`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-addons open-service-mesh \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Important

You can't enable the OSM add-on on an existing cluster if an OSM mesh is already on your cluster. Uninstall any existing OSM meshes on your cluster before enabling the OSM add-on.

When installing on an existing clusters, use the [ az aks enable-addons](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-enable-addons) command. The following code shows an example:

```
az aks enable-addons \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myAKSCluster \
--addons open-service-mesh
```


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


## Verify the OSM add-on is installed on your cluster

Verify the OSM add-on is installed on your cluster using the

command with and specify`az aks show`

`'addonProfiles.openServiceMesh.enabled'`

for the`--query`

parameter. In the output, under`addonProfiles`

, the`enabled`

value should show as`true`

for`openServiceMesh`

.`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query 'addonProfiles.openServiceMesh.enabled'`


## Verify the OSM mesh is running on your cluster

Verify the version, status, and configuration of the OSM mesh running on your cluster using the

`kubectl get deployment`

command and display the image version of the*osm-controller*deployment.`kubectl get deployment -n kube-system osm-controller -o=jsonpath='{$.spec.template.spec.containers[:1].image}'`

The following example output shows version

*0.11.1*of the OSM mesh:`mcr.microsoft.com/oss/openservicemesh/osm-controller:v0.11.1`

Verify the status of the OSM components running on your cluster using the following

`kubectl`

commands to show the status of the`app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io`

deployments, pods, and services.`kubectl get deployments -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io kubectl get pods -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io kubectl get services -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io`

Important

If any pods have a status other than

`Running`

, such as`Pending`

, your cluster might not have enough resources to run OSM. Review the sizing for your cluster, such as the number of nodes and the virtual machine's SKU, before continuing to use OSM on your cluster.Verify the configuration of your OSM mesh using the

`kubectl get meshconfig`

command.`kubectl get meshconfig osm-mesh-config -n kube-system -o yaml`

The following example output shows the configuration of an OSM mesh:

`apiVersion: config.openservicemesh.io/v1alpha1 kind: MeshConfig metadata: creationTimestamp: "0000-00-00A00:00:00A" generation: 1 name: osm-mesh-config namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "2494" uid: 6c4d67f3-c241-4aeb-bf4f-b029b08faa31 spec: certificate: serviceCertValidityDuration: 24h featureFlags: enableEgressPolicy: true enableMulticlusterMode: false enableWASMStats: true observability: enableDebugServer: true osmLogLevel: info tracing: address: jaeger.osm-system.svc.cluster.local enable: false endpoint: /api/v2/spans port: 9411 sidecar: configResyncInterval: 0s enablePrivilegedInitContainer: false envoyImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/envoyproxy/envoy:v1.18.3 initContainerImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/openservicemesh/init:v0.9.1 logLevel: error maxDataPlaneConnections: 0 resources: {} traffic: enableEgress: true enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode: true inboundExternalAuthorization: enable: false failureModeAllow: false statPrefix: inboundExtAuthz timeout: 1s useHTTPSIngress: false`

The example output shows

`enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode: true`

, which means OSM has permissive traffic policy mode enabled. With this mode enabled in your OSM mesh:- The
[SMI](https://smi-spec.io/)traffic policy enforcement is bypassed. - OSM automatically discovers services that are a part of the service mesh.
- OSM creates traffic policy rules on each Envoy proxy sidecar to be able to communicate with these services.

- The

## Delete your cluster

When you no longer need the cluster, you can delete it using the

command, which removes the resource group, the cluster, and all related resources.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait`


Note

Alternatively, you can uninstall the OSM add-on and the related resources from your cluster. For more information, see [Uninstall the Open Service Mesh add-on from your AKS cluster](open-service-mesh-uninstall-add-on).

## Next steps

This article showed you how to install the OSM add-on on an AKS cluster and verify it's installed and running. With the OSM add-on installed on your cluster, you can [deploy a sample application](https://release-v1-0.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) or [onboard an existing application](https://release-v1-0.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/) to work with your OSM mesh.
