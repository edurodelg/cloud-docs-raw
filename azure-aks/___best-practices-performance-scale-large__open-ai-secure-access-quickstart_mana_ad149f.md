Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Note

This article focuses on general best practices for **large workloads**. For best practices specific to **small to medium workloads**, see [Performance and scaling best practices for small to medium workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](best-practices-performance-scale).

As you deploy and maintain clusters in AKS, you can use the following best practices to help you optimize performance and scaling.

Keep in mind that *large* is a relative term. Kubernetes has a multi-dimensional scale envelope, and the scale envelope for your workload depends on the resources you use. For example, a cluster with 100 nodes and thousands of pods or CRDs might be considered large. A 1,000 node cluster with 1,000 pods and various other resources might be considered small from the control plane perspective. The best signal for scale of a Kubernetes control plane is API server HTTP request success rate and latency, as that's a proxy for the amount of load on the control plane.

In this article, you learn about:

- AKS and Kubernetes control plane scalability.
- Kubernetes Client best practices, including backoff, watches, and pagination.
- Azure API and platform throttling limits.
- Feature limitations.
- Networking and node pool scaling best practices.

## AKS and Kubernetes control plane scalability

In AKS, a *cluster* consists of a set of nodes (physical or virtual machines (VMs)) that run Kubernetes agents and are managed by the Kubernetes control plane hosted by AKS. While AKS optimizes the Kubernetes control plane and its components for scalability and performance, it's still bound by the upstream project limits.

Kubernetes has a multi-dimensional scale envelope with each resource type representing a dimension. Not all resources are alike. For example, *watches* are commonly set on secrets, which result in list calls to the kube-apiserver that add cost and a disproportionately higher load on the control plane compared to resources without watches.

The control plane manages all the resource scaling in the cluster, so the more you scale the cluster within a given dimension, the less you can scale within other dimensions. For example, running hundreds of thousands of pods in an AKS cluster impacts how much pod churn rate (pod mutations per second) the control plane can support.

The size of the envelope is proportional to the size of the Kubernetes control plane. AKS supports three control plane tiers as part of the Base SKU: Free, Standard, and Premium tier. For more information, see [Free, Standard, and Premium pricing tiers for AKS cluster management](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

Important

We highly recommend using the Standard or Premium tier for production or at-scale workloads. AKS automatically scales up the Kubernetes control plane to support the following scale limits:

- Up to 5,000 nodes per AKS cluster
- 200,000 pods per AKS cluster (with Azure CNI Overlay)

In most cases, crossing the scale limit threshold results in degraded performance, but doesn't cause the cluster to immediately fail over. To manage load on the Kubernetes control plane, consider scaling in batches of up to 10-20% of the current scale. For example, for a 5,000 node cluster, scale in increments of 500-1,000 nodes. While AKS does autoscale your control plane, it doesn't happen instantaneously.

You can leverage API Priority and Fairness (APF) to throttle specific clients and request types to protect the control plane during high churn and load.

## Kubernetes clients

Kubernetes clients are the applications clients, such as operators or monitoring agents, deployed in the Kubernetes cluster that need to communicate with the kube-api server to perform read or mutate operations. It's important to optimize the behavior of these clients to minimize the load they add to the kube-api server and Kubernetes control plane.

You can analyze API server traffic and client behavior through Kube Audit logs. For more information, see [Troubleshoot the Kubernetes control plane](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/troubleshoot-apiserver-etcd).

LIST requests can be expensive. When working with lists that might have more than a few thousand small objects or more than a few hundred large objects, you should consider the following guidelines:

**Consider the number of objects (CRs) you expect to eventually exist**when defining a new resource type (CRD).**The load on etcd and API server primarily relies on the size of the response**. Even if you use a field selector to filter the list and retrieve only a small number of results, these guidelines still apply. The only exception is retrieval of a single object by`metadata.name`

.**Avoid repeated LIST calls if possible**if your code needs to maintain an updated list of objects in memory. Instead, consider using the Informer classes provided in most Kubernetes libraries. Informers automatically combine LIST and WATCH functionalities to efficiently maintain an in-memory collection.**Consider whether you need strong consistency**if Informers don't meet your needs. Do you need to see the most recent data, up to the exact moment in time you issued the query? If not, set`ResourceVersion=0`

. This causes the API server cache to serve your request instead of etcd.**If you can't use Informers or the API server cache, read large lists in chunks**.**Avoid listing more often than needed**. If you can't use Informers, consider how often your application lists the resources. After you read the last object in a large list, don't immediately re-query the same list. You should wait a while instead.**Add approporiate exponential backoffs and retry policies**to prevent clients from overwhelming the API server.**Consider the number of running instances of your client application**. There's a big difference between having a single controller listing objects vs. having pods on each node doing the same thing. If you plan to have multiple instances of your client application periodically listing large numbers of objects, your solution won't scale to large clusters.**Keep the overall Etcd size small**and do not use Etcd as a regular database. Some object size reduction techniques are listed below- To reduce pod specification sizes, move environment variables from pod specifications to ConfigMaps
- Split large secrets or ConfigMaps into smaller, more manageable pieces
- Review and optimize resource specifications in your applications
- Reduce revision count


## Azure API and Platform throttling

The load on a cloud application can vary over time based on factors such as the number of active users or the types of actions that users perform. If the processing requirements of the system exceed the capacity of the available resources, the system can become overloaded and suffer from poor performance and failures.

To handle varying load sizes in a cloud application, you can allow the application to use resources up to a specified limit and then throttle them when the limit is reached. On Azure, throttling happens at two levels. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) throttles requests for the subscription and tenant. If the request is under the throttling limits for the subscription and tenant, ARM routes the request to the resource provider. The resource provider then applies throttling limits tailored to its operations. For more information, see [ARM throttling requests](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling).

### Manage throttling in AKS

Azure API limits are usually defined at a subscription-region combination level. For example, all clients within a subscription in a given region share API limits for a given Azure API, such as Virtual Machine Scale Sets PUT APIs. Every AKS cluster has several AKS-owned clients, such as cloud provider or cluster autoscaler, or customer-owned clients, such as Datadog or self-hosted Prometheus, that call Azure APIs. When running multiple AKS clusters in a subscription within a given region, all the AKS-owned and customer-owned clients within the clusters share a common set of API limits. Therefore, the number of clusters you can deploy in a subscription region is a function of the number of clients deployed, their call patterns, and the overall scale and elasticity of the clusters.

Keeping the above considerations in mind, customers are typically able to deploy between 20-40 small to medium scale clusters per subscription-region. You can maximize your subscription scale using the following best practices:

Always upgrade your Kubernetes clusters to the latest version. Newer versions contain many improvements that address performance and throttling issues. If you're using an upgraded version of Kubernetes and still see throttling due to the actual load or the number of clients in the subscription, you can try the following options:

**Analyze errors using AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems**: You can use[AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems](aks-diagnostics)to analyze errors, identity the root cause, and get resolution recommendations.**Increase the Cluster Autoscaler scan interval**: If the diagnostic reports show that[Cluster Autoscaler throttling has been detected](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/429-too-many-requests-errors#analyze-and-identify-errors-by-using-aks-diagnose-and-solve-problems), you can[increase the scan interval](cluster-autoscaler#update-the-cluster-autoscaler-settings)to reduce the number of calls to Virtual Machine Scale Sets from the Cluster Autoscaler.**Reconfigure third-party applications to make fewer calls**: If you filter by*user agents*in thediagnostic and see that**View request rate and throttle details**[a third-party application, such as a monitoring application, makes a large number of GET requests](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/429-too-many-requests-errors#analyze-and-identify-errors-by-using-aks-diagnose-and-solve-problems), you can change the settings of these applications to reduce the frequency of the GET calls. Make sure the application clients use exponential backoff when calling Azure APIs.

**Split your clusters into different subscriptions or regions**: If you have a large number of clusters and node pools that use Virtual Machine Scale Sets, you can split them into different subscriptions or regions within the same subscription. Most Azure API limits are shared at the subscription-region level, so you can move or scale your clusters to different subscriptions or regions to get unblocked on Azure API throttling. This option is especially helpful if you expect your clusters to have high activity. There are no generic guidelines for these limits. If you want specific guidance, you can create a support ticket.

## Monitor AKS Control Plane metrics and logs

Monitoring control plane metrics in large AKS clusters is crucial for ensuring the stability and performance of Kubernetes workloads. These metrics provide visibility into the health and behavior of critical components like the API server, etcd, controller manager, and scheduler. In large-scale environments, where resource contention and high API call volumes are common, monitoring control plane metrics helps identify bottlenecks, detect anomalies, and optimize resource usage. By analyzing these metrics, operators can proactively address issues such as API server latency, high etcd objects, or excessive control plane resource consumption, ensuring efficient cluster operation and minimizing downtime.

Azure Monitor offers comprehensive metrics and logs on the health of the control plane through [Azure Managed Prometheus](monitor-control-plane-metrics#monitor-aks-control-plane-metrics-preview) and [Diagnostic settings](monitor-control-plane-metrics#azure-monitor-resource-logs)

- For list of alerts to configure for health of the control plane, please checkout
[Best practices for AKS control plane monitoring](best-practices-monitoring-proactive#kubernetes-control-plane-alerts) - To get the list of user agents having the highest latency, you can use the Control Plane logs/Diagnostic Settings

## Feature limitations

As you scale your AKS clusters to larger scale points, keep the following feature limitations in mind:

- AKS supports scaling up to 5,000 nodes by default for all Standard Tier / LTS clusters. AKS scales your cluster's control plane at runtime based on cluster size and API server resource utilization. If you can't scale up to the supported limit, enable
[control plane metrics (Preview)](monitor-control-plane-metrics)with the[Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)to monitor the control plane. To help troubleshoot scaling performance or reliability issues, see the following resources:

Note

During the operation to scale the control plane, you might encounter elevated API server latency or timeouts for up to 15 minutes. If you continue to have problems scaling to the supported limit, open a [support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Support/Parameters/%7B%0D%0A%09%22subId%22%3A+%22%22%2C%0D%0A%09%22pesId%22%3A+%225a3a423f-8667-9095-1770-0a554a934512%22%2C%0D%0A%09%22supportTopicId%22%3A+%2280ea0df7-5108-8e37-2b0e-9737517f0b96%22%2C%0D%0A%09%22contextInfo%22%3A+%22AksLabelDeprecationMarch22%22%2C%0D%0A%09%22caller%22%3A+%22Microsoft_Azure_ContainerService+%2B+AksLabelDeprecationMarch22%22%2C%0D%0A%09%22severity%22%3A+%223%22%0D%0A%7D).

[Azure Network Policy Manager (Azure npm)](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/kubernetes-network-policies)only supports up to 250 nodes.- Some AKS node metrics, including node disk usage, node CPU/memory usage, and network in/out, won't be accessible in
[azure monitor platform metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-containerservice-managedclusters-metrics)after the control plane is scaled up. To confirm if your control plane has been scaled up, look for the configmap 'large-cluster-control-plane-scaling-status'

```
kubectl describe configmap large-cluster-control-plane-scaling-status -n kube-system
```


- You can't use the Stop and Start feature with clusters that have more than 100 nodes. For more information, see
[Stop and start an AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster).

## Networking

As you scale your AKS clusters to larger scale points, keep the following networking best practices in mind:

- Use Managed NAT for cluster egress with at least two public IPs on the NAT gateway. For more information, see
[Create a managed NAT gateway for your AKS cluster](nat-gateway). - Use Azure CNI Overlay to scale up to 200,000 pods and 5,000 nodes per cluster. For more information, see
[Configure Azure CNI Overlay networking in AKS](azure-cni-overlay). - If your application needs direct pod-to-pod communication across clusters, use Azure CNI with dynamic IP allocation and scale up to 50,000 application pods per cluster with one routable IP per pod. For more information, see
[Configure Azure CNI networking for dynamic IP allocation in AKS](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation). - When using internal Kubernetes services behind an internal load balancer, we recommend creating an internal load balancer or service below a 750 node scale for optimal scaling performance and load balancer elasticity.
- Azure npm only supports up to 250 nodes. If you want to enforce network policies for larger clusters, consider using
[Azure CNI powered by Cilium](azure-cni-powered-by-cilium), which combines the robust control plane of Azure CNI with the Cilium data plane to provide high performance networking and security.

## Node pool scaling

As you scale your AKS clusters to larger scale points, keep the following node pool scaling best practices in mind:

- For system node pools, use the
*Standard_D16ds_v5*SKU or an equivalent core/memory VM SKU with ephemeral OS disks to provide sufficient compute resources for kube-system pods. - Since AKS has a limit of 1,000 nodes per node pool, we recommend creating at least five user node pools to scale up to 5,000 nodes.
- When running at-scale AKS clusters, use the cluster autoscaler whenever possible to ensure dynamic scaling of node pools based on the demand for compute resources. For more information, see
[Automatically scale an AKS cluster to meet application demands](cluster-autoscaler). - If you're scaling beyond 1,000 nodes and are
*not*using the cluster autoscaler, we recommend scaling in batches of 500-700 nodes at a time. The scaling operations should have a two-minute to five-minute wait time between scale up operations to prevent Azure API throttling. For more information, see[API management: Caching and throttling policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/api-management-advanced-caching-and-throttling-policies/).

## Cluster upgrade considerations and best practices

- When a cluster reaches the 5,000 node limit, cluster upgrades are blocked. This limits prevents an upgrade because there isn't available node capacity to perform rolling updates within the max surge property limit. If you have a cluster at this limit, we recommend
[scaling down the cluster](concepts-scale)under 3,000 nodes before attempting a cluster upgrade. This will provide extra capacity for node churn and minimize load on the control plane. - When upgrading clusters with more than 500 nodes, it is recommended to use a
[max surge configuration](upgrade-aks-cluster#set-max-surge-value)of 10-20% of the node pool's capacity. AKS configures upgrades with a default value of 10% for max surge. You can customize the max surge settings per node pool to enable a trade-off between upgrade speed and workload disruption. When you increase the max surge settings, the upgrade process completes faster, but you might experience disruptions during the upgrade process. For more information, see[Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade). - For more cluster upgrade information, see
[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to secure access to Azure OpenAI from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Microsoft Entra Workload ID. You learn how to:

- Enable workload identities on an AKS cluster.
- Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity.
- Create a Microsoft Entra ID federated credential.
- Enable workload identity on a Kubernetes Pod.

Note

We recommend using Microsoft Entra Workload ID and managed identities on AKS for Azure OpenAI access because it enables a secure, passwordless authentication process for accessing Azure resources.

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - This article builds on
[Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on AKS](open-ai-quickstart). You should complete that article before you begin this one. - You need a custom domain name enabled on your Azure OpenAI account to use for Microsoft Entra authorization. For more information, see
[Custom subdomain names for Azure AI services](/en-us/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains).

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

The Microsoft Entra Workload ID and OIDC Issuer Endpoint features aren't enabled on AKS by default. You must enable them on your AKS cluster before you can use them.

Set the resource group name and AKS cluster resource group name variables.

`# Set the resource group variable RG_NAME=myResourceGroup # Set the AKS cluster name based on the resource group variable AKS_NAME=$(az resource list --resource-group $RG_NAME --resource-type Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters --query "[0].name" -o tsv)`

Enable the Microsoft Entra Workload ID and OIDC Issuer Endpoint features on your existing AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --enable-workload-identity \ --enable-oidc-issuer`

Get the AKS OIDC Issuer Endpoint URL using the

command.`az aks show`

`AKS_OIDC_ISSUER=$(az aks show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $AKS_NAME --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)`


## Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity

Create an Azure user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`# Set the managed identity name variable MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME=myIdentity # Create the managed identity az identity create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME`

Get the managed identity client ID and object ID using the

command.`az identity show`

`# Get the managed identity client ID MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query clientId -o tsv) # Get the managed identity object ID MANAGED_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query principalId -o tsv)`

Get the Azure OpenAI resource ID using the

command.`az resource list`

`AOAI_RESOURCE_ID=$(az resource list --resource-group $RG_NAME --resource-type Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts --query "[0].id" -o tsv)`

Grant the managed identity access to the Azure OpenAI resource using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create \ --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \ --assignee-object-id $MANAGED_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID \ --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \ --scope $AOAI_RESOURCE_ID`


## Create a Microsoft Entra ID federated credential

Set the federated credential, namespace, and service account variables.

`# Set the federated credential name variable FEDERATED_CREDENTIAL_NAME=myFederatedCredential # Set the namespace variable SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE=default # Set the service account variable SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=ai-service-account`

Create the federated credential using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create \ --name ${FEDERATED_CREDENTIAL_NAME} \ --resource-group ${RG_NAME} \ --identity-name ${MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME} \ --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} \ --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`


## Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID on AKS

To use Microsoft Entra Workload ID on AKS, you need to make a few changes to the `ai-service`

deployment manifest.

### Create a ServiceAccount

Get the kubeconfig for your cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AKS_NAME`

Create a Kubernetes ServiceAccount using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`


### Enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on the Pod

Set the Azure OpenAI resource name, endpoint, and deployment name variables.

`# Get the Azure OpenAI resource name AOAI_NAME=$(az resource list \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --resource-type Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts \ --query "[0].name" -o tsv) # Get the Azure OpenAI endpoint AOAI_ENDPOINT=$(az cognitiveservices account show \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AOAI_NAME \ --query properties.endpoint -o tsv) # Get the Azure OpenAI deployment name AOAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(az cognitiveservices account deployment list \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $AOAI_NAME \ --query "[0].name" -o tsv)`

Redeploy the

`ai-service`

with the ServiceAccount and the`azure.workload.identity/use`

annotation set to`true`

using thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service azure.workload.identity/use: "true" spec: serviceAccountName: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: USE_AZURE_AD value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "${AOAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "${AOAI_ENDPOINT}" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi EOF`


### Test the application

Verify the new pod is running using the

command.`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get pods --selector app=ai-service`

Get the pod environment variables using the

command. The output demonstrates that the Azure OpenAI API key no longer exists in the Pod's environment variables.`kubectl describe pod`

`kubectl describe pod --selector app=ai-service`

Open a new terminal and get the IP of the store admin service using the following

`echo`

command.`echo "http://$(kubectl get svc/store-admin -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"`

Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address from the previous step.

Select

**Products**. You should be able to add a new product and get a description for it using Azure OpenAI.

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to secure access to Azure OpenAI from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Microsoft Entra Workload ID.

# Overview of managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities in AKS, including how they work, role assignments, and AKS-specific managed identity features.

To enable a managed identity on a new or existing AKS cluster, see [Use a managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-managed-identity). For more information about managed identities in Azure, see the [Managed identities for Azure resources documentation](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/).

Note

The system-assigned and user-assigned identity types differ from a [workload identity](workload-identity-overview), which is intended for use by an application running on a pod.

## AKS managed identity authorization flow

AKS clusters use system-assigned or user-assigned [managed identities](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to request tokens from Microsoft Entra. These tokens help authorize access to other resources running in Azure. You assign an [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) role to the managed identity to grant it permissions to a particular Azure resource. For example, you can grant permissions to a managed identity to access secrets in an Azure key vault for use by the cluster.

### Managed identity behavior in AKS

When you deploy an AKS cluster, a system-assigned managed identity is created for you by default. You can also create the cluster with a user-assigned managed identity, or update an existing cluster to a different type of managed identity.

If your cluster already uses a managed identity and you change the identity type (for example, from system-assigned to user-assigned), there's a delay while control plane components switch to the new identity. Control plane components continue to use the old identity until its token expires. After the token refreshes, they switch to the new identity. This process can take several hours.

Note

It's also possible to create a cluster with an application [service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) rather that a managed identity. However, we recommend using a managed identity over an application service principal for security and ease of use. If you have an existing cluster that uses an application service principal, you can update it to use a managed identity.

### AKS identity and credential management

The Azure platform manages both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities and their credentials, so you can authorize access from your applications without needing to provision or rotate any secrets.

## System-assigned managed identity

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of a system-assigned managed identity in AKS:

| Creation | Lifecycle | Sharing across resources | Common use cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| Created as part of an Azure resource, such as an AKS cluster | Tied to the lifecycle of the parent resource, so it gets deleted when the parent resource is deleted | Can only be associated with a single resource | • Workloads contained within a single Azure resource • Workloads that require independent identities |

### User-assigned managed identity

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of a user-assigned managed identity in AKS:

| Creation | Lifecycle | Sharing across resources | Common use cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| Created as a standalone Azure resource, and must exist prior to cluster creation | Independent of the lifecycle of any specific resource, so it requires manual deletion if no longer needed | Can be shared across multiple resources | • Workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity • Workloads that require preauthorization to a secure resource as part of a provisioning process • Workloads where resources are recycled frequently but need consistent permissions |

### Pre-created kubelet managed identity

A pre-created kubelet managed identity is an optional user-assigned identity that kubelet can use to access other resources in Azure. This feature enables scenarios such as connection to Azure Container Registry (ACR) during cluster creation. If you don't specify a user-assigned managed identity for kubelet, AKS creates a user-assigned kubelet identity in the node resource group. For a user-assigned kubelet identity outside the default worker node resource group, you need to assign the [Managed Identity Operator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator) role on the kubelet identity for control plane managed identity.

## Role assignments for managed identities in AKS

You can assign an Azure RBAC role to a managed identity to grant the cluster permissions on another Azure resource. Azure RBAC supports both built-in and custom role definitions that specify levels of permissions. To assign a role, see [Steps to assign an Azure role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

When you assign an Azure RBAC role to a managed identity, you must define the scope for the role. In general, it's a best practice to limit the scope of a role to the minimum privileges required by the managed identity. For more information on scoping Azure RBAC roles, see [Understand scope for Azure RBAC](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/scope-overview).

### Control plane managed identity role assignments

When you create and use your own VNet, attached Azure disks, static IP address, route table, or user-assigned kubelet identity where the resources are outside of the worker node resource group, the Azure CLI adds the role assignment automatically. If you're using an ARM template or another method, use the principal ID of the managed identity to perform a role assignment.

If you're not using the Azure CLI, but you're using your own VNet, attached Azure disks, static IP address, route table, or user-assigned kubelet identity that's outside of the worker node resource group, we recommend using a [user-assigned managed identity for the control plane](use-managed-identity#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity).

When the control plane uses a system-assigned managed identity, the identity is created at the same time as the cluster, so the role assignment can't be performed until after cluster creation.

## Summary of managed identities used by AKS

AKS uses several managed identities for built-in services and add-ons. The following table summarizes the managed identities used by AKS, their use cases, default permissions, and whether you can bring your own identity:

| Identity | Name | Use case | Default permissions | Bring your own identity |

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Ephemeral NVMe data disks provide high-performance, low-latency storage that's ideal for demanding workloads running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Many modern applications, such as AI/ML training, data analytics, and high-throughput databases, require fast temporary storage to process large volumes of intermediate data efficiently. By using ephemeral NVMe disks, you can significantly improve application responsiveness and throughput, while optimizing for cost and scalability in your AKS clusters.

In contrast to remote disks, whose performance scales with the size of the virtual machine (VM), Ephemeral NVMe disks maintain full performance regardless of vCPU count. This is because they are physically attached to the VM and operate without relying on a remote disk controller. The difference is notable:

**Ultra Disk:**Achieving 400,000 IOPS requires a 112-vCPU VM (for example,[Standard_E112ibds_v5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series#ebdsv5-series-nvme)).**Local NVMe:**An 8-vCPU VM (for example,[Standard_L8s_v3](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/storage-optimized/lsv3-series?tabs=sizestoragelocal#sizes-in-series)) can deliver 400,000 IOPS.

This results in approximately 14 times fewer vCPUs for equivalent IOPS performance, offering a substantial reduction in compute resource requirements.

This best practices article focuses on storage considerations for cluster operators. In this article, you learn:

- Common scenarios where ephemeral NVMe data disks provide performance benefits.
- How to identify which VM sizes support ephemeral NVMe data disks.
- How to use ephemeral NVMe data disks for your Kubernetes workloads.
- How ephemeral NVMe data disks work when your AKS nodes use ephemeral OS disks.
- How to measure the performance of your workloads using ephemeral NVMe data disks.

## Common scenarios of high-performance workloads

Ephemeral NVMe data disks are ideal for workloads that demand high throughput, low latency, and fast access to temporary or intermediate data. The following scenarios highlight where local NVMe disks provide the most significant benefits:

### High-performance databases (for example, PostgreSQL)

For databases such as PostgreSQL, especially in high-availability (HA) or read-intensive deployments, local NVMe disks can dramatically improve transaction throughput and reduce query latency. When used for temporary tablespaces, write-ahead logs (WAL), or as a cache layer, NVMe disks help offload I/O from persistent storage, accelerating analytics and transactional workloads.

Best practices:

- Use NVMe-backed volumes for PostgreSQL temp directories and WAL logs to maximize IOPS and minimize latency.
- For HA scenarios, ensure that persistent data directories remain on durable storage, while using NVMe for non-persistent, high-churn data.
- See
[PostgreSQL HA on AKS](/en-us/azure/aks/postgresql-ha-overview)for architecture guidance.

### AI model hosting and inference (for example, KAITO)

AI model serving platforms like [KAITO](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito) benefit from NVMe disks for rapid model loading, artifact caching, and high-throughput inference. When models are stored as Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts and loaded on demand, local NVMe storage ensures minimal cold start times and efficient batch processing.

Best practices:

- Use NVMe-backed volumes for model cache directories to accelerate model pulls and reduce inference latency.
- For distributed inference, ensure each node has sufficient NVMe capacity to cache frequently used models.
- Integrate with Kubernetes-native storage solutions (for example, Azure Container Storage) for automated management and monitoring.
- See
[KAITO model as OCI artifacts](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/next/model-as-oci-artifacts)for architecture guidance.

### Data analytics and ETL pipelines

Workloads that process large volumes of intermediate data, such as [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Dask](https://www.dask.org/), or custom ETL jobs, can apply NVMe disks for shuffle storage, temporary files, and scratch space. This approach reduces bottlenecks during data transformation and aggregation.

Best practices:

- Configure shuffle and temp directories to use NVMe-backed storage.
- Clean up temporary data promptly to maximize available space.

### Caching layers and key-value stores

In-memory databases and caching solutions (for example, Redis, Memcached, RocksDB) can use NVMe disks as a fast persistence layer or for overflow storage, providing a balance between speed and durability.

Best practices:

- Use NVMe for write-heavy cache workloads where persistence isn't critical.
- Monitor disk usage to avoid eviction or data loss due to node restarts.

### High-performance computing (HPC) and simulation

HPC workloads, including genomics, financial modeling, and scientific simulations, often require rapid access to large datasets and scratch space for intermediate results. NVMe disks provide the necessary bandwidth and low latency for these scenarios.

## Check VM sizes with ephemeral NVMe data disks

Ephemeral NVMe data disks are available on select Azure VM sizes that offer local, high-performance storage directly attached to the physical host. These disks are ideal for temporary data, such as caches, scratch files, or intermediate processing, and aren't persisted after a VM is deallocated or stopped. The number and capacity of NVMe disks vary by VM size and family.

To determine which VM sizes support ephemeral NVMe data disks and their configurations, refer to the [Azure VM documentation](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) and the [AKS supported VM sizes](/en-us/azure/aks/quotas-skus-regions). Look for VM series such as [Lsv4](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/storage-optimized/lsv4-series) and [Ddsv6](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/ddsv6-series), which are designed for high-throughput, low-latency workloads.

The following table lists example VM sizes and their NVMe disk configurations:

| VM Size | Number of NVMe Disks | Total NVMe Capacity (GiB) |
|---|---|---|
| Standard_L4s_v4 | 2 | 894 |
| Standard_L8s_v4 | 4 | 1,788 |
| Standard_L96s_v4 | 12 | 21,456 |
| Standard_D16ds_v6 | 2 | 880 |
| Standard_D32ds_v6 | 4 | 1,760 |
| Standard_D96ds_v6 | 6 | 5,280 |

For AI workloads that require GPU acceleration, consider VM sizes in the NC, ND, and NV series. Some GPU-enabled VM sizes, such as `Standard_NC48ads_A100_v4`

and `Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5`

, offer local NVMe storage in addition to powerful GPUs. These VMs are suitable for AI training, inference, and other compute-intensive scenarios where both GPU and fast local storage are needed.

Example GPU VM sizes with NVMe disks:

| VM Size | GPU Type | Number of NVMe Disks | Total NVMe Capacity (GiB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard_NC48ads_A100_v4 | 2 x A100 | 2 | 1,788 |
| Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 | 4 x A100 | 4 | 3,576 |
| Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5 | 8 x H100 | 8 | 28,610 |
| Standard_ND96isr_H200_v5 | 8 x H200 | 8 | 28,610 |

Note

Actual NVMe disk capacity and number might vary by region and VM generation. Not all GPU VM sizes include local NVMe storage. Always verify the latest VM specifications and NVMe disk availability in the Azure documentation, as configurations might change.

## Validate ephemeral NVMe data disks configuration

To ensure your AKS node is provisioned with ephemeral NVMe data disks, you can validate the configuration using the Azure CLI and by inspecting the node directly.

### Option 1: Use Azure CLI to check NVMe disk configuration

You can use the Azure CLI to inspect the VM size and attached NVMe disks with the following sample commands.

```
# Modify location and VM size if needed
locationName="eastus"
vmSize="Standard_L8s_v4"
az vm list-skus --resource-type virtualMachines --location $locationName \
--query "[?name=='$vmSize'].{
SkuName: name,
NvmeDiskSizeInMiB: capabilities[?name=='NvmeDiskSizeInMiB'] | [0].value,
NvmeSizePerDiskInMiB: capabilities[?name=='NvmeSizePerDiskInMiB'] | [0].value
}" -o table
SkuName NvmeDiskSizeInMiB NvmeSizePerDiskInMiB
--------------- ------------------- ----------------------
Standard_L8s_v4 1830912 457728
```


### Option 2: Use `lsblk`

to check disk and mount layout on the node

Login into an AKS node:

```
kubectl get nodes
# Modify the node name from above list as needed
nodeName="aks-myworkload-22647054-vmss000000"
# Use your approach to login into the node.
kubectl debug "node/$nodeName" \
--image=ubuntu \
--profile=sysadmin -it \
-- chroot /host /bin/bash
```


Once connected, use `lsblk`

to list block devices and identify NVMe disks:

```
lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL
NAME HCTL SIZE MOUNTPOINT MODEL
sr0 0:0:0:2 750K Virtual DVD-ROM
nvme0n1 110G Microsoft NVMe Direct Disk v2
```


NVMe disks typically appear as `nvme*n1`

and are configured with `Microsoft NVMe Direct Disk*`

on model. This result confirms the presence and configuration of ephemeral NVMe data disks on your AKS node.

## Use ephemeral NVMe data disks in workloads

There are several ways to use ephemeral NVMe data disks in your AKS workloads. The most common approaches are:

### Azure Container Storage (recommended)

[Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction) is a Kubernetes-native storage solution that abstracts and manages local NVMe disks as persistent volumes, with advanced orchestration and data services.

You can deploy Azure Container Storage in your AKS cluster and provision volumes using standard Kubernetes PVCs.

Azure Container Storage offers the following advantages:

- Kubernetes-native experience with PersistentVolumeClaims.
- Automated discovery and management of NVMe disks for any VM sizes.
- Supports advanced features: dynamic provisioning, data security, and native integration with AKS.
- Improved reliability and operational simplicity.
- Enables high-performance workloads with default volume striping cross all available disks.

Azure Container Storage is the best option for Kubernetes workloads to orchestrate ephemeral NVMe data disks. It combines the raw performance of NVMe disks with Kubernetes-native management, security, and built-in integration with Azure’s monitoring features and Prometheus. This approach reduces operational complexity, improves reliability, and enables advanced scenarios (such as scaling and failover) that are difficult to achieve with `emptyDir`

or `hostPath`

.

For more information, see [Azure Container Storage documentation](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction).

`emptyDir`

Volumes

`emptyDir`

is a Kubernetes volume type that uses the node's local storage. When backed by NVMe disks, `emptyDir`

provides high throughput and low latency for temporary data.

To use this method, define an `emptyDir`

volume in your Pod spec. By default, it uses the fastest available storage (NVMe if present).

#### Advantages

- Simple to use and configure.
- No external dependencies.
- High performance when backed by NVMe.

#### Disadvantages

- Data is lost if the Pod is rescheduled to another node.
- No data persistence or replication.
- Limited to single NVMe disk.

`hostPath`

Volumes

`hostPath`

mounts a specific directory or disk from the node’s filesystem into the Pod. You can target NVMe mount points directly.

To use this method, specify the NVMe disk path (for example, `/mnt`

or `/mnt/nvme0n1`

) in the Pod spec.

#### Advantages

- Direct access to NVMe disk.
- Useful for advanced scenarios (for example, custom formatting, partitioning).

#### Disadvantages

- Tightly coupled to node layout; not portable.
- Security risks if not properly restricted.
- Limited to single NVMe disk.

## Ephemeral NVMe data disks with ephemeral OS disks

When deploying AKS nodes with local NVMe data disks, such as the `Standard_D2ads_v6`

VM size (single 100 GiB NVMe disk) with ephemeral OS disks setting opt-in, you might observe that the ephemeral OS disk (for example, 60 GiB) is provisioned from the NVMe capacity. However, the unused NVMe space (in this example, the extra 40 GiB) isn’t available to use, and there’s no supported way to access or recover it after the node is created.

This behavior is by design, as the ephemeral OS disk requirements dictate how the NVMe device is partitioned at provisioning time. It can be confusing since you don’t get access to all of its storage, especially with many VM sizes that come with only one NVMe disk.

Use the following example to validate this behavior:

```
# Create Standard_D2ads_v6 (Single 100 GiB NVMe disk) node pool using ephemeral OS disk with 60 GiB capacity
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group $resourceGroup \
--cluster-name $clusterName \
--name $nodePoolName \
--node-count 1 \
--node-vm-size Standard_D2ads_v6 \
--node-osdisk-type Ephemeral \
--node-osdisk-size 60
kubectl debug "node/$nodeName" \
--image=ubuntu \
--profile=sysadmin -it \
-- chroot /host /bin/bash
lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT,SIZE,VENDOR,MODEL
NAME FSTYPE LABEL MOUNTPOINT SIZE VENDOR MODEL
sr0 750K Msft Virtual DVD-ROM
nvme0n1 60G MSFT NVMe Accelerator v1.0
|-nvme0n1p1 ext4 cloudimg-rootfs / 59.9G
|-nvme0n1p14 4M
`-nvme0n1p15 vfat UEFI /boot/efi 106M
```


When you use VM sizes with a single local NVMe data disk and enable ephemeral OS disk, the OS consumes the entire NVMe disk, leaving no space available for Kubernetes workloads to provision persistent volumes. For VM sizes with two or more local NVMe data disks, one disk is used for the ephemeral OS, and the others can be used to provision persistent volumes for your workloads.

### Current limitations

- The ephemeral OS disk consumes a portion of one local NVMe drive, with the remainder left inaccessible.
- There's no supported way to access or mount the unused NVMe space after node creation.
- You can't update or repartition the NVMe disk post-deployment.

### Customer impact

- Reduced usable NVMe capacity compared to what is advertised for the VM size.
- Inability to fully use high-performance local storage for workloads.
- Potential confusion and inconvenience during upgrades or node replacement.

### Recommendation

Decide the intended use of local NVMe disks, either for the OS disk or for Kubernetes workload storage—before provisioning AKS nodes. Ephemeral OS disk configuration is immutable after node creation, so planning ahead avoids the need to recreate nodes if requirements change.

Omit the OS disk size input when creating AKS nodes with ephemeral OS disks on NVMe-backed VMs. This prevents misconfiguration and aligns with product documentation, reducing the risk of inaccessible capacity and upgrade issues.


Note

These improvements are important for user experience and operational efficiency, especially as more VM SKUs with single NVMe disks become available. Follow the latest AKS documentation and monitor Azure updates for enhancements in ephemeral disk management.

## Measure workload performance with ephemeral NVMe data disks

Ephemeral NVMe data disks deliver high throughput and low latency for AKS workloads, but it's important to validate performance against your application's requirements. Benchmark your workloads on different VM sizes to identify the optimal configuration, and adjust VM sizes or disk configurations as needed.

Set up your application using local NVMe volumes, then use workload-specific benchmarking tools to measure IOPS, throughput, and latency. For example, with PostgreSQL, follow [Create infrastructure for PostgreSQL](/en-us/azure/aks/create-postgresql-ha) to deploy your environment, and use [pgbench](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.26/benchmarking/#pgbench) to evaluate database performance.

The following steps introduce generic benchmarking with fio and local NVMe volumes managed by Azure Container Storage.

Enable Azure Container Storage on your AKS cluster. See

[Azure Container Storage Quickstart](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-aks-quickstart)Deploy storage class, generic volume, fio pod with local NVMe volumes. See

[Use local NVMe with Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/use-container-storage-with-local-disk).Run the following fio command and modify as needed.

`# Run fio benchmark kubectl exec -it fiopod -- fio --directory=/mnt/cns --size=4000MB --filename_format='testfile.$jobnum' --wait_for_previous \ --thread --group_reporting --direct=1 --randrepeat=0 --norandommap=1 \ --ioengine=io_uring --numjobs=8 --disable_clat=1 --disable_slat=1 \ --name=precondition --bs=1M --iodepth=64 --rw=write \ --name=randwritebench --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --iodepth=16 --time_based --runtime=60 \ --name=randreadbench --rw=randread --bs=4k --iodepth=16 --time_based --runtime=60 \ --name=seqwritebench --rw=write --bs=128k --iodepth=16 --time_based --runtime=60 \ --name=seqreadbench --rw=read --bs=128k --iodepth=16 --time_based --runtime=60 > ./fio.log result=$(cat ./fio.log | \ awk ' BEGIN { print "Scenario,Type,IOPS,BW(MiB/s)" } /^[a-z]+bench:/ { split($1, a, ":") scenario = a[1] } /read: IOPS=/ && scenario ~ /(randreadbench|seqreadbench)/ { type = "read" match($0, /IOPS=([0-9.]+)([kM]?)/, iops_arr) match($0, /BW=([0-9.]+)MiB\/s/, bw_arr) iops = iops_arr[1] unit = iops_arr[2] if (unit == "k") iops *= 1000 else if (unit == "M") iops *= 1000000 bw = bw_arr[1] printf "%s,%s,%.0f,%.2f\n", scenario, type, iops, bw } /write: IOPS=/ && scenario ~ /(randwritebench|seqwritebench)/ { type = "write" match($0, /IOPS=([0-9.]+)([kM]?)/, iops_arr) match($0, /BW=([0-9.]+)MiB\/s/, bw_arr) iops = iops_arr[1] unit = iops_arr[2] if (unit == "k") iops *= 1000 else if (unit == "M") iops *= 1000000 bw = bw_arr[1] printf "%s,%s,%.0f,%.2f\n", scenario, type, iops, bw } ' | column -t -s,)`

Run fio on the VM with single NVMe disk (for example, standard_l8s_v3) and the VM with two NVMe disks (for example, Standard_L16s_v3). Evaluate the performance improvements from the NVMe volume striping cross multiple NVMe disks. See the following charts as examples:

# Optimize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) usage and costs

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides guidance on how to optimize your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) usage and costs. It covers guidance on the following topics:

## Automatic scaling

### Horizontal pod autoscaling

The * Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)* monitors resource demand and automatically updates a workload resource to automatically scale the number of pods to match demand. The response to increased load is to deploy more pods. If the load decreases and the number of pods is above the configured minimum, the autoscaler tells the workload resource to scale down.

The Metrics API gets data from the kubelet every 60 seconds, and the HPA checks the Metrics API every 15 seconds for any needed changes by default. This means that the HPA updates every 60 seconds. When you configure the HPA for a deployment, you define the minimum and maximum number of replicas that can run and the metrics that the HPA uses to determine when to scale.

For more information, see [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) and [Autoscale pods in AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-scale#autoscale-pods).

### Kubernetes event-driven autoscaling

The [Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaler (KEDA)](https://keda.sh/) applies event-driven autoscaling to your workloads. KEDA works with the HPA and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication.

You can use the KEDA add-on for AKS to scale your applications and leverage a [rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/2.16/scalers/). For more information, see [Application autoscaling with the KEDA add-on](keda-about) and [Install the KEDA add-on for AKS](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

### Vertical pod autoscaling

The * Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)* automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage. The VPA frees up CPU and Memory for pods to ensure effective utilization of your AKS clusters. Over time, the VPA provides recommendations for resource usage.

For more information, see [Vertical pod autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](vertical-pod-autoscaler) and [Use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-vertical-pod-autoscaler).

## Cluster right-sizing

### Right-size your cluster

It's important to * right-size your clusters* to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

For more information, see [Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](resize-cluster).

### Cluster autoscaling

With the * cluster autoscaler*, you can automatically scale node pools based on resource usage and constraints, such as scaling up to schedule pending pods or scaling down to reduce costs for unused nodes. The

[cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler-overview#cluster-autoscaler-profile)is a set of parameters that you can fine-tune to control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler.

For more information, see [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview) and [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

### Node autoprovisioning (preview)

* Node autoprovisioning (NAP)* (preview), based on the open-source

[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/)project, helps you provision the right infrastructure based on the pending pod resource requirements of your workloads. With efficient bin-packing, you can consolidate your workloads onto the right-sized infrastructure to reduce operating costs.

For more information, see [Node autoprovisioning (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](node-autoprovision).

## GPU optimizations

### GPU partitioning and sharing

GPU partitioning helps combat underutilization by splitting up or sharing GPUs across multiple workloads. The following sections cover different ways to partition and share GPUs in AKS.

#### Time-slicing

The [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) enables the * time-slicing* of GPUs in Kubernetes clusters. With time-slicing, a system administrator can define a set of

*replicas*for a GPU, each of which can be handed out independently to a pod to run workloads on. You can apply cluster-wide default time-slicing configurations and node-specific configurations.


For more information, see [Time-slicing GPUs in Kubernetes](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-sharing.html).

#### Multi-processing service (MPS)

A single process might not utilize all the memory and compute bandwidth capacity available on a GPU. The * Multi-Process Service (MPS)* enables logical partitioning of memory and compute resources between workloads and allows kernel and memcopy operations from different processes to overlap on the GPU. MPS helps you achieve higher GPU utilization and shorter running times.


For more information, see [Multi-Process Service (MPS)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html#mps).

#### Multi-instance GPUs (MIGs)

* Multi-instance GPUs (MIGs)* enable you to partition GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ampere and later architectures into separate and secure GPU instances for CUDA applications.


For more information, see [GPU Operator with MIG](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-operator-mig.html) and [Create a multi-instance GPU node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](gpu-multi-instance).

## Multitenancy

Multitenancy refers to the sharing of infrastructure across tenants, teams, and business units. The following table outlines different ways to implement multitenancy in AKS:

| Multitenancy type | Multitenancy level | Cluster pod density | Cost allocation | Ideal use case | Potential risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Dedicated cluster |

• Lower pod density and more overprovisioned resources

**Dedicated node pool**• Requires extra cluster configurations, like network policies, quota management, role-based access control (RBAC), etc.

**Dedicated namespace**• Requires extra cluster configurations, like network policies, quota management, role-based access control (RBAC), etc.

### Dedicated cluster

With * dedicated cluster multitenancy*, clusters are dedicated to a single workload or team.


The following table outlines pros and cons of using a dedicated cluster:

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| • Easier isolation method • Straightforward cost allocation and chargeback • Great for cases where tenants don't trust each other (often from security and resource sharing perspectives) |
• High management and financial overhead • Generally low pod density and overprovisioned resources |

### Dedicated node pool

With * dedicated node pool multitenancy*, clusters are shared by many tenants.


The following table outlines pros and cons of using a dedicated node pool:

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| • Medium pod density • Some shared infrastructure • Apply Azure tags to node pools dedicated to a single tenant (tags propagate to nodes and persist through upgrades) |
• Requires trust between the tenants • Requires extra cluster configurations, like network policies, quota management, role-based access control (RBAC), etc. |

### Dedicated namespace

With * dedicated namespace multitenancy*, clusters are shared by many tenants, with namespaces serving as the isolation boundary.


The following table outlines pros and cons of using a dedicated namespace:

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| • Higher pod density • Best binpacking • Sharing infrastructure to maximize resource utilization |
• Unsafe for hostile environments by default • Requires extra security measures in place if all tenants can't be trusted |

## Azure discounts

To take savings one step further, take advantage of Azure discounts such as Azure Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Azure Hybrid Benefits.

| Azure discount type | Details |
|---|---|
Azure Savings Plans |

• Save up to 65% compared to pay-as-you-go

• Flexible, with no SKU family or region restrictions

• Best for workloads with consistent costs with resources in various SKUs and regions

**Reserved Instances**• Save up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go

• Restricted to specific SKU families and regions

• Best for stable workloads running continuously (with no unexpected SKU or region changes)

**Azure Hybrid Benefits**• Use any qualifying on-premises licenses that have an active Software Assurance (SA) or qualifying subscription

Security updates are a key part of maintaining your AKS cluster's security and compliance with the latest fixes for the underlying OS. These updates include OS security fixes or kernel updates. Some updates require a node reboot to complete the process.

This article shows you how you can automate the update process of AKS nodes using GitHub Actions and Azure CLI to create an update task based on `cron`

that runs automatically.

Note

You can also perform node image upgrades automatically and schedule these upgrades using planned maintenance. For more information, see [Automatically upgrade node images](auto-upgrade-node-image).

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[the Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - This article also assumes you have a
[GitHub account](https://github.com)and a[profile repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile)to host your actions. If you don't have a repository, create one with the same name as your GitHub username. - You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update nodes with `az aks upgrade`


The `az aks upgrade`

command gives you a zero downtime way to apply updates. The command performs the following actions:

- Applies the latest updates to all your cluster's nodes.
- Cordons (makes the node unavailable for the scheduling of new workloads) and drains (moves the existent workloads to other node) traffic to the nodes.
- Restarts the nodes.
- Enables the updated nodes to receive traffic again.

AKS doesn't automatically restart your nodes if you update them using a different method.

Note

Running `az aks upgrade`

with the `--node-image-only`

flag only upgrades the node images. Running the command without the flag upgrades both the node images and the Kubernetes control plane version. For more information, see the [docs for managed upgrades on nodes](node-image-upgrade) and the [docs for cluster upgrades](upgrade-cluster).

All Kubernetes nodes run in a standard Windows or Linux-based Azure virtual machine (VM). The Linux-based VMs use an Ubuntu image with the OS configured to automatically check for updates every night.

When you use the `az aks upgrade`

command, Azure CLI creates a surge of new nodes with the latest security and kernel updates. These new nodes are initially cordoned to prevent any apps from being scheduled to them until the update completes. After the update completes, Azure cordons and drains the older nodes and uncordons the new ones, transferring all the scheduled applications to the new nodes.

This process is better than updating Linux-based kernels manually because Linux requires a reboot when a new kernel update is installed. If you update the OS manually, you also need to reboot the VM, manually cordoning and draining all the apps.

## Create a timed GitHub Action

`cron`

is a utility that allows you to run a set of commands, or *jobs*, on an automated schedule. To create a job to update your AKS nodes on an automated schedule, you need a repository to host your actions. GitHub Actions are usually configured in the same repository as your application, but you can use any repository.

Navigate to your repository on GitHub.

Select

**Actions**.Select

**New workflow**>**Set up a workflow yourself**.Create a GitHub Action named

*Upgrade cluster node images*with a schedule trigger to run every 15 days at 3am. Copy the following code into the YAML:`name: Upgrade cluster node images on: schedule: - cron: '0 3 */15 * *'`

Create a job named

*upgrade-node*that runs on an Ubuntu agent and connects to your Azure CLI account to execute the node upgrade command. Copy the following code into the YAML under the`on`

key:`jobs: upgrade-node: runs-on: ubuntu-latest`


## Set up the Azure CLI in the workflow

In the

**Search Marketplace for Actions**bar, search for**Azure Login**.Select

**Azure Login**.Under

**Installation**, select a version, such as*v1.4.6*, and copy the installation code snippet.Add the

`steps`

key and the following information from the installation code snippet to the YAML:`name: Upgrade cluster node images on: schedule: - cron: '0 3 */15 * *' jobs: upgrade-node: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Azure Login uses: Azure/login@v1.4.6 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}`


## Create credentials for the Azure CLI

In a new browser window, create a new service principal using the

command. Make sure you replace`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`*{subscriptionID}*`

with your own subscription ID.Note

This example creates the

`Contributor`

role at the*Subscription*scope. You can provide the role and scope that meets your needs. For more information, see[Azure built-in roles](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles)and[Azure RBAC scope levels](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/scope-overview#scope-format).`az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscriptionID} -o json`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "xxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx", "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the output and navigate to your GitHub repository.

Select

**Settings**>**Secrets and variables**>**Actions**>**New repository secret**.For

**Name**, enter`AZURE_CREDENTIALS`

.For

**Secret**, copy in the contents of the output you received when you created the service principal.Select

**Add Secret**.

## Create the steps to execute the Azure CLI commands

Navigate to your window with the workflow YAML.

In the

**Search Marketplace for Actions**bar, search for**Azure CLI Action**.Select

**Azure CLI Action**.Under

**Installation**, select a version, such as*v1.0.8*, and copy the installation code snippet.Paste the contents of the action into the YAML below the

`*Azure Login*`

step, similar to the following example:`name: Upgrade cluster node images on: schedule: - cron: '0 3 */15 * *' jobs: upgrade-node: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Azure Login uses: Azure/login@v1.4.6 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Upgrade node images uses: Azure/cli@v1.0.8 with: inlineScript: az aks upgrade --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --name <aksClusterName> --node-image-only --yes`

Tip

You can decouple the

`--resource-group`

and`--name`

parameters from the command by creating new repository secrets like you did for`AZURE_CREDENTIALS`

.If you create secrets for these parameters, you need to replace the

`<resourceGroupName>`

and`<aksClusterName>`

placeholders with their secret counterparts. For example,`${{secrets.RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}}`

and`${{secrets.AKS_CLUSTER_NAME}}`

Rename the YAML to

`upgrade-node-images.yml`

.Select

**Commit changes...**, add a commit message, and then select**Commit changes**.

## Run the GitHub Action manually

You can run the workflow manually in addition to the scheduled run by adding a new `on`

trigger called `workflow_dispatch`

.

Note

If you want to upgrade a single node pool instead of all node pools on the cluster, add the `--name`

parameter to the `az aks nodepool upgrade`

command to specify the node pool name. For example:

```
az aks nodepool upgrade --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-name <aksClusterName> --name <nodePoolName> --node-image-only
```


Add the

`workflow_dispatch`

trigger under the`on`

key:`name: Upgrade cluster node images on: schedule: - cron: '0 3 */15 * *' workflow_dispatch:`

The YAML should look similar to the following example:

`name: Upgrade cluster node images on: schedule: - cron: '0 3 */15 * *' workflow_dispatch: jobs: upgrade-node: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Azure Login uses: Azure/login@v1.4.6 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} - name: Upgrade node images uses: Azure/cli@v1.0.8 with: inlineScript: az aks upgrade -g {resourceGroupName} -n {aksClusterName} --node-image-only --yes # Code for upgrading one or more node pools`

**Apply new ContainerNetworkLog CRD**: Apply your updated CRD configuration with the new naming.**Reimport Grafana Dashboards**: Import the updated dashboards to reflect the new table names.

Note

- Previously collected data stays in your workspace in old table RetinaNetworkFlowLogs.
- After re-enabling, allow a short delay before new data appears in new table ContainerNetworkLog.

In this article, you complete the steps to configure and use the container network logs feature in Advanced Container Networking Services for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These logs offer persistent network flow monitoring tailored to enhance visibility in containerized environments.

By capturing container network logs, you can effectively track network traffic, detect anomalies, optimize performance, and ensure compliance with established policies. Follow the detailed instructions provided to set up and integrate container network logs for your system. For more information about the container network logs feature, see [Overview of container network logs](container-network-observability-logs).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


The minimum version of the Azure CLI required to complete the steps in this article is 2.75.0. To find your version, run

`az --version`

in the Azure CLI. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).Container network logs in stored logs mode work only for Cilium data planes.

Container network logs in on-demand mode work for both Cilium and non-Cilium data planes.

If your existing cluster is version 1.33 or earlier, upgrade the cluster to the latest available Kubernetes version.

The minimum version of the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension to complete the steps in this article is`19.0.07`

.

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension by using the [ az extension add](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-add) or

[command.](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-update)

`az extension update`

```
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview
# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```


### Register the AdvancedNetworkingFlowLogsPreview feature flag

First, register the AdvancedNetworkingFlowLogsPreview feature flag by using the [ az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command:

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingFlowLogsPreview"
```


Verify successful registration by using the [ az feature show](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-show) command. It takes a few minutes for registration to complete.

```
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingFlowLogsPreview"
```


When the feature shows **Registered**, refresh the registration of the `Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider by using the [ az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command.

## Limitations

- Layer 7 flow data is captured only when Layer 7 policy support is enabled. For more information, see
[Configure a Layer 7 policy](how-to-apply-l7-policies). - Domain Name System (DNS) flows and related metrics are captured only when a Cilium Fully Qualified Domain (FQDN) network policy is applied. For more information, see
[Configure an FQDN policy](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies). - Onboarding by using Terraform isn't supported at this time.
- When Log Analytics isn't configured for log storage, container network logs are limited to a maximum of 50 MB of storage. When this limit is reached, new entries overwrite older logs.
- If the log table plan is set to Basic logs, the prebuilt Grafana dashboards don't function as expected.
- The Auxiliary logs table plan isn't supported.

## Configure stored logs mode for container network logs

### Deployment methods

You can onboard to container network logs using different deployment methods:

This section provides two paths for setting up container network logs based on your current situation:

: Complete setup for new AKS clusters[New clusters](#new-clusters): Enable container network logs on existing AKS clusters[Existing clusters](#existing-clusters)

## New clusters

This section guides you through setting up container network logs on a new AKS cluster from start to finish.

### Create a new AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services

Use the `az aks create`

command with the `--enable-acns`

flag to create a new AKS cluster that has all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features include:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insight into your network traffic. To learn more, see[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more, see[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security).

--enable-acns
```


### Configure custom resources for log filtering

To configure container network logs in stored logs mode, you must define specific custom resources to set filters for log collection. When at least one custom resource is defined, logs are collected and stored on the host node at `/var/log/acns/hubble/events.log`

.

To configure logging, you must define and apply the `ContainerNetworkLog`

type of custom resource. You set filters like namespace, pod, service, port, protocol, and verdict. Multiple custom resources can exist in a cluster simultaneously. If no custom resource is defined with nonempty filters, no logs are saved in the designated location.

The following sample definition demonstrates how to configure the `ContainerNetworkLog`

type of custom resource.

### ContainerNetworkLog CRD template

```
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkLog
metadata:
name: sample-containernetworklog # Cluster scoped
spec:
includefilters: # List of filters
- name: sample-filter # Filter name
from:
namespacedPod: # List of source namespace/pods. Prepend namespace with /
- sample-namespace/sample-pod
labelSelector: # Standard k8s label selector
matchLabels:
app: frontend
k8s.io/namespace: sample-namespace
matchExpressions:
- key: environment
operator: In
values:
- production
- staging
ip: # List of source IPs; can be CIDR
- "192.168.1.10"
- "10.0.0.1"
to:
namespacedPod:
- sample-namespace2/sample-pod2
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
k8s.io/namespace: sample-namespace2
matchExpressions:
- key: tier
operator: NotIn
values:
- dev
ip:
- "192.168.1.20"
- "10.0.1.1"
protocol: # List of protocols; can be tcp, udp, dns
- tcp
- udp
- dns
verdict: # List of verdicts; can be forwarded, dropped
- forwarded
- dropped
```


The following table describes the fields in the custom resource definition:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
`includefilters` |
[]filter | A list of filters that define network flows to include. Each filter specifies the source, destination, protocol, and other matching criteria. Include filters can't be empty and must have at least one filter. | Mandatory |
`filters.name` |
String | The name of the filter. | Optional |
`filters.protocol` |
[]string | The protocols to match for this filter. Valid values are `tcp` , `udp` , and `dns` . This parameter is optional. If not specified, logs with all protocols are included. |
Optional |
`filters.verdict` |
[]string | The verdict of the flow to match. Valid values are `forwarded` and `dropped` . This parameter is optional. If not specified, logs with all verdicts are included. |
Optional |
`filters.from` |
Endpoint | Specifies the source of the network flow. Can include IP addresses, label selectors, and namespace/pod pairs. | Optional |
`Endpoint.ip` |
[]string | It can be a single IP or a CIDR. | Optional |
`Endpoint.labelSelector` |
Object | A label selector is a mechanism to filter and query resources based on labels, so you can identify specific subsets of resources. A label selector can include two components: `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` . Use `matchLabels` for straightforward matching by specifying a key/value pair (for example, `{"app": "frontend"}` ). For more advanced criteria, use `matchExpressions` , where you define a label key, an operator (such as `In` , `NotIn` , `Exists` , or `DoesNotExist` ), and an optional list of values. Ensure that the conditions in both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` are met, because they're logically combined by `AND` . If no conditions are specified, the selector matches all resources. To match none, leave the selector null. Carefully define your label selector to target the correct set of resources. |
Optional |
`Endpoint.namespacedPod` |
[]string | A list of namespace and pod pairs (formatted as `namespace/pod` ) for matching the source. `name` should match the RegEx pattern `^.+$` . |
Optional |
`filters.to` |
Endpoint | Specifies the destination of the network flow. Can include IP addresses, label selectors, or namespace/pod pairs. | Optional |
`Endpoint.ip` |
[]string | It can be a single IP or a CIDR. | Optional |
`Endpoint.labelSelector` |
Object | A label selector to match resources based on their labels. | Optional |
`Endpoint.namespacedPod` |
[]string | A list of namespace and pod pairs (formatted as `namespace/pod` ) to match the destination. |
Optional |

Apply the

`ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resource to enable log collection at the cluster:`kubectl apply -f <crd.yaml>`

Tip

For a practical example of a ContainerNetworkLog custom resource configuration, see the

[sample CRD in the AKS Labs documentation](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/networking/acns-lab/#enable-flow-logs-for-the-pets-namespace).

Logs stored locally on host nodes are temporary because the host or node itself isn't a persistent storage solution. Logs on host nodes are also rotated when their size reaches 50 MB. For longer-term storage and analysis, we recommend that you configure the Azure Monitor Agent on the cluster to collect and retain logs in the Log Analytics workspace.

Alternatively, you can integrate a partner logging service like an OpenTelemetry collector for more log management options.

### Configure Azure Monitor for managed storage (recommended)

For persistent storage and advanced analytics, configure the Azure Monitor Agent to collect and store logs in a Log Analytics workspace:

```
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure you replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<aks-resource-group>"
# Enable azure monitor with high log scale mode
### To use the default Log Analytics workspace
az aks enable-addons -a monitoring --enable-high-log-scale-mode -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME
### To use an existing Log Analytics workspace
az aks enable-addons -a monitoring --enable-high-log-scale-mode -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --workspace-resource-id <workspace-resource-id>
# Update the AKS cluster with the enable-container-network-logs flag
az aks update --enable-acns \
--enable-container-network-logs \
-g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
-n $CLUSTER_NAME
```


Note

When enabled, container network flow logs are written to `/var/log/acns/hubble/events.log`

when the `ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resource is applied. If Log Analytics integration is enabled later, the Azure Monitor Agent begins collecting logs at that point. Logs older than two minutes aren't ingested. Only new entries that are appended after monitoring begins are collected in a Log Analytics workspace.

## Existing clusters

Note

If your cluster already has Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) enabled, you can start collecting flow logs on the host node by simply applying a ContainerNetworkLog CRD. However, if you want to enable flow logs with Log Analytics workspace integration for persistent storage and advanced analytics, follow the steps in the [Configure integration with log analytics on existing cluster](#configure-integration-with-log-analytics-on-existing-cluster) section.

```
# Set environment variables for your existing cluster. Make sure you replace the placeholders with your own values.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<aks-resource-group>"
```


### Configure integration with log analytics on existing cluster

To enable container network logs on an existing cluster:

Check whether monitoring add-ons are already enabled on that cluster:

`az aks addon list -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME`

If monitoring add-ons are enabled, disable monitoring add-ons:

`az aks disable-addons -a monitoring -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME`

Complete this step because monitoring add-ons might already be enabled, but not for high scale. For more information, see

[High-scale mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-high-scale).Set Azure Monitor to

`enable-high-log-scale-mode`

:`### Use default Log Analytics workspace az aks enable-addons -a monitoring --enable-high-log-scale-mode -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME ### Use existing Log Analytics workspace az aks enable-addons -a monitoring --enable-high-log-scale-mode -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --workspace-resource-id <workspace-resource-id>`

Update the AKS cluster with the

`enable-container-network-logs`

flag:`az aks update --enable-acns \ --enable-container-network-logs \ -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \ -n $CLUSTER_NAME`

Create the CRD as per the

[ContainerNetworkLog template](#containernetworklog-crd-template)mentioned above and apply it to start log collection in log analytics workspace.Tip

For a practical example of a ContainerNetworkLog custom resource configuration, see the

[sample CRD in the AKS Labs documentation](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/networking/acns-lab/#enable-flow-logs-for-the-pets-namespace).

**Viewing L7 flows and DNS errors**

To capture Layer 7 (L7) flow data and DNS errors/flows in your container network logs, you must apply Cilium network policies with FQDN filtering and L7 policy support enabled. Without these policies, L7 and DNS-related flow information won't be captured.

Example of a Cilium network policy with FQDN filtering and L7 support:

```
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: l7-dns-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: UDP
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "443"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/1"
```


Apply the policy using:

```
kubectl apply -f l7-dns-policy.yaml
```


For more information, see [Configure a Layer 7 policy](how-to-apply-l7-policies) and [Configure an FQDN policy](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies)

## Common post-setup steps to verify configuration

The following steps apply to both new and existing cluster setups.

### Get cluster credentials

Get your cluster credentials by using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command:

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


### Validate the setup

Validate that the retina network flow log capability is enabled:

```
az aks show -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME
```


Expected output:

```
"networkProfile":{
"advancedNetworking": {
"enabled": true,
"observability":{
"enabled": true
}
}
}
----------------------------
"osmagent":{
"config":{
"enableContainerNetworkLogs": "True"
}
}
```


Check which custom resource definitions are installed for flow logs:

```
kubectl get containernetworklog
```


This command lists all the `ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resources created in the cluster.

Validate that the `ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resource is applied:

```
k describe containernetworklog <cr-name>
```


Expect to see a `Spec`

node that contains `Include filters`

and a `Status`

node. The value for `Status`

> `State`

should be `CONFIGURED`

(not `FAILED`

).

```
Spec:
Includefilters:
From:
Namespaced Pod:
namespace/pod-
Name: sample-filter
Protocol:
tcp
To:
Namespaced Pod:
namespace/pod-
Verdict:
dropped
Status:
State: CONFIGURED
Timestamp: 2025-05-01T11:24:48Z
```


Users can apply multiple `ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resources in the cluster. Each custom resource has its own status.

### Querying Container Network Flow Logs in Log Analytics dashboard

When Container Network Flow Logs are enabled with a Log Analytics workspace, you have access to historical logs that allow you to analyze network traffic patterns over time. You can query these logs using the `ContainerNetworkLog`

table to perform detailed forensic analysis and troubleshooting.

Customers can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze network data in Log Analytics. This historical data is invaluable for understanding network behavior patterns, identifying security incidents, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and performing root cause analysis over extended periods. The ability to correlate network events across time helps detect intermittent issues and understand traffic flows that may not be apparent in real-time monitoring.

To see sample queries that can be applied for troubleshooting connectivity issues, refer to the [progressive diagnosis using flow logs](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/networking/acns-lab/#progressive-diagnosis-using-flow-logs) in the AKS Labs documentation.

### Azure Managed Grafana

You can access prebuilt Grafana dashboards through the Azure portal. Navigate to either the Azure Monitor resource or your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to view and interact with these dashboards. But before that:

Make sure that the Azure logs pods are running:

`kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system | grep ama-logs`

Your output should look similar to the following example:

`ama-logs-9bxc6 3/3 Running 1 (39m ago) 44m ama-logs-fd568 3/3 Running 1 (40m ago) 44m ama-logs-rs-65bdd98f75-hqnd2 2/2 Running 1 (43m ago) 22h`

Ensure that your Managed Grafana workspace can access and search all monitoring data in the relevant subscription. This step is required to access prebuilt dashboards for network flow logs.

**Use case 1**: If you're a subscription Owner or a User Access Administrator, when a Managed Grafana workspace is created, it comes with the Monitoring Reader role granted on all Azure Monitor data and Log Analytics resources in the subscription. The new Managed Grafana workspace can access and search all monitoring data in the subscription. It can view the Azure Monitor metrics and logs from all resources and view any logs stored in Log Analytics workspaces in the subscription.**Use case 2**: If you're not a subscription Owner or User Access Administrator, or if your Log Analytics and Managed Grafana workspaces are in different subscriptions, Grafana can't access Log Analytics and the subscription. The Grafana workspace must have the Monitoring Reader role in the relevant subscription to access prebuilt Grafana dashboards. In this scenario, complete these steps to provide access:In your Managed Grafana workspace, go to

**Settings**>**Identity**.Select

**Azure role assignments**>**Add role assignments**.For

**Scope**, enter**Subscription**. Select your subscription. Set**Role**to**Monitoring Reader**, and then select**Save**.Verify the data source for the Managed Grafana instance. To verify the subscription for the data source for the Grafana dashboards, check the

**Data source**tab in the Managed Grafana instance:


#### Visualization in Grafana dashboards

Azure Monitor dashboards with Grafana enable you to use Grafana's query, transformation, and visualization capabilities on metrics and logs collected in Azure Monitor. You can use this option as an alternative to visualize container network flow logs.

- Navigate to the left pane of the Kubernetes cluster in the Azure portal.
- Select
**Dashboards with Grafana (Preview)**. - Browse the list of available dashboards in the Azure Monitor or Azure Managed Prometheus listings.
- Select a dashboard, for example
**Azure | Insights | Containers | Networking | Flow Logs**.

You can visualize container network flow logs for analysis by using two prebuilt Grafana dashboards. You can access the dashboards either through Azure Managed Grafana or in the Azure portal.

To simplify log analysis, we provide two preconfigured Azure Managed Grafana dashboards:

Go to

**Azure**>**Insights**>**Containers**>**Networking**>**Flow Logs**. This dashboard provides visualizations in which AKS workloads communicate with each other, including network requests, responses, drops, and errors. Currently, you must use[ID 23155](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/23155-azure-insights-containers-networking-flow-logs//)to import these dashboards.Go to

**Azure**>**Insights**>**Containers**>**Networking**>**Flow Logs (External Traffic)**. This dashboard provides visualizations in which AKS workloads send and receive communications from outside an AKS cluster, including network requests, responses, drops, and errors. Use[ID 23156](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/23156-azure-insights-containers-networking-flow-logs-external-traffic//).

For more information about how to use this dashboard, see the [overview of container network logs](container-network-observability-logs).

## Configure on-demand logs mode

On-demand logs mode for network flows works with both Cilium and non-Cilium data planes.

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) enabled.

The `az aks create`

command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`

, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. The features include:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more, visit[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more, visit[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security).

Note

Clusters that have the Cilium data plane support the Container Network Observability and Container Network Security features in Kubernetes version 1.29 and later.

```
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure you replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--location eastus \
--max-pods 250 \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--node-count 2 \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--kubernetes-version 1.33 \
--enable-acns
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--enable-acns`

flag updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. The features include [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability)and

[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security).

Note

Only clusters that have the Cilium data plane support the Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


Next, get your cluster credentials by using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command:

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


### Install the Hubble CLI

Install the Hubble CLI to access the data it collects. Run the following commands:

```
# Set environment variables
export HUBBLE_VERSION=v1.16.3
export HUBBLE_ARCH=amd64
#Install the Hubble CLI
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "aarch64" ]; then HUBBLE_ARCH=arm64; fi
curl -L --fail --remote-name-all https://github.com/cilium/hubble/releases/download/$HUBBLE_VERSION/hubble-linux-${HUBBLE_ARCH}.tar.gz{,.sha256sum}
sha256sum --check hubble-linux-${HUBBLE_ARCH}.tar.gz.sha256sum
sudo tar xzvfC hubble-linux-${HUBBLE_ARCH}.tar.gz /usr/local/bin
rm hubble-linux-${HUBBLE_ARCH}.tar.gz{,.sha256sum}
```


### Visualize the Hubble flows

Make sure that the Hubble pods are running:

`kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system -l k8s-app=hubble-relay`

Your output should look similar to the following example:

`hubble-relay-7ddd887cdb-h6khj 1/1 Running 0 23h`

Port-forward the Hubble Relay server:

`kubectl port-forward -n kube-system svc/hubble-relay --address 127.0.0.1 4245:443`

Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures the security of the Hubble Relay server. To enable the Hubble client to retrieve flows, you must get the appropriate certificates and configure the client with them. Apply the certificates by using the following commands:

`#!/usr/bin/env bash set -euo pipefail set -x # Directory where certificates will be stored CERT_DIR="$(pwd)/.certs" mkdir -p "$CERT_DIR" declare -A CERT_FILES=( ["tls.crt"]="tls-client-cert-file" ["tls.key"]="tls-client-key-file" ["ca.crt"]="tls-ca-cert-files" ) for FILE in "${!CERT_FILES[@]}"; do KEY="${CERT_FILES[$FILE]}" JSONPATH="{.data['${FILE//./\\.}']}" # Retrieve the secret and decode it kubectl get secret hubble-relay-client-certs -n kube-system \ -o jsonpath="${JSONPATH}" | \ base64 -d > "$CERT_DIR/$FILE" # Set the appropriate hubble CLI config hubble config set "$KEY" "$CERT_DIR/$FILE" done hubble config set tls true hubble config set tls-server-name instance.hubble-relay.cilium.io`

Confirm that the secrets were generated:

`kubectl get secrets -n kube-system | grep hubble-`

Your output should look similar to the following example:

`kube-system hubble-relay-client-certs kubernetes.io/tls 3 9d kube-system hubble-relay-server-certs kubernetes.io/tls 3 9d kube-system hubble-server-certs kubernetes.io/tls 3 9d`

Verify that the Hubble Relay pod is running:

`hubble observe --pod hubble-relay-7ddd887cdb-h6khj`


### Visualize by using the Hubble UI

To use the Hubble UI, save the following script in the

`hubble-ui.yaml`

file:`apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: hubble-ui namespace: kube-system --- kind: ClusterRole apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: hubble-ui labels: app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retina rules: - apiGroups: - networking.k8s.io resources: - networkpolicies verbs: - get - list - watch - apiGroups: - "" resources: - componentstatuses - endpoints - namespaces - nodes - pods - services verbs: - get - list - watch - apiGroups: - apiextensions.k8s.io resources: - customresourcedefinitions verbs: - get - list - watch - apiGroups: - cilium.io resources: - "*" verbs: - get - list - watch --- apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: hubble-ui labels: app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retina roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: hubble-ui subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: hubble-ui namespace: kube-system --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: hubble-ui-nginx namespace: kube-system data: nginx.conf: | server { listen 8081; server_name localhost; root /app; index index.html; client_max_body_size 1G; location / { proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; # CORS add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS"; add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *; add_header Access-Control-Max-Age 1728000; add_header Access-Control-Expose-Headers content-length,grpc-status,grpc-message; add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers range,keep-alive,user-agent,cache-control,content-type,content-transfer-encoding,x-accept-content-transfer-encoding,x-accept-response-streaming,x-user-agent,x-grpc-web,grpc-timeout; if ($request_method = OPTIONS) { return 204; } # /CORS location /api { proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_pass_request_headers on; proxy_hide_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090; } location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html /index.html; } # Liveness probe location /healthz { access_log off; add_header Content-Type text/plain; return 200 'ok'; } } } --- kind: Deployment apiVersion: apps/v1 metadata: name: hubble-ui namespace: kube-system labels: k8s-app: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/name: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retina spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: k8s-app: hubble-ui template: metadata: labels: k8s-app: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/name: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retina spec: serviceAccountName: hubble-ui automountServiceAccountToken: true containers: - name: frontend image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/cilium/hubble-ui:v0.12.2 imagePullPolicy: Always ports: - name: http containerPort: 8081 livenessProbe: httpGet: path: /healthz port: 8081 readinessProbe: httpGet: path: / port: 8081 resources: {} volumeMounts: - name: hubble-ui-nginx-conf mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf subPath: nginx.conf - name: tmp-dir mountPath: /tmp terminationMessagePolicy: FallbackToLogsOnError securityContext: {} - name: backend image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/cilium/hubble-ui-backend:v0.12.2 imagePullPolicy: Always env: - name: EVENTS_SERVER_PORT value: "8090" - name: FLOWS_API_ADDR value: "hubble-relay:443" - name: TLS_TO_RELAY_ENABLED value: "true" - name: TLS_RELAY_SERVER_NAME value: ui.hubble-relay.cilium.io - name: TLS_RELAY_CA_CERT_FILES value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/hubble-relay-ca.crt - name: TLS_RELAY_CLIENT_CERT_FILE value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/client.crt - name: TLS_RELAY_CLIENT_KEY_FILE value: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs/client.key livenessProbe: httpGet: path: /healthz port: 8090 readinessProbe: httpGet: path: /healthz port: 8090 ports: - name: grpc containerPort: 8090 resources: {} volumeMounts: - name: hubble-ui-client-certs mountPath: /var/lib/hubble-ui/certs readOnly: true terminationMessagePolicy: FallbackToLogsOnError securityContext: {} nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/os: linux volumes: - configMap: defaultMode: 420 name: hubble-ui-nginx name: hubble-ui-nginx-conf - emptyDir: {} name: tmp-dir - name: hubble-ui-client-certs projected: defaultMode: 0400 sources: - secret: name: hubble-relay-client-certs items: - key: tls.crt path: client.crt - key: tls.key path: client.key - key: ca.crt path: hubble-relay-ca.crt --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: hubble-ui namespace: kube-system labels: k8s-app: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/name: hubble-ui app.kubernetes.io/part-of: retina spec: type: ClusterIP selector: k8s-app: hubble-ui ports: - name: http port: 80 targetPort: 8081`

Apply the

`hubble-ui.yaml`

manifest to your cluster:`kubectl apply -f hubble-ui.yaml`

Set up port forwarding for the Hubble UI:

`kubectl -n kube-system port-forward svc/hubble-ui 12000:80`

In your web browser, enter

`http://localhost:12000/`

to access the Hubble UI.

### Basic troubleshooting

Advanced Container Networking Services is a prerequisite to turn on the Azure Monitor Agent log collection feature.

Trying to enable the container network flow logs capability on a cluster without enabling Advanced Container Networking Services, for example:

`az aks update -g test-rg -n test-cluster --enable-container-network-logs`

Results in an error message:

`Flow logs requires '--enable-acns', advanced networking to be enabled, and the monitoring addon to be enabled.`

If the cluster Kubernetes version is earlier than version 1.33.0, trying to run

`--enable-container-network-logs`

results in an error message:`The specified orchestrator version %s is not valid. Advanced Networking Flow Logs is only supported on Kubernetes version 1.33.0 or later.`

where

`%s`

is your Kubernetes version.If you try to run

`--enable-container-network-logs`

on a subscription where the Azure Feature Exposure Control (AFEC) flag isn't enabled, an error message appears:`Feature Microsoft.ContainerService/AdvancedNetworkingFlowLogsPreview is not enabled. Please see https://aka.ms/aks/previews for how to enable features.`

If you try to apply a

`ContainerNetworkLog`

custom resource on a cluster where Advanced Container Networking Services isn't enabled, an error message appears:`error: resource mapping not found for <....>": no matches for kind "ContainerNetworkLog" in version "acn.azure.com/v1alpha1"`

Ensure that you install custom resources first.


### Disable container network logs: Stored logs mode on existing cluster

If all custom resources are deleted, flow log collection stops because no filters are defined for collection.

To disable container network log collection by the Azure Monitor Agent, run:

```
az aks update -n $CLUSTER_NAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-container-network-logs
```


## Clean up resources

If you don't plan to use this example application, delete the resources you created in this article by using the [ az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/#az-group-delete) command.

```
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

# Use labels in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

If you have multiple node pools, you may want to add a label during node pool creation. [Kubernetes labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) handle the scheduling rules for nodes. You can add labels to a node pool anytime and apply them to all nodes in the node pool.

In this how-to guide, you learn how to use labels in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Prerequisites

You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create an AKS cluster with a label

You can create an AKS cluster with node labels to set key/value metadata for workload scheduling.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $REGION
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


Create the AKS cluster specifying node labels (e.g., dept=IT, costcenter=9000):

```
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
--node-count 2 \
--nodepool-labels dept=IT costcenter=9000 \
--generate-ssh-keys --location $REGION
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"addonProfiles": {},
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 2,
"enableAutoScaling": null,
"mode": "System",
"name": "nodepool1",
"nodeLabels": {
"costcenter": "9000",
"dept": "IT"
}
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myaksclusterxxx-dns",
"fqdn": "myaksclusterxxx-xxxxxxxx.hcp.eastus2.azmk8s.io",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSClusterxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"name": "myAKSClusterxxx",
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx"
}
```


Verify the labels were set:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --overwrite-existing
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep -e "costcenter=9000" -e "dept=IT"
```


## Create a node pool with a label

You can create an additional node pool with labels for specific scheduling needs.

```
export NODEPOOL_NAME="labelnp"
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
--name $NODEPOOL_NAME \
--node-count 1 \
--labels dept=HR costcenter=5000
```


The following is example output from the [ az aks nodepool list](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-list) command showing the

*labelnp*node pool is

*Creating*nodes with the specified

*nodeLabels*:

```
az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME
```


Results:

```
[
{
"count": 2,
"name": "nodepool1",
"nodeLabels": {
"costcenter": "9000",
"dept": "IT"
}
},
{
"count": 1,
"name": "labelnp",
"nodeLabels": {
"costcenter": "5000",
"dept": "HR"
},
"provisioningState": "Creating"
}
]
```


Verify the labels were set:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep -e "costcenter=5000" -e "dept=HR"
```


## Updating labels on existing node pools

You can update the labels on an existing node pool. Note that updating labels will overwrite the old labels.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
--name $NODEPOOL_NAME \
--labels dept=ACCT costcenter=6000
```


Verify the new labels are set:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep -e "costcenter=6000" -e "dept=ACCT"
```


## Unavailable labels

### Reserved system labels

Since the [2021-08-19 AKS release](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases/tag/2021-08-19), AKS stopped the ability to make changes to AKS reserved labels. Attempting to change these labels results in an error message.

The following labels are AKS reserved labels. *Virtual node usage* specifies if these labels could be a supported system feature on virtual nodes. Some properties that these system features change aren't available on the virtual nodes because they require modifying the host.

- kubernetes.azure.com/
- kubernetes.io/

For more information on reserved prefixes, see [Kubernetes well-known labels, annotations, and taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/).

### Deprecated labels

The following labels are planned for deprecation with the release of [Kubernetes v1.24](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar). You should change any label references to the recommended substitute.

| Label | Recommended substitute | Maintainer |
|---|---|---|
| failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region | topology.kubernetes.io/region |

# Configure Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Open-source Istio uses [MeshConfig](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/) to define mesh-wide settings for the Istio service mesh. Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS builds on top of MeshConfig and classifies different properties as supported, allowed, and blocked.

This article walks through how to configure Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service and the support policy applicable for such configuration.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you followed the [documentation](istio-deploy-addon) to enable the Istio add-on on an AKS cluster.

## Set up configuration on cluster

Find out which revision of Istio is deployed on the cluster:

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(head -c 3 /dev/urandom | xxd -p) export CLUSTER="my-aks-cluster" export RESOURCE_GROUP="my-aks-rg$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks show --name $CLUSTER --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query 'serviceMeshProfile' --output json`

Results:

`{ "istio": { "certificateAuthority": null, "components": { "egressGateways": null, "ingressGateways": null }, "revisions": [ "asm-1-24" ] }, "mode": "Istio" }`

This command shows the Istio service mesh profile, including the revision(s) currently deployed on your AKS cluster.

Create a ConfigMap with the name

`istio-shared-configmap-<asm-revision>`

in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace. For example, if your cluster is running asm-1-24 revision of mesh, then the ConfigMap needs to be named as`istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24`

. Mesh configuration has to be provided within the data section under mesh.Example:

`cat <<EOF > istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24 namespace: aks-istio-system data: mesh: |- accessLogFile: /dev/stdout defaultConfig: holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts: true EOF kubectl apply -f istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24.yaml`

Results:

`configmap/istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24 created`

The values under

`defaultConfig`

are mesh-wide settings applied for Envoy sidecar proxy.

Caution

A default ConfigMap (for example, `istio-asm-1-24`

for revision asm-1-24) is created in `aks-istio-system`

namespace on the cluster when the Istio add-on is enabled. However, this default ConfigMap gets reconciled by the managed Istio add-on and thus users should NOT directly edit this ConfigMap. Instead users should create a revision specific Istio shared ConfigMap (for example `istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24`

for revision asm-1-24) in the aks-istio-system namespace, and then the Istio control plane will merge this with the default ConfigMap, with the default settings taking precedence.

### Mesh configuration and upgrades

When you're performing [canary upgrade for Istio](istio-upgrade), you need to create a separate ConfigMap for the new revision in the `aks-istio-system`

namespace **before initiating the canary upgrade**. This way the configuration is available when the new revision's control plane is deployed on cluster. For example, if you're upgrading the mesh from asm-1-24 to asm-1-25, you need to copy changes over from `istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24`

to create a new ConfigMap called `istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-25`

in the `aks-istio-system`

namespace.

After the upgrade is completed or rolled back, you can delete the ConfigMap of the revision that was removed from the cluster.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked MeshConfig values

Fields in `MeshConfig`

are classified as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

. To learn more about these categories, see the [support policy](istio-support-policy#allowed-supported-and-blocked-customizations) for Istio add-on features and configuration options.

Mesh configuration and the list of allowed/supported fields are revision specific to account for fields being added/removed across revisions. The full list of allowed fields and the supported/unsupported ones within the allowed list is provided in the below table. When new mesh revision is made available, any changes to allowed and supported classification of the fields is noted in this table.

### MeshConfig

Fields present in [open source MeshConfig reference documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/) that are not covered in the following table are blocked. For example, `configSources`

is blocked.

**Support scope of configurations:** Mesh configuration allows for extension providers such as self-managed instances of Zipkin or Apache Skywalking to be configured with the Istio add-on. However, these extension providers are outside the support scope of the Istio add-on. Any issues associated with extension tools are outside the support boundary of the Istio add-on.

## Common errors and troubleshooting tips

- Ensure that the MeshConfig is indented with spaces instead of tabs.
- Ensure that you're only editing the revision specific shared ConfigMap (for example
`istio-shared-configmap-asm-1-24`

) and not trying to edit the default ConfigMap (for example`istio-asm-1-24`

). - The ConfigMap must follow the name
`istio-shared-configmap-<asm-revision>`

and be in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace. - Ensure that all MeshConfig fields are spelled correctly. If they're unrecognized or if they aren't part of the allowed list, admission control denies such configurations.
- When performing canary upgrades,
[check your revision specific ConfigMaps](#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades)to ensure configurations exist for the revisions deployed on your cluster. - Certain
`MeshConfig`

options such as accessLogging may increase Envoy's resource consumption, and disabling some of these settings may mitigate Istio data plane resource utilization. It's also advisable to use the`discoverySelectors`

field in the MeshConfig to help alleviate memory consumption for Istiod and Envoy. - If the
`concurrency`

field in the MeshConfig is misconfigured and set to zero, it causes Envoy to use up all CPU cores. Instead if this field is unset, number of worker threads to run is automatically determined based on CPU requests/limits. [Pod and sidecar race conditions](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/injection/#pod-or-containers-start-with-network-issues-if-istio-proxy-is-not-ready)in which the application starts before Envoy can be mitigated using the`holdApplicationUntilProxyStarts`

field in the MeshConfig.

# Support policies for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes technical support policies and limitations for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It also details agent node management, managed control plane components, third-party open-source components, and security or patch management.

## Service updates and releases

- For release information, see
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - For information on preview features, see the
[AKS roadmap](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/projects/1).

## Managed features in AKS

Base infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud components, such as compute or networking components, allow you access to low-level controls and customization options. By contrast, AKS provides a turnkey Kubernetes deployment that gives you a common set of configurations and capabilities you need for your cluster. As an AKS user, you have limited customization and deployment options. In exchange, you don't need to worry about or manage Kubernetes clusters directly.

With AKS, you get a fully managed *control plane*. The control plane contains all of the components and services you need to operate and deliver Kubernetes clusters to end users. Microsoft maintains and operates all Kubernetes components.

Microsoft manages and monitors the following components through the control plane:

- Kubelet or Kubernetes API servers
- Etcd or a compatible key-value store, providing Quality of Service (QoS), scalability, and runtime
- DNS services (for example, kube-dns or CoreDNS)
- Kubernetes proxy or networking, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is used - Any other
[add-ons](integrations#add-ons)or system component running in the kube-system namespace.

AKS isn't a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution. Some components, such as agent nodes, have *shared responsibility*, where you must help maintain the AKS cluster. User input is required, for example, to apply an agent node operating system (OS) security patch.

The services are *managed* in the sense that Microsoft and the AKS team deploys, operates, and is responsible for service availability and functionality. Customers can't alter these managed components. Microsoft limits customization to ensure a consistent and scalable user experience.

## Shared responsibility

When a cluster is created, you define the Kubernetes agent nodes that AKS creates. Your workloads are executed on these nodes.

Because your agent nodes execute private code and store sensitive data, Microsoft Support can access them only in a limited way. Microsoft Support can't sign in to, execute commands in, or view logs for these nodes without your express permission or assistance.

Any modification made directly to the agent nodes using any one of the IaaS APIs renders the cluster unsupportable. Any modification applied to the agent nodes must be done using kubernetes-native mechanisms such as `Daemon Sets`

.

Similarly, while you might add any metadata to the cluster and nodes, such as tags and labels, changing any of the system created metadata renders the cluster unsupported.

## AKS support coverage

### Supported scenarios

Microsoft provides technical support for the following examples:

- Connectivity to all Kubernetes components that the Kubernetes service provides and supports, such as the API server.
- Management, uptime, QoS, and operations of Kubernetes control plane services (For example, Kubernetes control plane, API server, etcd, and coreDNS).
- Etcd data store. Support includes automated, transparent backups of all etcd data every 30 minutes for disaster planning and cluster state restoration. These backups aren't directly available to you or anyone else. They ensure data reliability and consistency. On-demand rollback or restore isn't supported as a feature.
- Any integration points in the Azure cloud provider driver for Kubernetes. These include integrations into other Azure services such as load balancers, persistent volumes, or networking (Kubernetes and Azure CNI, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is in use). - Questions or issues about customization of control plane components such as the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and coreDNS.
- Issues about networking, such as Azure CNI, kubenet, or other network access and functionality issues, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is in use. Issues could include DNS resolution, packet loss, routing, and so on. Microsoft supports various networking scenarios:- Kubenet and Azure CNI using managed VNETs or with custom (bring your own) subnets.
- Connectivity to other Azure services and applications
- Microsoft-managed ingress controllers or load balancer configurations
- Network performance and latency
- Microsoft-managed
[network policies](use-network-policies#differences-between-network-policy-engines-cilium-azure-npm-and-calico)components and functionalities


Note

Any cluster actions taken by Microsoft/AKS are made with your consent under a built-in Kubernetes role `aks-service`

and built-in role binding `aks-service-rolebinding`

. This role enables AKS to troubleshoot and diagnose cluster issues, but can't modify permissions nor create roles or role bindings, or other high privilege actions. Role access is only enabled under active support tickets with just-in-time (JIT) access.

### Unsupported scenarios

Microsoft doesn't provide technical support for the following scenarios:

Questions about how to use Kubernetes. For example, Microsoft Support doesn't provide advice on how to create custom ingress controllers, use application workloads, or apply third-party or open-source software packages or tools.

Note

Microsoft Support can advise on AKS cluster functionality, customization, and tuning (for example, Kubernetes operations issues and procedures).

Third-party open-source projects that aren't provided as part of the Kubernetes control plane or deployed with AKS clusters. These projects might include Istio, Helm, Envoy, or others.

Note

Microsoft can provide best-effort support for third-party open-source projects such as Helm. Where the third-party open-source tool integrates with the Kubernetes Azure cloud provider or other AKS-specific bugs, Microsoft supports examples and applications from Microsoft documentation.

Third-party closed-source software. This software can include security scanning tools and networking devices or software.

Configuring or troubleshooting application-specific code or behavior of third-party applications or tools running within the AKS cluster. This includes application deployment issues not related to the AKS platform itself.

Issuance, renewal, or management of certificates for applications running on AKS.

Network customizations other than the ones listed in the

[AKS documentation](./). For example, Microsoft Support can't configure devices or virtual appliances meant to provide[outbound traffic](outbound-rules-control-egress)for the AKS cluster, such as VPNs or firewalls.Note

On a best-effort basis, Microsoft Support might advise on the

[configuration needed](outbound-rules-control-egress)for Azure Firewall, but not for other third-party devices.Custom or third-party CNI plugins used in

[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)mode.Configuring or troubleshooting non-Microsoft-managed network policies. While using network policies is supported, Microsoft Support can't investigate issues stemming from custom network policy configurations.

Configuring or troubleshooting non-Microsoft-managed ingress controllers, such as nginx, kong, traefik, etc. This includes addressing functionality issues that arise after AKS-specific operations, like an ingress controller ceasing to work following a Kubernetes version upgrade. Such issues might stem from incompatibilities between the ingress controller version and the new Kubernetes version. For a fully supported option, consider leveraging a

[Microsoft-managed ingress controller option](concepts-network-ingress#compare-ingress-options).Configuring or troubleshooting DaemonSets (including scripts) used to customize node configurations. Although using DaemonSets is the recommended approach to tune, modify, or install third-party software on cluster agent nodes when

[configuration file parameters](custom-node-configuration)are insufficient, Microsoft Support can't troubleshoot issues arising from the custom scripts used in DaemonSets due to their custom nature.Stand-by and proactive scenarios. Microsoft Support provides reactive support to help solve active issues in a timely and professional manner. However, standby or proactive support to help you eliminate operational risks, increase availability, and optimize performance aren't covered.

[Eligible customers](https://www.microsoft.com/unifiedsupport)can contact their account team to get nominated for[Azure Event Management service](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/proactively-plan-for-your-critical-event-in-azure-with-enhanced-support-and-engineering-services/). It's a paid service delivered by Microsoft support engineers that includes a proactive solution risk assessment and coverage during the event.Vulnerabilities / CVEs with a vendor fix that is less than 30 days old. As long as you're running the updated VHD, you shouldn't be running any container image vulnerabilities / CVEs with a vendor fix that is over 30 days old. It's customer responsibility to update the VHD and provide filtered lists to Microsoft support. Once you updated your VHD, it is customer responsibility to filter the vulnerabilities / CVEs report and provide a list only with vulnerabilities/CVEs with a vendor fix that is over 30 days old. If that will be the case, Microsoft support will make sure to work internally and address components with a vendor fix released more than 30 days ago. Additionally, Microsoft provide vulnerability / CVE-related support only for Microsoft-managed components (i.e., AKS node images, managed container images for applications that get deploy during cluster creation or via the installation of a managed add-on). For more details about vulnerability management for AKS, visit

[this page](concepts-vulnerability-management).Custom code samples or scripts. While Microsoft Support

*can*provide small code samples and reviews of small code samples within a support case to demonstrate how to use features of a Microsoft product, Microsoft Support*can't*provide custom code samples that are specific to your environment or application.

## AKS support coverage for agent nodes

### Microsoft responsibilities for AKS agent nodes

Microsoft and you share responsibility for Kubernetes agent nodes where:

- The base OS image has required additions (such as monitoring and networking agents).
- The agent nodes receive OS patches automatically.
- Issues with the Kubernetes control plane components that run on the agent nodes are automatically remediated. These components include the below:
`Kube-proxy`

- Networking tunnels that provide communication paths to the Kubernetes master components
`Kubelet`

`containerd`


Note

If an agent node isn't operational, AKS might restart individual components or the entire agent node. These restart operations are automated and provide auto-remediation for common issues. If you want to know more about the auto-remediation mechanisms, see [Node Auto-Repair](node-auto-repair)

### Customer responsibilities for AKS agent nodes

Microsoft provides patches and new images for your image nodes weekly. To keep your agent node OS and runtime components up to date, you should apply these patches and updates regularly either manually or automatically. For more information, see:

Similarly, AKS regularly releases new Kubernetes patches and minor versions. These updates can contain security or functionality improvements to Kubernetes. You're responsible to keep your clusters' Kubernetes version updated and according to the [AKS Kubernetes support version policy](supported-kubernetes-versions).

#### User customization of agent nodes

Note

AKS agent nodes appear in the Azure portal as standard Azure IaaS resources. However, these virtual machines are deployed into a custom Azure resource group (prefixed with MC_*). You can't change the base OS image or make any direct customizations to these nodes using the IaaS APIs or resources. Any custom changes that aren't performed from the AKS API won't persist through an upgrade, scale, update or reboot. Also, any change to the nodes' extensions like the **CustomScriptExtension** can lead to unexpected behavior and should be prohibited.
Avoid performing changes to the agent nodes unless Microsoft Support directs you to make changes.

AKS manages the lifecycle and operations of agent nodes on your behalf and modifying the IaaS resources associated with the agent nodes is **not supported**. An example of an unsupported operation is customizing a node pool virtual machine scale set by manually changing configurations in the Azure portal or from the API.

For workload-specific configurations or packages, AKS recommends using [Kubernetes daemon sets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

Using Kubernetes privileged `daemon sets`

and init containers enables you to tune/modify or install third party software on cluster agent nodes. Examples of such customizations include adding custom security scanning software or updating sysctl settings.

While this path is recommended if the above requirements apply, AKS engineering and support can't help troubleshoot or diagnose modifications that render the node unavailable due to a custom deployed `daemon set`

.

### Security issues and patching

If a security flaw is found in one or more of the managed components of AKS, the AKS team patches all affected clusters to mitigate the issue. Alternatively, the AKS team provides you with upgrade guidance.

For agent nodes affected by a security flaw, Microsoft notifies you with details on the impact and the steps to fix or mitigate the security issue.

### Node maintenance and access

Although you can sign in to and change agent nodes, doing this operation is discouraged because changes can make a cluster unsupportable.

## Network ports, access, and NSGs

You might only customize the NSGs on custom subnets. You might not customize NSGs on managed subnets or at the NIC level of the agent nodes. AKS has egress requirements to specific endpoints, to control egress and ensure the necessary connectivity, see [limit egress traffic](limit-egress-traffic). For ingress, the requirements are based on the applications you have deployed to cluster.

## Stopped, deallocated, and Not Ready nodes

If you don't need your AKS workloads to run continuously, you can [stop the AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster#stop-an-aks-cluster), which stops all nodepools and the control plane. You can start it again when needed. When you stop a cluster using the `az aks stop`

command, the cluster state is preserved for up to 12 months. After 12 months, the cluster state and all of its resources are deleted.

Manually deallocating all cluster nodes from the IaaS APIs, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal isn't supported to stop an AKS cluster or nodepool. The cluster will be considered out of support and stopped by AKS after 30 days. The clusters are then subject to the same 12 month preservation policy as a correctly stopped cluster.

Clusters with zero **Ready** nodes (or all **Not Ready**) and zero **Running** VMs will be stopped after 30 days.

AKS reserves the right to archive control planes that have been configured out of support guidelines for extended periods equal to and beyond 30 days. AKS maintains backups of cluster etcd metadata and can readily reallocate the cluster. This reallocation is initiated by any PUT operation bringing the cluster back into support, such as an upgrade or scale to active agent nodes.

All clusters in a suspended subscription will be stopped immediately and deleted after 90 days. All clusters in a deleted subscription will be deleted immediately.

## Unsupported alpha and beta Kubernetes features

AKS only supports stable and beta features within the upstream Kubernetes project. Unless otherwise documented, AKS doesn't support any alpha feature that is available in the upstream Kubernetes project.

## Preview features or feature flags

For features and functionality that requires extended testing and user feedback, Microsoft releases new preview features or features behind a feature flag. Consider these features as prerelease or beta features.

Preview features or feature-flag features aren't meant for production. Ongoing changes in APIs and behavior, bug fixes, and other changes can result in unstable clusters and downtime.

Features in public preview fall under **best effort** support, as these features are in preview and aren't meant for production. The AKS technical support teams provides support during business hours only. For more information, see [Azure Support FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

## Upstream bugs and issues

Given the speed of development in the upstream Kubernetes project, bugs invariably arise. Some of these bugs can't be patched or worked around within the AKS system. Instead, bug fixes require larger patches to upstream projects (such as Kubernetes, node or agent operating systems, and kernel). For components that Microsoft owns (such as the Azure cloud provider), AKS and Azure personnel are committed to fixing issues upstream in the community.

When the root cause of a technical support issue is due to one or more upstream bugs, AKS support and engineering teams will:

Identify and link the upstream bugs with any supporting details to help explain why this issue affects your cluster or workload. Customers receive links to the required repositories so they can watch the issues and see when a new release will provide fixes.

Provide potential workarounds or mitigation. If the issue can be mitigated, a

[known issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aknown-issue)is filed in the AKS repository. The known-issue filing explains:- The issue, including links to upstream bugs.
- The workaround and details about an upgrade or another persistence of the solution.
- Rough timelines for the issue's inclusion, based on the upstream release cadence.
