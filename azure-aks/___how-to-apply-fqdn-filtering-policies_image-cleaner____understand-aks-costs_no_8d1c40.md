# Set up FQDN filtering feature for Container Network Security in Advanced Container Networking Services

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to set up Advanced Container Networking Services with Container Network Security feature in AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.71.0. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you can't use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempt to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods might exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP, HTTPS, Kafka, and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images might encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) enabled.

The `az aks create`

command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`

, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering. To learn more visit[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security).

```
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--location eastus \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--node-count 2 \
--enable-acns
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,

`--enable-acns`

, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features which includes [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability)and the

[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security)feature

Note

Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


## Get cluster credentials

Get your cluster credentials using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Test connectivity with a policy

This section demonstrates how to observe a policy being enforced through the Cilium Agent. A DNS request is made to an allowed FQDN and another case where it's blocked.

Create a file named `demo-policy.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:

Note

The field `spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`

is **mandatory** when using to FQDNs in a policy. This section tells Cilium to inspect DNS queries and match them against specified patterns. Without this section, Cilium only allows the DNS traffic and not inspect its contents to learn which IPs are associated with the FQDNs. As a result, connections to those IPs (i.e., non-DNS traffic) are blocked because Cilium can't associate them with the allowed domain.

Make sure to check the [limitations](#limitations) section first.

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


Specify the name of your YAML manifest and apply it by using [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply]:

```
kubectl create ns demo
kubectl apply -f demo-policy.yaml -n demo
```


### Create a demo pod

Create a `client`

pod running Bash:

```
kubectl run -it client -n demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.43 --labels="app=demo-container" --command -- bash
```


A shell with utilities for testing FQDN should open with the following output:

```
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
bash-5.0#
```


In a separate window, run the following command to get the node of the running pod.

```
kubectl get po -n demo --sort-by="{spec.nodeName}" -o wide
```


The output should look similar to the following example:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES
client 1/1 Running 0 5m50s 192.168.0.139 aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001 <none> <none>
```


The pod is running on a node named `aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001`

. Obtain the Cilium Agent instance running on that node:

```
kubectl get po -n kube-system -o wide --field-selector spec.nodeName="aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001" | grep "cilium"
```


The expected `cilium-s4x24`

should be in the output.

```
cilium-s4x24 1/1 Running 0 47m 10.224.0.4 aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001 <none> <none>
```


### Inspect a Cilium Agent

Use the `cilium`

CLI to monitor traffic being blocked.

```
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system cilium-s4x24 -- sh
```


```
Defaulted container "cilium-agent" out of: cilium-agent, install-cni-binaries (init), mount-cgroup (init), apply-sysctl-overwrites (init), mount-bpf-fs (init), clean-cilium-state (init), block-wireserver (init)
#
```


Inside this shell, run `cilium monitor -t drop`

:

```
Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Press Ctrl-C to quit
time="2024-10-08T17:48:27Z" level=info msg="Initializing dissection cache..." subsys=monitor
```


### Verify policy

From the first shell, create a request to the allowed FQDN, `*.bing.com`

, as specified by the policy. This request should succeed and allowed by the agent.

```
./agnhost connect www.bing.com:80
```


Then create another request to an FQDN expected to be blocked:

```
./agnhost connect www.example.com:80
```


Cilium Agent blocked the request with the output:

```
xx drop (Policy denied) flow 0xfddd76f6 to endpoint 0, ifindex 29, file bpf_lxc.c:1274, , identity 48447->world: 192.168.0.149:45830 -> 93.184.215.14:80 tcp SYN
```


### Supported by CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy(CCNP)

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

supports FQDN filtering.

Note

[Namespace specific information](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/kubernetes/#namespace-specific-information) such as `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`

is only supported in cluster-wide policies.

```
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-bing-fqdn
spec:
endpointSelector: {} # Applies to all pods in the cluster
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


## Clean up resources

If you don't plan on using this application, delete the other resources you created in this article using the [ az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/#az-group-delete) command.

```

# Use Image Cleaner to clean up vulnerable stale images on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

It's common to use pipelines to build and deploy images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. While great for image creation, this process often doesn't account for the stale images left behind and can lead to image bloat on cluster nodes. These images might contain vulnerabilities, which might create security issues. To remove security risks in your clusters, you can clean these unreferenced images. Manually cleaning images can be time intensive. Image Cleaner performs automatic image identification and removal, which mitigates the risk of stale images and reduces the time required to clean them up.

Note

Image Cleaner is a feature based on [Eraser](https://eraser-dev.github.io/eraser).
On an AKS cluster, the feature name and property name is `Image Cleaner`

, while the relevant Image Cleaner pods' names contain `Eraser`

.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.49.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find your version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

Image Cleaner doesn't yet support Windows node pools or AKS virtual nodes.

## How Image Cleaner works

After you enable Image Cleaner, there will be a controller manager pod named `eraser-controller-manager`

deployed to your cluster.


With Image Cleaner, you can choose between manual and automatic mode and the following configuration options:

## Configuration options

| Name | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
`--enable-image-cleaner` |
Enable the Image Cleaner feature for an AKS cluster | Yes, unless disable is specified |
`--disable-image-cleaner` |
Disable the Image Cleaner feature for an AKS cluster | Yes, unless enable is specified |
`--image-cleaner-interval-hours` |
This parameter determines the interval time (in hours) Image Cleaner uses to run. The default value for Azure CLI is one week, the minimum value is 24 hours and the maximum is three months. | Not required for Azure CLI, required for ARM template or other clients |

### Automatic mode

Once `eraser-controller-manager`

is deployed, the following steps will be taken automatically:

- It immediately starts the cleanup process and creates
`eraser-aks-xxxxx`

worker pods for each node. - There are three containers in each worker pod:
- A
**collector**, which collects unused images. - A
**trivy-scanner**, which leverages[trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)to scan image vulnerabilities. - A
**remover**, which removes unused images with vulnerabilities.

- A
- After the cleanup process completes, the worker pod is deleted and the next scheduled cleanup happens according to the
`--image-cleaner-interval-hours`

you define.

### Manual mode

You can manually trigger the cleanup by defining a CRD object,`ImageList`

. This triggers the `eraser-contoller-manager`

to create `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

worker pods for each node and complete the manual removal process.

Note

After disabling Image Cleaner, the old configuration still exists. This means if you enable the feature again without explicitly passing configuration, the existing value is used instead of the default.

## Enable Image Cleaner on your AKS cluster

### Enable Image Cleaner on a new cluster

Enable Image Cleaner on a new AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-image-cleaner`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-image-cleaner \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable Image Cleaner on an existing cluster

Enable Image Cleaner on an existing AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-image-cleaner`


### Update the Image Cleaner interval on a new or existing cluster

Update the Image Cleaner interval on a new or existing AKS cluster using the

`--image-cleaner-interval-hours`

parameter.`# Create a new cluster with specifying the interval az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-image-cleaner \ --image-cleaner-interval-hours 48 \ --generate-ssh-keys # Update the interval on an existing cluster az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-image-cleaner \ --image-cleaner-interval-hours 48`


## Manually remove images using Image Cleaner

Important

The `name`

must be set to `imagelist`

.

Manually remove an image using the following

`kubectl apply`

command. This example removes the`docker.io/library/alpine:3.7.3`

image if it's unused.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: eraser.sh/v1 kind: ImageList metadata: name: imagelist spec: images: - docker.io/library/alpine:3.7.3 EOF`


The manual cleanup is a one-time operation and is only triggered when a new `imagelist`

is created or changes are made to the existing `imagelist`

. After the image is deleted, the `imagelist`

won't be deleted automatically.

If you need to trigger another manual cleanup, you have to create a new `imagelist`

or make changes to an existing one. If you want to remove the same image again, you need to create a new `imagelist`

.

### Delete an existing ImageList and create a new one

Delete the old

`imagelist`

using the`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete ImageList imagelist`

Create a new

`imagelist`

with the same image name. The following example uses the same image as the[previous example](#manually-remove-images-using-image-cleaner).`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: eraser.sh/v1 kind: ImageList metadata: name: imagelist spec: images: - docker.io/library/alpine:3.7.3 EOF`


### Modify an existing ImageList

Modify the existing

`imagelist`

using the`kubectl edit`

command.`kubectl edit ImageList imagelist # Add a new image to the list apiVersion: eraser.sh/v1 kind: ImageList metadata: name: imagelist spec: images: docker.io/library/python:alpine3.18`


When using manual mode, the `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

pod deletes within 10 minutes after work completion.

## Image exclusion list

Images specified in the exclusion list aren't removed from the cluster. Image Cleaner supports system and user-defined exclusion lists. It's not supported to edit the system exclusion list.

### Check the system exclusion list

Check the system exclusion list using the following

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get -n kube-system configmap eraser-system-exclusion -o yaml`


### Create a user-defined exclusion list

Create a sample JSON file to contain excluded images.

`cat > sample.json <<EOF {"excluded": ["excluded-image-name"]} EOF`

Create a

`configmap`

using the sample JSON file using the following`kubectl create`

and`kubectl label`

command.`kubectl create configmap excluded --from-file=sample.json --namespace=kube-system kubectl label configmap excluded eraser.sh/exclude.list=true -n kube-system`


## Disable Image Cleaner

Disable Image Cleaner on your cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-image-cleaner`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --disable-image-cleaner`


## FAQ

### How can I check which version Image Cleaner is using?

```
kubectl describe configmap -n kube-system eraser-manager-config | grep tag -C 3
```


### Does Image Cleaner support other vulnerability scanners besides trivy-scanner?

No.

### Can I specify vulnerability levels for images to clean?

No. The default settings for vulnerability levels include:

`LOW`

,`MEDIUM`

,`HIGH`

, and`CRITICAL`


You can't customize the default settings.

### How to review images were cleaned up by Image Cleaner?

Image logs are stored in the `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

worker pod. When `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

is alive, you can run the following commands to view deletion logs:

```
kubectl logs -n kube-system <worker-pod-name> -c collector
kubectl logs -n kube-system <worker-pod-name> -c trivy-scanner
kubectl logs -n kube-system <worker-pod-name> -c remover
```


The `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

pod deletes within 10 minutes after work completion. You can follow these steps to enable the [Azure Monitor add-on](monitor-aks) and use the Container Insights pod log table. After that, historical logs will be stored and you can review them even `eraser-aks-xxxxx`

is deleted.

Ensure Azure Monitoring is enabled on your cluster. For detailed steps, see

[Enable Container Insights on AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks#existing-aks-cluster).Logs for the containers running in

`kube-system`

namespace are not collected by default. Remove the`kube-system`

namespace from`exclude_namespaces`

in the configmap and apply the config map to enable collection of these logs. See[Configure Container insights data collection](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-data-collection-configure#configure-data-collection-using-configmap)for details.Get the Log Analytics resource ID using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster`

After a few minutes, the command returns JSON-formatted information about the solution, including the workspace resource ID:

`"addonProfiles": { "omsagent": { "config": { "logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceID": "/subscriptions/<WorkspaceSubscription>/resourceGroups/<DefaultWorkspaceRG>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<defaultWorkspaceName>" }, "enabled": true } }`

In the Azure portal, search for the workspace resource ID, then select

**Logs**.Copy one of the following queries and paste into the query window.

Use the following query if your cluster is using the

[ContainerLogV2 schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-logs-schema). If you're still using`ContainerLog`

, you should upgrade to ContainerlogV2.`ContainerLogV2 | where PodName startswith "eraser-aks-" and PodNamespace == "kube-system" | project TimeGenerated, PodName, LogMessage, LogSource`

If you want continue to use

`ContainerLog`

, use the following query instead:`let startTimestamp = ago(1h); KubePodInventory | where TimeGenerated > startTimestamp | project ContainerID, PodName=Name, Namespace | where PodName startswith "eraser-aks-" and Namespace == "kube-system" | distinct ContainerID, PodName | join ( ContainerLog | where TimeGenerated > startTimestamp ) on ContainerID // at this point before the next pipe, columns from both tables are available to be "projected". Due to both // tables having a "Name" column, we assign an alias as PodName to one column which we actually want | project TimeGenerated, PodName, LogEntry, LogEntrySource | summarize by TimeGenerated, LogEntry | order by TimeGenerated desc`


Select

**Run**. Any deleted image logs appear in the**Results**area.

# Deploy a fully managed resource group using node resource group lockdown in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS deploys infrastructure into your subscription for connecting to and running your applications. Changes made directly to resources in the [node resource group](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-resource-group) can affect cluster operations or cause future issues. For example, scaling, storage, or network configurations should be made through the Kubernetes API and not directly on these resources.

To prevent changes from being made to the node resource group, you can apply a deny assignment and block users from modifying resources created as part of the AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you need the following resources installed and configured:

- The Azure CLI version 2.44.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the current version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create an AKS cluster with node resource group lockdown

Create a cluster with node resource group lockdown using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level`

flag set to `ReadOnly`

. This configuration allows you to view the resources but not modify them.```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level ReadOnly \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Update an existing cluster with node resource group lockdown

Update an existing cluster with node resource group lockdown using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level`

flag set to `ReadOnly`

. This configuration allows you to view the resources but not modify them.```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --nrg-lockdown-restriction-level ReadOnly
```


## Remove node resource group lockdown from a cluster

Remove node resource group lockdown from an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--nrg-restriction-level`

flag set to `Unrestricted`

. This configuration allows you to view and modify the resources.```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --nrg-lockdown-restriction-level Unrestricted
```

# Create a node auto-provisioning (NAP) cluster in a custom virtual network in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create a virtual network (VNet) and subnet, create a managed identity with permissions to access the VNet, and create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in your custom VNet with node auto-provisioning (NAP) enabled.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version
`2.76.0`

or later. To find the version, run`az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). - Read the
[Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning)article, which details[how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work). - Read the
[Overview of networking configurations for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](node-auto-provisioning-networking).

## Limitations

- When creating a NAP cluster in a custom virtual network (VNet), you must use a
[Standard Load Balancer](load-balancer-standard). The Basic Load Balancer isn't supported. - To review other limitations and unsupported features for NAP, see the
[Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features)article.

## Create a virtual network and subnet

Important

When using a custom VNet with NAP keep the following information in mind:

- You must create and delegate an API server subnet to
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same VNet. The minimum supported API server subnet size is*/28*. - All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. However, if you added network security group (NSG) rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, you need to ensure you configure the proper permissions. For more information, see the
[Network security group documentation](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview).

Create a VNet using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`az network vnet create \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --location $LOCATION \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/16`

Create a subnet using the

command and delegate it to`az network vnet subnet create`

`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

.`az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --delegations Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/28`


## Create a managed identity and give it permissions to access the VNet

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location $LOCATION`

Get the principal ID of the managed identity and set it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $IDENTITY_NAME --query principalId -o tsv)`

Assign the

*Network Contributor*role to the managed identity using thecommand.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create \ --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME" \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee $IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID`


## Create an AKS cluster with node auto-provisioning (NAP) in a custom VNet

Create an AKS cluster with NAP enabled in your custom VNet using the

command. Make sure to set the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag to`Auto`

to enable NAP.The following command also sets the

`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

. For more information on networking configurations supported with NAP, see[Configure networking for node auto-provisioning on AKS](node-autoprovision-networking).`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --location $LOCATION \ --assign-identity "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/$IDENTITY_NAME" \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --vnet-subnet-id "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$CUSTOM_VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME" \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

# Provision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service

After you [configure Azure NetApp Files for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files), you can provision Azure NetApp Files volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service.

Azure NetApp Files supports volumes using [NFS](azure-netapp-files-nfs) (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), [SMB](azure-netapp-files-smb), and dual-protocol (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB).

This article shows you how to statically provisioning volumes for dual-protocol access using NFS or SMB.

## Before you begin

## Provision a dual-protocol volume in Azure Kubernetes Service

This section describes how to expose an Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volume statically to Kubernetes. Instructions are provided for both SMB and NFS protocols. You can expose the same volume via SMB to Windows worker nodes and via NFS to Linux worker nodes.

### Create the persistent volume for NFS

Define variables for later usage. Replace *myresourcegroup*, *myaccountname*, *mypool1*, *myvolname* with an appropriate value from your dual-protocol volume.

```
RESOURCE_GROUP="myresourcegroup"
ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME="myaccountname"
POOL_NAME="mypool1"
VOLUME_NAME="myvolname"
```


List the details of your volume using the `az netappfiles volume show`

command.

```
az netappfiles volume show \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \
--pool-name $POOL_NAME \
--volume-name $VOLUME_NAME -o JSON
```


The following output is an example of the above command executed with real values.

```
{
...
"creationToken": "myfilepath2",
...
"mountTargets": [
{
...
"ipAddress": "10.0.0.4",
...
}
],
...
}
```


Create a file named `pv-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Make sure the server matches the output IP address from the previous step, and the path matches the output from `creationToken`

above. The capacity must also match the volume size from Step 2.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
name: pv-nfs
spec:
capacity:
storage: 100Gi
accessModes:
- ReadWriteMany
mountOptions:
- vers=3
nfs:
server: 10.0.0.4
path: /myfilepath2
```


Create the persistent volume using the `kubectl apply`

command:

```
kubectl apply -f pv-nfs.yaml
```


Verify the status of the persistent volume is *Available* by using the `kubectl describe`

command:

```
kubectl describe pv pv-nfs
```


### Create a persistent volume claim for NFS

Create a file named `pvc-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This manifest creates a PVC named `pvc-nfs`

for 100Gi storage and `ReadWriteMany`

access mode, matching the PV you created.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
name: pvc-nfs
spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteMany
storageClassName: ""
resources:
requests:
storage: 100Gi
```


Create the persistent volume claim using the `kubectl apply`

command:

```
kubectl apply -f pvc-nfs.yaml
```


Verify the *Status* of the persistent volume claim is *Bound* by using the `kubectl describe`

command:

```
kubectl describe pvc pvc-nfs
```


### Mount within a pod using NFS

Create a file named `nginx-nfs.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This manifest defines a `nginx`

pod that uses the persistent volume claim.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: nginx-nfs
spec:
containers:
- image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
name: nginx-nfs
command:
- "/bin/sh"
- "-c"
- while true; do echo $(date) >> /mnt/azure/outfile; sleep 1; done
volumeMounts:
- name: disk01
mountPath: /mnt/azure
volumes:
- name: disk01
persistentVolumeClaim:
claimName: pvc-nfs
```


Create the pod using the `kubectl apply`

[kubectl-apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command:

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-nfs.yaml
```


Verify the pod is *Running* by using the `kubectl apply`

command:

```
kubectl describe pod nginx-nfs
```


Verify your volume has been mounted on the pod by using `kubectl exec`

to connect to the pod, and then use `df -h`

to check if the volume is mounted.

```
kubectl exec -it nginx-nfs -- sh
```


```
/ # df -h
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
...
10.0.0.4:/myfilepath2 100T 384K 100T 1% /mnt/azure
...
```


### Create a secret with the domain credentials

- Create a secret on your AKS cluster to access the AD server using the
`kubectl create secret`

command. This secret will be used by the Kubernetes persistent volume to access the Azure NetApp Files SMB volume. Use the following command to create the secret, replacing `USERNAME`

with your username, `PASSWORD`

with your password, and `DOMAIN_NAME`

with your Active Directory domain name.

```
kubectl create secret generic smbcreds --from-literal=username=USERNAME --from-literal=password="PASSWORD" --from-literal=domain='DOMAIN_NAME'
```


- To verify the secret has been created, run the
`kubectl get`

command.

```
kubectl get secret
```


```
NAME TYPE DATA AGE
smbcreds Opaque 2 20h
```


### Install an SMB CSI driver

You must install a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver to create a Kubernetes SMB `PersistentVolume`

.

Install the SMB CSI driver on your cluster using helm. Be sure to set the `windows.enabled`

option to `true`

:

```
helm repo add csi-driver-smb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb/master/charts
helm install csi-driver-smb csi-driver-smb/csi-driver-smb --namespace kube-system --version v1.10.0 –-set windows.enabled=true
```


For other methods of installing the SMB CSI Driver, see [Install SMB CSI driver master version on a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb/blob/master/docs/install-csi-driver-master.md).

Verify the `csi-smb`

controller pod is running and each worker node has a pod running using the `kubectl get pods`

command:

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep csi-smb
```


```
csi-smb-controller-68df7b4758-xf2m9 3/3 Running 0 3m46s
csi-smb-node-s6clj 3/3 Running 0 3m47s
csi-smb-node-win-tfxvk 3/3 Running 0 3m47s
```


### Create the persistent volume for SMB

Define variables for later usage. Replace *myresourcegroup*, *myaccountname*, *mypool1*, *myvolname* with an appropriate value from your dual-protocol volume.

```
RESOURCE_GROUP="myresourcegroup"
ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME="myaccountname"
POOL_NAME="mypool1"
VOLUME_NAME="myvolname"
```


List the details of your volume using `az netappfiles volume show`

command.

```
az netappfiles volume show \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \
--pool-name $POOL_NAME \
--volume-name "$VOLUME_NAME -o JSON
```


The following output is an example of the above command executed with real values.

```
{
...
"creationToken": "myvolname",
...
"mountTargets": [
{
...
"
"smbServerFqdn": "ANF-1be3.contoso.com",
...
}
],
...
}
```


Create a file named `pv-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. If necessary, replace `myvolname`

with the `creationToken`

and replace `ANF-1be3.contoso.com\myvolname`

with the value of `smbServerFqdn`

from the previous step. Be sure to include your AD credentials secret along with the namespace where it's located that you created in a prior step.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
name: anf-pv-smb
spec:
storageClassName: ""
capacity:
storage: 100Gi
accessModes:
- ReadWriteMany
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
mountOptions:
- dir_mode=0777
- file_mode=0777
- vers=3.0
csi:
driver: smb.csi.k8s.io
readOnly: false
volumeHandle: myvolname # make sure it's a unique name in the cluster
volumeAttributes:
source: \\ANF-1be3.contoso.com\myvolname
nodeStageSecretRef:
name: smbcreds
namespace: default
```


Create the persistent volume using the `kubectl apply`

command:

```
kubectl apply -f pv-smb.yaml
```


Verify the status of the persistent volume is *Available* using the `kubectl describe`

command:

```
kubectl describe pv anf-pv-smb
```


### Create a persistent volume claim for SMB

Create a file name `pvc-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
name: anf-pvc-smb
spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteMany
volumeName: anf-pv-smb
storageClassName: ""
resources:
requests:
storage: 100Gi
```


Create the persistent volume claim using the `kubectl apply`

command:

```
kubectl apply -f pvc-smb.yaml
```


Verify the status of the persistent volume claim is *Bound* by using the `kubectl describe`

command:

```
kubectl describe pvc anf-pvc-smb
```


### Mount within a pod using SMB

Create a file named `iis-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This file will be used to create an Internet Information Services pod to mount the volume to path `/inetpub/wwwroot`

.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: iis-pod
labels:
app: web
spec:
nodeSelector:
"kubernetes.io/os": windows
volumes:
- name: smb
persistentVolumeClaim:
claimName: anf-pvc-smb
containers:
- name: web
image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore
resources:
limits:
cpu: 1
memory: 800M
ports:
- containerPort: 80
volumeMounts:
- name: smb
mountPath: "/inetpub/wwwroot"
readOnly: false
```


Create the pod using the [kubectl apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply) command:

```
kubectl apply -f iis-smb.yaml
```


Verify the pod is *Running* and `/inetpub/wwwroot`

is mounted from SMB by using the `kubectl describe`

command:

```
kubectl describe pod iis-pod
```


The output of the command resembles the following example:

```
Name: iis-pod
Namespace: default

...
```


Verify your volume has been mounted on the pod by using the [kubectl exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec) command to connect to the pod. Then use the `dir`

command in the correct directory to check if the volume is mounted and the size matches the size of the volume you provisioned.

```
kubectl exec -it iis-pod –- cmd.exe
```


The output of the command resembles the following example:

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.1668]

# Best practices for storage and backups in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), your applications often need storage. Make sure you understand pod performance needs and access methods so that you can select the best storage for your application. The AKS node size may impact your storage choices. Plan for ways to back up and test the restore process for attached storage.

This best practices article focuses on storage considerations for cluster operators. In this article, you learn:

- What types of storage are available.
- How to correctly size AKS nodes for storage performance.
- Differences between dynamic and static provisioning of volumes.
- Ways to back up and secure your data volumes.

## Choose the appropriate storage type


Best practice guidanceUnderstand the needs of your application to pick the right storage. Use high performance, SSD-backed storage for production workloads. Plan for network-based storage when you need multiple concurrent connections.


Applications often require different types and speeds of storage. Determine the most appropriate storage type by asking the following questions.

- Do your applications need storage that connects to individual pods?
- Do your applications need storage shared across multiple pods?
- Is the storage for read-only access to data?
- Will the storage be used to write large amounts of structured data?

The following table outlines the available storage types and their capabilities:

| Use case | Volume plugin | Read/write once | Read-only many | Read/write many | Windows Server container support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shared configuration | Azure Files | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Structured app data | Azure Disks | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Unstructured data, file system operations |
|

AKS provides two primary types of secure storage for volumes backed by Azure Disks or Azure Files. Both use the default Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) that encrypts data at rest. Disks cannot be encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption at the AKS node level. With Azure Files shares, there is no limit as to how many can be mounted on a node.

Both Azure Files and Azure Disks are available in Standard and Premium performance tiers:

*Premium*disks- Backed by high-performance solid-state disks (SSDs).
- Recommended for all production workloads.

*Standard*disks- Backed by regular spinning disks (HDDs).
- Good for archival or infrequently accessed data.


While the default storage tier for the Azure Disk CSI driver is Premium SSD, your custom StorageClass can use Premium SSD, Standard SSD, or Standard HDD.

Understand the application performance needs and access patterns to choose the appropriate storage tier. For more information about Managed Disks sizes and performance tiers, see [Azure Managed Disks overview](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview).

### Create and use storage classes to define application needs

Define the type of storage you want using Kubernetes *storage classes*. The storage class is then referenced in the pod or deployment specification. Storage class definitions work together to create the appropriate storage and connect it to pods.

For more information, see [Storage classes in AKS](concepts-storage#storage-classes).

## Size the nodes for storage needs


Best practice guidanceEach node size supports a maximum number of disks. Different node sizes also provide different amounts of local storage and network bandwidth. Plan appropriately for your application demands to deploy the right size of nodes.


AKS nodes run as various Azure VM types and sizes. Each VM size provides:

- A different amount of core resources such as CPU and memory.
- A maximum number of disks that can be attached.

Storage performance also varies between VM sizes for the maximum local and attached disk IOPS (input/output operations per second).

If your applications require Azure Disks as their storage solution, strategize an appropriate node VM size. Storage capabilities and CPU and memory amounts play a major role when deciding on a VM size.

For example, while both the *Standard_B2ms* and *Standard_DS2_v2* VM sizes include a similar amount of CPU and memory resources, their potential storage performance is different:

| Node type and size | vCPU | Memory (GiB) | Max data disks | Max uncached disk IOPS | Max uncached throughput (MBps) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard_B2ms | 2 | 8 | 4 | 1,920 | 22.5 |
| Standard_DS2_v2 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 6,400 | 96 |

In this example, the *Standard_DS2_v2* offers twice as many attached disks, and three to four times the amount of IOPS and disk throughput. If you only compared core compute resources and compared costs, you might have chosen the *Standard_B2ms* VM size with poor storage performance and limitations.

Work with your application development team to understand their storage capacity and performance needs. Choose the appropriate VM size for the AKS nodes to meet or exceed their performance needs. Regularly baseline applications to adjust VM size as needed.

Note

By default, disk size and performance for managed disks is assigned according to the selected VM SKU and vCPU count. Default OS disk sizing is only used on new clusters or node pools when Ephemeral OS disks are not supported and a default OS disk size is not specified. For more information, see [Default OS disk sizing](cluster-configuration#default-os-disk-sizing).

For more information about available VM sizes, see [Sizes for Linux virtual machines in Azure](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes).

### Consider ephemeral NVMe data disks for maximum performance


Best practice guidanceConsider ephemeral NVMe data disks when you need the highest storage throughput and IOPS, and your workload can tolerate the temporary nature of local node storage. Ephemeral NVMe data disks provide low-latency, host-attached storage that delivers the highest IOPS and throughput available in Azure. NVMe disks are available on L-series, E-series, and GPU VMs, with expanding support for the newer Azure VM v6 and v7 families such as the D-series, F-series, H-series.


NVMe-backed storage enhances workloads that demand high-speed caching, temporary storage, or transient data processing. It eliminates the reliance on high-performance remote disks, which typically require the largest and most costly VM configurations to achieve optimal performance.

Common scenarios that benefit from ephemeral NVMe data disks include:

- AI training or inference pipelines that stage large datasets or checkpoints between iterations
- High-performance databases or streaming engines that maintain replicas or logs across pods
- Batch analytics jobs that require temporary scratch space or shuffle storage

Because NVMe data is tied to the node instance, plan for pod disruption budgets and ensure your application can quickly rebuild from durable storage or replication. Data placed on these disks is lost whenever a node is deallocated, reimaged, or fails.

For further recommendations on ephemeral NVMe data disks, see [Best practices for ephemeral NVMe data disks in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](best-practices-storage-nvme). To expose NVMe capacity to pods, use [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction), which will can orchestrate and create ephemeral **or** persistent volumes backed by local NVMe disks. For implementation guidance, see [Use Azure Container Storage with AKS](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-aks-quickstart).

Important

Use NVMe data disks only for workloads that can tolerate data loss and recover quickly. Keep business-critical data on durable storage such as Azure Disk or Azure Files.

## Dynamically provision volumes


Best practice guidanceTo reduce management overhead and enable scaling, avoid statically create and assign persistent volumes. Use dynamic provisioning. In your storage classes, define the appropriate reclaim policy to minimize unneeded storage costs once pods are deleted.


To attach storage to pods, use persistent volumes. Persistent volumes can be created manually or dynamically. Creating persistent volumes manually adds management overhead and limits your ability to scale. Instead, provision persistent volume dynamically to simplify storage management and allow your applications to grow and scale as needed.

A persistent volume claim (PVC) lets you dynamically create storage as needed. Underlying Azure disks are created as pods request them. In the pod definition, request a volume to be created and attached to a designated mount path.

For the concepts on how to dynamically create and use volumes, see [Persistent Volumes Claims](concepts-storage#persistent-volume-claims).

To see these volumes in action, see how to dynamically create and use a persistent volume with [Azure Disks](azure-disk-csi) or [Azure Files](azure-files-csi).

As part of your storage class definitions, set the appropriate *reclaimPolicy*. This reclaimPolicy controls the behavior of the underlying Azure storage resource when the pod is deleted. The underlying storage resource can either be deleted or retained for future pod use. Set the reclaimPolicy to *retain* or *delete*.

Understand your application needs, and implement regular checks for retained storage to minimize the amount of unused and billed storage.

For more information about storage class options, see [storage reclaim policies](concepts-storage#storage-classes).

## Secure and back up your data


Best practice guidanceBack up your data using an appropriate tool for your storage type, such as Velero or Azure Backup. Verify the integrity and security of those backups.


When your applications store and consume data persisted on disks or in files, you need to take regular backups or snapshots of that data. Azure Disks can use built-in snapshot technologies. Your applications may need to flush writes-to-disk before you perform the snapshot operation. [Velero](https://github.com/heptio/velero) can back up persistent volumes along with additional cluster resources and configurations. If you can't [remove state from your applications](operator-best-practices-multi-region#remove-service-state-from-inside-containers), back up the data from persistent volumes and regularly test the restore operations to verify data integrity and the processes required.

Understand the limitations of the different approaches to data backups and if you need to quiesce your data prior to snapshot. Data backups don't necessarily let you restore your application environment of cluster deployment. For more information about those scenarios, see [Best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery in AKS](operator-best-practices-multi-region).

# Draft for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft) is an open-source project that streamlines Kubernetes development by taking a non-containerized application and generating the Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configurations, and other artifacts associated with a containerized application. Draft can also create a GitHub Action workflow file to quickly build and deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster.

## How it works

Draft has the following commands to help ease your development on Kubernetes:

`draft create`

: Creates the Dockerfile and the proper manifest files.`draft setup-gh`

: Sets up your GitHub OIDC.`draft generate-workflow`

: Generates the GitHub Action workflow file for deployment onto your cluster.`draft up`

: Sets up your GitHub OIDC and generates a GitHub Action workflow file, combining the previous two commands.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - Install the latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows)and the*aks-preview*extension. - If you don't have one already, you need to create an
[AKS cluster](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster)and an Azure Container Registry instance.

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Create artifacts using `draft create`


You can use `draft create`

to create Dockerfiles, Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or Kustomize files needed to deploy your application onto an AKS cluster.

Create an artifact using the

command.`az aks draft create`

`az aks draft create`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft create --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Set up GitHub OIDC using `draft setup-gh`


To use Draft, you have to register your application with GitHub using `draft setup-gh`

. This step only needs to be done once per repository.

Register your application with GitHub using the

command.`az aks draft setup-gh`

`az aks draft setup-gh`


## Generate a GitHub Action workflow file for deployment using `draft generate-workflow`


After you create your artifacts and set up GitHub OIDC, you can use `draft generate-workflow`

to generate a GitHub Action workflow file, creating an action that deploys your application onto your AKS cluster. Once your workflow file is generated, you must commit it into your repository in order to initiate the GitHub Action.

Generate a GitHub Action workflow file using the

command.`az aks draft generate-workflow`

`az aks draft generate-workflow`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft generate-workflow --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Set up GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) and generate a GitHub Action workflow file using `draft up`


`draft up`

is a single command to accomplish GitHub OIDC setup and generate a GitHub Action workflow file for deployment. It effectively combines the `draft setup-gh`

and `draft generate-workflow`

commands, meaning it's most commonly used when getting started in a new repository for the first time, and only needs to be run once. Subsequent updates to the GitHub Action workflow file can be made using `draft generate-workflow`

.

Set up GitHub OIDC and generate a GitHub Action workflow file using the

command.`az aks draft up`

`az aks draft up`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft up --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`


## Use Application Routing with Draft to make your application accessible over the internet

Application Routing][app-routing](app-routing) is the easiest way to get your web application up and running in Kubernetes securely. Application Routing removes the complexity of ingress controllers and certificate and DNS management, and it offers configuration for enterprises looking to bring their own. Application Routing offers a managed ingress controller based on nginx that you can use without restrictions and integrates out of the box with Open Service Mesh to secure intra-cluster communications.

Set up Draft with Application Routing using the

and pass in the DNS name and Azure Key Vault-stored certificate when prompted.`az aks draft update`

`az aks draft update`

You can also run the command on a specific directory using the

`--destination`

flag, as shown in the following example:`az aks draft update --destination /Workspaces/ContosoAir`

# Deploy and test inference models with the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) in Visual Studio Code

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to use the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) add-on in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code. KAITO automatically provisions the right-sized GPU nodes and sets up the inference server as an endpoint server to your AI model(s), allowing you to test and experiment with AI on AKS with ease.

## Prerequisites

- The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code needs to be installed to use the KAITO experience. For more information, see
[Install the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code](aks-extension-vs-code#installation). - The cluster that you are deploying to is a Standard Cluster
*(Kaito cannot currently be installed on Automatic clusters)*. - Verify that your Azure subscription has GPU quota for your chosen model by checking the
[KAITO model workspaces](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets).

## Install KAITO on your cluster

- In the Kubernetes tab, under
**Clouds**>**Azure**>**your subscription**>**Deploy a LLM with KAITO**, right click on your cluster and select**Install KAITO**. - Once on the page, select
**Install KAITO**to start the KAITO installation process. - When the installation completes, you will see a
**Generate Workspace**button that redirects you to the model deployment page.

## Create a KAITO workspace

When creating a KAITO workspace, you can either deploy the default workspace CRD directly into your AKS cluster or save the CRD and customize it for your needs.

- In the Kubernetes tab, under
**Clouds**>**Azure**>**your subscription**>**Deploy a LLM with KAITO**, right click on your cluster and select**Create KAITO workspace**. - Find and select the model you want to deploy.
- Select
**Deploy default workspace CRD**or**Customize workspace CRD**. - Select
**Deploy default workspace CRD**to deploy the model. It tracks the progress of the model and notifies you once the model successfully deploys. It also notifies you if the model was already deployed unsuccessfully onto your cluster. - When the deployment completes, you see a
**View Deployed Models**button that redirects you to the deployment management page.

## Manage KAITO models

The **Manage KAITO models** page allows you to see all models deployed in your AKS cluster along with their status (*ongoing*, *successful*, or *failed*).

In the Kubernetes tab, under

**Clouds**>**Azure**>**your subscription**>**Deploy a LLM with KAITO**, right click on your cluster and select**Manage KAITO models**.From this page, you can choose to perform one of the following actions:

**Get logs**: Select**Get Logs**to access the latest logs from the KAITO workspace pods for your deployment. This action generates a new text file containing the most recent 500 lines of logs.**Delete a model**: Select**Delete Workspace**(or**Cancel**for ongoing deployments). For failed deployments, select**Redeploy Default CRD**to remove the current deployment and restart the model deployment process from scratch.**Test a model**: Select**Test**. This action brings you to a new page where you can interact with the deployed model through a chat interface.


## Test your model

In the Kubernetes tab, under

**Clouds**>**Azure**>**your subscription**>**Deploy a LLM with KAITO**, right click on your cluster and select**Manage KAITO models**.Select

**Test**. This action brings you to a new page where you can interact with the deployed model through the**Prompt**box chat interface.You can optionally adjust the parameters:

**Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the model's output. A low temperature is good for tasks needing precision, like math problems, while a high temperature is better for tasks like creative writing.**Top P**: Limits the next-word choices to a dynamic subset of the vocabulary, determined by a cumulative probability threshold.**Top K**: Limits the next-word selection to the top`K`

most probable words. Smaller`K`

values lead to more predictable outputs, while larger values increase variability.**Repetition Penalty**: Penalizes the model for repeating the same phrases, words, or sequences. This is useful for avoiding repetitive or looping outputs, especially in longer generations.**Max Length**: Defines the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) in the generated output.


For more information, see [AKS extension for Visual Studio Code features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/aksextensions#_features).

## Delete your model inference deployment

- Once you've finished testing the model(s) and you want to free up the allocated GPU resources on your cluster, go to the Kubernetes tab, and under
**Clouds**>**Azure**>**your subscription**>**Deploy a LLM with KAITO**, right click on your cluster and select**Manage KAITO models**. - For each deployed model, select
**Delete Workspace**to clear all allocated resources created by the inference deployment.

## Product support and feedback

If you have a question or want to offer product feedback, please open an issue on the [AKS extension GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-aks-tools/issues/new/choose).

# Use instance-level public IPs in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS nodes don't require their own public IP addresses for communication. However, scenarios may require nodes in a node pool to receive their own dedicated public IP addresses. A common scenario is for gaming workloads, where a console needs to make a direct connection to a cloud virtual machine to minimize hops. This scenario can be achieved on AKS by using Node Public IP.

First, create a new resource group.

```
az group create --name <resourceGroup> --location <region>
```


Create a new AKS cluster and attach a public IP for your nodes. Each of the nodes in the node pool receives a unique public IP. You can verify this by looking at the Virtual Machine Scale Set instances.

```
az aks create \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--name <aksClusterName> \
--location <region> \
--enable-node-public-ip \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


For existing AKS clusters, you can also add a new node pool, and attach a public IP for your nodes.

```
az aks nodepool add --resource-group <resourceGroup> --cluster-name <aksClusterName> --name <newNodePool> --enable-node-public-ip
```


## Use a public IP prefix

There are a number of [benefits to using a public IP prefix](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-address-prefix). AKS supports using addresses from an existing public IP prefix for your nodes by passing the resource ID with the flag `--node-public-ip-prefix-id`

when creating a new cluster or adding a node pool.

First, create a public IP prefix using [az network public-ip prefix create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/public-ip/prefix#az-network-public-ip-prefix-create):

```
az network public-ip prefix create --length 28 --location <region> --name <publicIPPrefixName> --resource-group <resourceGroup>
```


View the output, and take note of the `id`

for the prefix:

```
{
...
"id": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPPrefixes/<publicIPPrefixName>",
...
}
```


Finally, when creating a new cluster or adding a new node pool, use the flag `--node-public-ip-prefix-id`

and pass in the prefix's resource ID:

```
az aks create \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--name <aksClusterName> \
--location <region> \
--enable-node-public-ip \
--node-public-ip-prefix-id /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPPrefixes/<publicIPPrefixName> \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Locate public IPs for nodes

You can locate the public IPs for your nodes in various ways:

- Use the Azure CLI command
.`az vmss list-instance-public-ips`

- Use
[PowerShell or Bash commands](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking#public-ipv4-per-virtual-machine). - You can also view the public IPs in the Azure portal by viewing the instances in the Virtual Machine Scale Set.

Important

The [node resource group](faq) contains the nodes and their public IPs. Use the node resource group when executing commands to find the public IPs for your nodes.

```
az vmss list-instance-public-ips --resource-group <MC_region_aksClusterName_region> --name <virtualMachineScaleSetName>
```


## Use public IP tags on node public IPs

Public IP tags can be utilized on node public IPs to utilize the [Azure Routing Preference](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-overview) feature.

### Requirements

- AKS version 1.29 or greater is required.

### Create a new cluster using routing preference internet

```
az aks create \
--name <aksClusterName> \
--location <region> \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--enable-node-public-ip \
--node-public-ip-tags RoutingPreference=Internet \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Add a node pool with routing preference internet

```
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name <aksClusterName> \
--name <nodePoolName> \
--location <region> \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--enable-node-public-ip \
--node-public-ip-tags RoutingPreference=Internet
```


## Allow host port connections and add node pools to application security groups

AKS nodes utilizing node public IPs that host services on their host address need to have an NSG rule added to allow the traffic. Adding the desired ports in the node pool configuration will create the appropriate allow rules in the cluster network security group.

If a network security group is in place on the subnet with a cluster using bring-your-own virtual network, an allow rule must be added to that network security group. This can be limited to the nodes in a given node pool by adding the node pool to an [application security group (ASG)](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview#application-security-groups). A managed ASG will be created by default in the managed resource group if allowed host ports are specified. Nodes can also be added to one or more custom ASGs by specifying the resource ID of the NSG(s) in the node pool parameters.

### Host port specification format

When specifying the list of ports to allow, use a comma-separate list with entries in the format of `port/protocol`

or `startPort-endPort/protocol`

.

Examples:

- 80/tcp
- 80/tcp,443/tcp
- 53/udp,80/tcp
- 50000-60000/tcp

### Requirements

- AKS version 1.29 or greater is required.

### Create a new cluster with allowed ports and application security groups

```
az aks create \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--name <aksClusterName> \
--nodepool-name <nodePoolName> \
--nodepool-allowed-host-ports 80/tcp,443/tcp,53/udp,40000-60000/tcp,40000-50000/udp\
--nodepool-asg-ids "<asgId>,<asgId>" \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Add a new node pool with allowed ports and application security groups

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--cluster-name <aksClusterName> \
--name <nodePoolName> \
--allowed-host-ports 80/tcp,443/tcp,53/udp,40000-60000/tcp,40000-50000/udp \
--asg-ids "<asgId>,<asgId>"
```


### Update the allowed ports and application security groups for a node pool

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group <resourceGroup> \
--cluster-name <aksClusterName> \
--name <nodePoolName> \
--allowed-host-ports 80/tcp,443/tcp,53/udp,40000-60000/tcp,40000-50000/udp \
--asg-ids "<asgId>,<asgId>"
```


## Automatically assign host ports for pod workloads (PREVIEW)

When public IPs are configured on nodes, host ports can be utilized to allow pods to directly receive traffic without having to configure a load balancer service. This is especially useful in scenarios like gaming, where the ephemeral nature of the node IP and port is not a problem because a matchmaker service at a well-known hostname can provide the correct host and port to use at connection time. However, because only one process on a host can be listening on the same port, using applications with host ports can lead to problems with scheduling. To avoid this issue, AKS provides the ability to have the system dynamically assign an available port at scheduling time, preventing conflicts.

Warning

Pod host port traffic will be blocked by the default NSG rules in place on the cluster. This feature should be combined with allowing host ports on the node pool to allow traffic to flow.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Requirements

- AKS version 1.29 or greater is required.

### Register the 'PodHostPortAutoAssignPreview' feature flag

Register the `PodHostPortAutoAssignPreview`

feature flag by using the [az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "PodHostPortAutoAssignPreview"
```


It takes a few minutes for the status to show *Registered*. Verify the registration status by using the [az feature show](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-show) command:

```
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "PodHostPortAutoAssignPreview"
```


When the status reflects *Registered*, refresh the registration of the *Microsoft.ContainerService* resource provider by using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```


### Automatically assign a host port to a pod

Triggering host port auto assignment is done by deploying a workload without any host ports and applying the `kubernetes.azure.com/assign-hostports-for-containerports`

annotation with the list of ports that need host port assignments. The value of the annotation should be specified as a comma-separated list of entries like `port/protocol`

, where the port is an individual port number that is defined in the Pod spec and the protocol is `tcp`

or `udp`

.

Ports will be assigned from the range `40000-59999`

and will be unique across the cluster. The assigned ports will also be added to environment variables inside the pod so that the application can determine what ports were assigned. The environment variable name will be in the following format (example below): `<deployment name>_PORT_<port number>_<protocol>_HOSTPORT`

, so an example would be `mydeployment_PORT_8080_TCP_HOSTPORT: 41932`

.

Here is an example `echoserver`

deployment, showing the mapping of host ports for ports 8080 and 8443:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: echoserver-hostport
labels:
app: echoserver-hostport
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: echoserver-hostport
template:
metadata:
annotations:
kubernetes.azure.com/assign-hostports-for-containerports: 8080/tcp,8443/tcp
labels:
app: echoserver-hostport
spec:
nodeSelector:
kubernetes.io/os: linux
containers:
- name: echoserver-hostport

ports:
- name: http
containerPort: 8080
protocol: TCP
- name: https
containerPort: 8443
protocol: TCP
```


When the deployment is applied, the `hostPort`

entries will be in the YAML of the individual pods:

```
$ kubectl describe pod echoserver-hostport-75dc8d8855-4gjfc
<cut for brevity>
Containers:
echoserver-hostport:

# Deploy WireGuard encryption with Advanced Container Networking Services (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

WireGuard encryption with Advanced Cluster Networking Services is currently in PREVIEW.

See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article shows you how to deploy WireGuard encryption with Advanced Container Networking Services in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.71.0. To find the version, run

`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).WireGuard encryption is only supported with the Azure CNI powered by Cilium. If you're using any other network plugin, WireGuard encryption isn't supported. See

[Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium).WireGuard establishes encrypted tunnels over UDP port 51871, which is exposed on each AKS node. Ensure UDP port 51871 is allowed between all node IPs, especially if your environment uses firewalls.


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension using the [ az extension add](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-add) or

[command.](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az-extension-update)

`az extension update`

The minimum version of the aks-preview Azure CLI extension is `14.0.0b6`


```
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview
# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```


### Register the `AdvancedNetworkingWireGuardPreview`

feature flag

Register the `AdvancedNetworkingWireGuardPreview`

feature flag using the [ az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command.

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingWireGuardPreview"
```


Verify successful registration using the [ az feature show](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-show) command. It takes a few minutes for the registration to complete.

```
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingWireGuardPreview"
```


Once the feature shows `Registered`

, refresh the registration of the `Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider using the [ az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) command.

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services and WireGuard

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) enabled.

The `az aks create`

command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`

, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering. To learn more visit[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security).

Note

Clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Observability and Container Network security starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.
WireGuard is disabled by default even after enabling ACNS. To enable WireGuard set the encryption type by using the flag `--acns-transit-encryption-type wireguard`

.

```
# Set environment variables for the AKS cluster name and resource group. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resourcegroup-name>"
# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--location eastus \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--enable-acns \
--acns-transit-encryption-type wireguard \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Enable Advanced Container Networking Services and WireGuard on an existing cluster

The [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,

`--enable-acns`

, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features, which includes [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability)and the

[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security)feature.

Important

Enabling WireGuard on an existing cluster will trigger a rollout restart of the Cilium agent across all nodes. For large clusters, this process can take some time and may temporarily impact workloads. It's recommended to plan the update during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimise disruption

Note

Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

WireGuard is disabled by default even after enabling ACNS. To enable WireGuard set the encryption type by using the flag `--acns-transit-encryption-type wireguard`

.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns \
--acns-transit-encryption-type wireguard
```


## Get cluster credentials

Get your cluster credentials using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Validate the setup

Validate that WireGuard is enabled successfully using cilium-dbg cli

Note

It might take a few minutes for WireGuard to be fully enabled and configured across all nodes after activation.

- Run a bash shell in one of the Cilium pods

```
kubectl -n kube-system exec -ti ds/cilium -- bash
```


- Check that WireGuard is enabled

```
cilium-dbg encrypt status
```


Expected output:

```
Encryption: Wireguard
Interface: cilium_wg0
Public key: jikeOvVATORm/1GD0kZLxKhw1lofdsfdgiXWVyVIR3T0=
Number of peers: 2
```


The number of peers should equal the number of nodes minus one.

## Troubleshooting

When WireGuard encryption is enabled in an AKS cluster using Cilium CNI, you can use the cilium-dbg CLI tool to inspect tunnel status, verify peer connectivity, and debug encryption-related issues.

### Inspect WireGuard peers

You can inspect peer status and configuration on each node using:

```
kubectl exec -n kube-system ds/cilium -- cilium-dbg debuginfo --output json | jq .encryption
```


Expected output:

```
{
"wireguard": {
"interfaces": [
{
"listen-port": 51871,
"name": "cilium_wg0",
"peer-count": 1,
"peers": [
{
"allowed-ips": [
"10.244.1.31/32",
"10.244.1.206/32",
"10.224.0.6/32"
],
"endpoint": "10.224.0.6:51871",
"last-handshake-time": "2025-04-24T11:13:49.102Z",

}
],
"public-key": "jikeOvVATORm/1GD0kZLxKhw1lofdsfdgiXWVyVIR3T0="
}
],
"node-encryption": "Disabled"
}
}
```


This output shows the current state of WireGuard encryption on the node.

- listen-port: The UDP port (51871) where this node is listening for encrypted traffic from peers.
- peer-count: The number of remote WireGuard peers configured for this node.
- peers:
- allowed-ips: list of pod IP addresses routed through the encrypted tunnel to this peer.
- endpoint: The IP and port of the remote peer's WireGuard interface.
- last-handshake-time: Timestamp of the most recent successful key exchange with this peer.
- public-key: The public key of the remote peer.
- transfer-rx / transfer-tx: The total number of bytes received/transmitted over the tunnel.

- public-key: The local WireGuard interface’s public key.
- node-encryption: Encrypts traffic originating from the node itself or from host-network pods. At present, only pod traffic is encrypted. Node encryption is not yet supported and remains disabled by default.

## Disabling WireGuard on an existing cluster

WireGuard can be disabled independently without affecting other ACNS features. To disable it, set the flag `--acns-transit-encryption-type=none`

.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns \
--acns-transit-encryption-type none
```


## Known issues

- Packets might be dropped when configuring the WireGuard device leading to connectivity issues. This issue happens when endpoints are added or removed or when node updates occur. In some cases, this issue might lead to failed calls to
