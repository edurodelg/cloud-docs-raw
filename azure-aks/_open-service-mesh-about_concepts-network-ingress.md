Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) is a lightweight, extensible, cloud native service mesh that allows you to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the-box observability features for highly dynamic microservice environments.

OSM runs an Envoy-based control plane on Kubernetes and can be configured with [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) APIs. OSM works by injecting an Envoy proxy as a sidecar container with each instance of your application. The Envoy proxy contains and executes rules around access control policies, implements routing configuration, and captures metrics. The control plane continually configures the Envoy proxies to ensure policies and routing rules are up to date and proxies are healthy.

Microsoft started the OSM project, but it's now governed by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

Warning

Microsoft has announced the retirement of the [Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). The upstream OSM project has also been retired by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/). Identify any existing OSM configurations and migrate them to equivalent Istio configurations. For migration steps, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

## Enable the OSM add-on

OSM can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the OSM add-on using the [Azure CLI](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-az-cli) or a [Bicep template](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-bicep). The OSM add-on provides a fully supported installation of OSM that's integrated with AKS.

Important

Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.

| Kubernetes version | OSM version installed |
|---|---|
| 1.24.0 or greater | 1.2.5 |
| Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3 |
| Below 1.23.5 | 1.0.0 |

Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

## Capabilities and features

OSM provides the following capabilities and features:

- Secure service-to-service communication by enabling mutual TLS (mTLS).
- Onboard applications onto the OSM mesh using automatic sidecar injection of Envoy proxy.
- Transparently configure traffic shifting on deployments.
- Define and execute fine-grained access control policies for services.
- Monitor and debug services using observability and insights into application metrics.
- Encrypt communications between service endpoints deployed in the cluster.
- Enable traffic authorization of both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic.
- Configure weighted traffic controls between two or more services for A/B testing or canary deployments.
- Collect and view KPIs from application traffic.
- Integrate with external certificate management.
- Integrate with existing ingress solutions such as
[NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx),[Contour](https://projectcontour.io/), and[Application Routing](app-routing).

For more information on ingress and OSM, see [Using ingress to manage external access to services within the cluster](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/ingress/) and [Integrate OSM with Contour for ingress](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/demos/ingress_contour). For an example of how to integrate OSM with ingress controllers using the `networking.k8s.io/v1`

API, see [Ingress with Kubernetes Nginx ingress controller](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/demos/ingress_k8s_nginx). For more information on using Application Routing, which automatically integrates with OSM, see [Application Routing](app-routing).

## Limitations

The OSM AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- After installation, you must enable Iptables redirection for port IP address and port range exclusion using
`kubectl patch`

. For more information, see[iptables redirection](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/iptables_redirection/). - Any pods that need access to IMDS, Azure DNS, or the Kubernetes API server must have their IP addresses added to the global list of excluded outbound IP ranges using
[Global outbound IP range exclusions](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/iptables_redirection/#global-outbound-ip-range-exclusions).

- The add-on doesn't work on AKS clusters that are using
[Istio based service mesh addon for AKS](istio-about).

- OSM doesn't support Windows Server containers.

## Next steps

After enabling the OSM add-on using the [Azure CLI](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-az-cli) or a [Bicep template](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-bicep), you can:

# Ingress in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Ingress in AKS is a Kubernetes resource that manages external HTTP-like traffic access to [services](concepts-network-services) within a cluster. An AKS ingress may provide services like load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. For more information about Kubernetes Ingress, see the [Kubernetes Ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Ingress controllers

When managing application traffic, Ingress controllers provide advanced capabilities by operating at layer 7. They can route HTTP traffic to different applications based on the inbound URL, allowing for more intelligent and flexible traffic distribution rules. For example, an ingress controller can direct traffic to different microservices depending on the URL path, enhancing the efficiency and organization of your services.

On the other hand, a LoadBalancer-type Service, when created, sets up an underlying Azure load balancer resource. This load balancer works at layer 4, distributing traffic to the pods in your Service on a specified port. However, layer 4 services are unaware of the actual applications and can't implement these types of complex routing rules.

Understanding the distinction between these two approaches helps in selecting the right tool for your traffic management needs.

## Compare ingress options

The following table lists the feature differences between the different ingress controller options:

| Feature | Application Routing addon | Application Gateway for Containers | Azure Service Mesh/Istio-based service mesh |
|---|---|---|---|
Ingress/Gateway controller |
NGINX ingress controller | Azure Application Gateway for Containers | Istio Ingress Gateway |
API |
Ingress API | Ingress API and Gateway API |
|

**Hosting****Scaling****Load balancing****SSL termination****mTLS****Static IP Address****Azure Key Vault stored SSL certificates****Azure DNS integration for DNS zone management**The following table lists the different scenarios where you might use each ingress controller:

| Ingress option | When to use |
|---|---|
Managed NGINX - Application Routing addon |
• In-cluster hosted, customizable, and scalable NGINX ingress controllers. • Basic load balancing and routing capabilities. • Internal and external load balancer configuration. • Static IP address configuration. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress API. |
Application Gateway for Containers |
• Azure hosted ingress gateway. • Flexible deployment strategies managed by the controller or bring your own Application Gateway for Containers. • Advanced traffic management features such as automatic retries, availability zone resiliency, mutual authentication (mTLS) to backend target, traffic splitting / weighted round robin, and autoscaling. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress and Gateway APIs. |
Istio Ingress Gateway |
• Based on Envoy, when using with Istio for a service mesh. • Advanced traffic management features such as rate limiting and circuit breaking. • Support for mTLS |

Note

Gateway API for [Istio ingress traffic](istio-deploy-ingress) is not yet supported for the Istio add-on, but is currently under active development.

## Create an Ingress resource

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing addon, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Client source IP preservation

Configure your ingress controller to preserve the client source IP on requests to containers in your AKS cluster. When your ingress controller routes a client's request to a container in your AKS cluster, the original source IP of that request is unavailable to the target container. When you enable *client source IP preservation*, the source IP for the client is available in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*.

If you're using client source IP preservation on your ingress controller, you can't use TLS pass-through. Client source IP preservation and TLS pass-through can be used with other services, such as the *LoadBalancer* type.

To learn more about client source IP preservation, see [How client source IP preservation works for LoadBalancer Services in AKS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/how-client-source-ip-preservation-works-for-loadbalancer/ba-p/3033722#:%7E:text=Enable%20Client%20source%20IP%20preservation%201%20Edit%20loadbalancer,is%20the%20same%20as%20the%20source%20IP%20%28srjumpbox%29.).
