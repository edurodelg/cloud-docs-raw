Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors
