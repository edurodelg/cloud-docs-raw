Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create one or more node pools in an AKS cluster.

Note

This feature enables more control over creating and managing multiple node pools and requires separate commands for *create/update/delete* (CRUD) operations. Previously, cluster operations through [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) or

[used the managedCluster API and were the only options to change your control plane and a single node pool. This feature exposes a separate operation set for agent pools through the agentPool API and requires use of the](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update)

`az aks update`

[command set to execute operations on an individual node pool.](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool)

`az aks nodepool`

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To deploy an ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the

`Microsoft.Resources/deployments`

resource type. For example, to deploy a virtual machine (VM), you need`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`

and`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`

permissions. For a list of roles and permissions, see[Azure built-in roles](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).Review the following requirements for each parameter:

`osTYPE`

: The operating system type. The default is Linux.`osSKU`

: Specifies the OS SKU used by the agent pool.`count`

: Number of agents (VMs) to host docker containers. Allowed values must be in the range of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) for user pools and in the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive) for system pools. The default value is 1.

After you deploy the cluster using an ARM template, you can use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to connect to the cluster and deploy the sample application.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create AKS clusters that support multiple node pools:

You can delete the system node pool if you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster. Otherwise, you can't delete the system node pool.

System pools must contain at least one node. User node pools can contain zero or more nodes.

**If you create a cluster with a single node pool, the OS type must be**. The OS SKU can be any Linux variation such as`Linux`

`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

. You can't create a cluster with a single Windows node pool. If you want to run Windows containers, you must[add a Windows node pool](#add-a-windows-server-node-pool)to the cluster after creating it with a Linux system node pool.The AKS cluster must use the Standard SKU load balancer to use multiple node pools. This feature isn't supported with Basic SKU load balancers.

The AKS cluster must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets for the nodes.

The name of a node pool can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-12 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.

All node pools must reside in the same virtual network.

You can't change the virtual machine (VM) size of a node pool after you create it.

When you create multiple node pools at cluster creation time, the Kubernetes versions for the node pools must match the version set for the control plane. You can make updates after provisioning the cluster using per node pool operations.


## Create specialized node pools

To learn how to create specialized node pools, see the following articles:

[Add an Azure Spot node pool to an AKS cluster](spot-node-pool)[Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an AKS cluster](virtual-machines-node-pools)[Add a dedicated system node pool to an AKS cluster](use-system-pools#add-a-dedicated-system-node-pool-to-an-existing-aks-cluster)[Enabled Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) on an AKS node pool](enable-fips-nodes)[Add a node pool with a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) on an AKS cluster](use-cvm)[Create node pools with unique subnets in AKS](node-pool-unique-subnet)[Add a generation 2 VM node pool to an AKS cluster](generation-2-vms)[Add a node pool with Artifact Streaming to an AKS cluster](artifact-streaming)[Add Windows Server node pools with](windows-containerd)`containerd`

to an AKS cluster

## Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables in your shell to simplify the commands in this article. You can change the values to your preferred names.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="my-aks-rg" export LOCATION="eastus" export CLUSTER_NAME="my-aks-cluster" export NODE_POOL_NAME="mynodepool"`


## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using the Azure CLI

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_1_azure-linux) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_os-guard) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_flatcar)

Create a cluster with a single Ubuntu node pool using the

command. This step specifies two nodes in the single node pool.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --node-count 2 \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --location $LOCATION \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster.

When the cluster is ready, get the cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add a second node pool using the Azure CLI

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

Note

If you want to add a node pool that uses **Ephemeral OS disks** to your AKS cluster, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Ephemeral`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

With Ephemeral OS, you can deploy VMs and instance images up to the size of the VM cache. The default node OS disk configuration in AKS uses 128 GB, which means that you need a VM size that has a cache larger than 128 GB. The default `Standard_DS2_v2`

has a cache size of 86 GB, which isn't large enough. The `Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU has a cache size of 172 GB, which is large enough. You can also reduce the default size of the OS disk using `--node-osdisk-size`

, but keep in mind the minimum size for AKS images is 30 GB.

If you want to create node pools with **network-attached OS disks**, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Managed`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

### Add a Linux node pool

-
[Add an Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_2_ubuntu) -
[Add an Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_2_azure-linux) -
[Add an Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_os-guard) -
[Add a Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_flatcar)

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Linux`

node pool with the`Ubuntu`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes. If you don't specify an OS SKU, AKS defaults to`Ubuntu`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Linux \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --node-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to create the node pool.


### Add a Windows Server node pool

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Register the `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pool

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Windows`

node pool with the`Windows2025`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes.For more information about Windows OS, see

[Windows best practices](windows-best-practices).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Windows \ --os-sku Windows2025 \ --node-count 3`


## Check the status of your node pools

Check the status of your node pools using the

command and specify your resource group and cluster name.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using an ARM template

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

### Create a `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

resource

- Create a
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

resource by adding[this JSON](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template)to your template.

Create a single Ubuntu node pool in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "1", "osSKU": "ubuntu", "osType": "linux" } ], }`


## Add a second node pool using an ARM template

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-an-arm-template) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pools

Create multiple Windows node pools in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "3", "osSKU": "windows2025", "osType": "windows" } ], }`


## Deploy your ARM template

- Deploy your ARM template by following the guidance in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using an ARM template](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template).

## Set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool

When creating a node pool, you can add taints, labels, or tags to it. When you add a taint, label, or tag, all nodes within that node pool also get that taint, label, or tag. We recommend applying these properties to an entire node pool instead of individual nodes. This way, you can easily manage the properties of all nodes in the node pool by updating the node pool properties instead of updating each node individually.

For specific instructions on how to set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool, use the following resources:

[Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-node-taints)[Use labels in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-labels)[Use Azure tags in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-tags)[Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations)

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create an AKS cluster with a single node pool and add additional node pools to your cluster. To learn more about how to manage your node pools, see the following articles:

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To deploy an ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the

`Microsoft.Resources/deployments`

resource type. For example, to deploy a virtual machine (VM), you need`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`

and`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`

permissions. For a list of roles and permissions, see[Azure built-in roles](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).Review the following requirements for each parameter:

`osTYPE`

: The operating system type. The default is Linux.`osSKU`

: Specifies the OS SKU used by the agent pool.`count`

: Number of agents (VMs) to host docker containers. Allowed values must be in the range of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) for user pools and in the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive) for system pools. The default value is 1.

After you deploy the cluster using an ARM template, you can use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to connect to the cluster and deploy the sample application.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create AKS clusters that support multiple node pools:

You can delete the system node pool if you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster. Otherwise, you can't delete the system node pool.

System pools must contain at least one node. User node pools can contain zero or more nodes.

**If you create a cluster with a single node pool, the OS type must be**. The OS SKU can be any Linux variation such as`Linux`

`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

. You can't create a cluster with a single Windows node pool. If you want to run Windows containers, you must[add a Windows node pool](#add-a-windows-server-node-pool)to the cluster after creating it with a Linux system node pool.The AKS cluster must use the Standard SKU load balancer to use multiple node pools. This feature isn't supported with Basic SKU load balancers.

The AKS cluster must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets for the nodes.

The name of a node pool can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-12 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.

All node pools must reside in the same virtual network.

You can't change the virtual machine (VM) size of a node pool after you create it.

When you create multiple node pools at cluster creation time, the Kubernetes versions for the node pools must match the version set for the control plane. You can make updates after provisioning the cluster using per node pool operations.


## Create specialized node pools

To learn how to create specialized node pools, see the following articles:

[Add an Azure Spot node pool to an AKS cluster](spot-node-pool)[Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an AKS cluster](virtual-machines-node-pools)[Add a dedicated system node pool to an AKS cluster](use-system-pools#add-a-dedicated-system-node-pool-to-an-existing-aks-cluster)[Enabled Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) on an AKS node pool](enable-fips-nodes)[Add a node pool with a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) on an AKS cluster](use-cvm)[Create node pools with unique subnets in AKS](node-pool-unique-subnet)[Add a generation 2 VM node pool to an AKS cluster](generation-2-vms)[Add a node pool with Artifact Streaming to an AKS cluster](artifact-streaming)[Add Windows Server node pools with](windows-containerd)`containerd`

to an AKS cluster

## Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables in your shell to simplify the commands in this article. You can change the values to your preferred names.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="my-aks-rg" export LOCATION="eastus" export CLUSTER_NAME="my-aks-cluster" export NODE_POOL_NAME="mynodepool"`


## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using the Azure CLI

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_os-guard) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_flatcar)

Create a cluster with a single Ubuntu node pool using the

command. This step specifies two nodes in the single node pool.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --node-count 2 \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --location $LOCATION \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster.

When the cluster is ready, get the cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add a second node pool using the Azure CLI

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

Note

If you want to add a node pool that uses **Ephemeral OS disks** to your AKS cluster, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Ephemeral`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

With Ephemeral OS, you can deploy VMs and instance images up to the size of the VM cache. The default node OS disk configuration in AKS uses 128 GB, which means that you need a VM size that has a cache larger than 128 GB. The default `Standard_DS2_v2`

has a cache size of 86 GB, which isn't large enough. The `Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU has a cache size of 172 GB, which is large enough. You can also reduce the default size of the OS disk using `--node-osdisk-size`

, but keep in mind the minimum size for AKS images is 30 GB.

If you want to create node pools with **network-attached OS disks**, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Managed`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

### Add a Linux node pool

-
[Add an Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_2_ubuntu) -

[Add an Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_os-guard) -
[Add a Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_flatcar)

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Linux`

node pool with the`Ubuntu`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes. If you don't specify an OS SKU, AKS defaults to`Ubuntu`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Linux \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --node-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to create the node pool.


### Add a Windows Server node pool

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Register the `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pool

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Windows`

node pool with the`Windows2025`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes.For more information about Windows OS, see

[Windows best practices](windows-best-practices).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Windows \ --os-sku Windows2025 \ --node-count 3`


## Check the status of your node pools

Check the status of your node pools using the

command and specify your resource group and cluster name.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using an ARM template

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

### Create a `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

Create a single Ubuntu node pool in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "1", "osSKU": "ubuntu", "osType": "linux" } ], }`


## Add a second node pool using an ARM template

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-an-arm-template) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Register the `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pools

Create multiple Windows node pools in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "3", "osSKU": "windows2025", "osType": "windows" } ], }`


## Deploy your ARM template

- Deploy your ARM template by following the guidance in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using an ARM template](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template).

## Set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool

When creating a node pool, you can add taints, labels, or tags to it. When you add a taint, label, or tag, all nodes within that node pool also get that taint, label, or tag. We recommend applying these properties to an entire node pool instead of individual nodes. This way, you can easily manage the properties of all nodes in the node pool by updating the node pool properties instead of updating each node individually.

For specific instructions on how to set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool, use the following resources:
