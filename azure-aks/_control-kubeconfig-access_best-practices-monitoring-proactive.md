Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can interact with Kubernetes clusters using the `kubectl`

tool. The Azure CLI provides an easy way to get the access credentials and *kubeconfig* configuration file to connect to your AKS clusters using `kubectl`

. You can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to limit who can get access to the *kubeconfig* file and the permissions they have.

This article shows you how to assign Azure roles that limit who can get the configuration information for an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[the Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - This article also requires that you're running Azure CLI version 2.0.65 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Available permissions for cluster roles

When you interact with an AKS cluster using the `kubectl`

tool, a configuration file, called *kubeconfig*, defines cluster connection information. This configuration file is typically stored in *~/.kube/config*. Multiple clusters can be defined in this *kubeconfig* file. You can switch between clusters using the [ kubectl config use-context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#config) command.

The [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command lets you get the access credentials for an AKS cluster and merges these credentials into the

*kubeconfig*file. You can use Azure RBAC to control access to these credentials. These Azure roles let you define who can retrieve the

*kubeconfig*file and what permissions they have within the cluster.

There are two Azure roles you can apply to a Microsoft Entra user or group:

**Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role**- Allows access to
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterAdminCredential/action`

API call. This API call[lists the cluster admin credentials](/en-us/rest/api/aks/managedclusters/listclusteradmincredentials). - Downloads
*kubeconfig*for the*clusterAdmin*role.

- Allows access to
**Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role**- Allows access to
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action`

API call. This API call[lists the cluster user credentials](/en-us/rest/api/aks/managedclusters/listclusterusercredentials). - Downloads
*kubeconfig*for*clusterUser*role.

- Allows access to

Note

On clusters that use Microsoft Entra ID, users with the *clusterUser* role have an empty *kubeconfig* file that prompts a login. Once logged in, users have access based on their Microsoft Entra user or group settings. Users with the *clusterAdmin* role have admin access.

On clusters that don't use Microsoft Entra ID, the *clusterUser* role has same effect of *clusterAdmin* role.

## Assign role permissions to a user or group

To assign one of the available roles, you need to get the resource ID of the AKS cluster and the ID of the Microsoft Entra user account or group using the following steps:

- Get the cluster resource ID using the
command for the cluster named`az aks show`

*myAKSCluster*in the*myResourceGroup*resource group. Provide your own cluster and resource group name as needed. - Use the
and`az account show`

commands to get your user ID.`az ad user show`

- Assign a role using the
command.`az role assignment create`


The following example assigns the *Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role* to an individual user account:

```
# Get the resource ID of your AKS cluster
AKS_CLUSTER=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query id -o tsv)
# Get the account credentials for the logged in user
ACCOUNT_UPN=$(az account show --query user.name -o tsv)
ACCOUNT_ID=$(az ad user show --id $ACCOUNT_UPN --query objectId -o tsv)
# Assign the 'Cluster Admin' role to the user
az role assignment create \
--assignee $ACCOUNT_ID \
--scope $AKS_CLUSTER \
--role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
```


If you want to assign permissions to a Microsoft Entra group, update the `--assignee`

parameter shown in the previous example with the object ID for the *group* rather than the *user*.

To get the object ID for a group, use the [ az ad group show](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-show) command. The following command gets the object ID for the Microsoft Entra group named

*appdev*:

```
az ad group show --group appdev --query objectId -o tsv
```


Important

In some cases, such as Microsoft Entra guest users, the *user.name* in the account is different than the *userPrincipalName*.

```
$ az account show --query user.name -o tsv
user@contoso.com
$ az ad user list --query "[?contains(otherMails,'user@contoso.com')].{UPN:userPrincipalName}" -o tsv
user_contoso.com#EXT#@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```


In this case, set the value of *ACCOUNT_UPN* to the *userPrincipalName* from the Microsoft Entra user. For example, if your account *user.name* is *user@contoso.com*, this action would look like the following example:

```
ACCOUNT_UPN=$(az ad user list --query "[?contains(otherMails,'user@contoso.com')].{UPN:userPrincipalName}" -o tsv)
```


## Get and verify the configuration information

Once the roles are assigned, use the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command to get the

*kubeconfig*definition for your AKS cluster. The following example gets the

*--admin*credentials, which works correctly if the user has been granted the

*Cluster Admin Role*:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
```


You can then use the [ kubectl config view](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#config) command to verify that the

*context*for the cluster shows that the admin configuration information has been applied.

```
$ kubectl config view
```


Your output should look similar to the following example output:

```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
server: https://myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-4839be06.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io:443
name: myAKSCluster
contexts:
- context:
cluster: myAKSCluster
user: clusterAdmin_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster
name: myAKSCluster-admin
current-context: myAKSCluster-admin
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: clusterAdmin_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster
user:
client-certificate-data: REDACTED
client-key-data: REDACTED
token: e9f2f819a4496538b02cefff94e61d35
```


## Remove role permissions

To remove role assignments, use the [ az role assignment delete](/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-delete) command. Specify the account ID and cluster resource ID that you obtained in the previous steps. If you assigned the role to a group rather than a user, specify the appropriate group object ID rather than account object ID for the

`--assignee`

parameter.```
az role assignment delete --assignee $ACCOUNT_ID --scope $AKS_CLUSTER
```


## Next steps

For enhanced security on access to AKS clusters, [integrate Microsoft Entra authentication](azure-ad-integration-cli).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article covers the best practices for proactive monitoring on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and provides a comprehensive list of the key signals AKS recommends for you to monitor.

Proactively monitoring your AKS clusters is crucial for reducing downtime and saving business interruptions for your applications. This process involves identifying and monitoring key indicators of abnormal behavior in your cluster that might lead to major issues or downtime.

## Monitoring and alerting overview

Monitoring on AKS involves using metrics, logs, and events to ensure the health and performance of your cluster. Common scenarios to monitor include node performance, pod status, and overall resource utilization in your cluster. Logs provide insights into system events and cluster operations and activity. For more information about the methods and signals AKS provides for monitoring, see [Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](monitor-aks).

The best way to proactively monitor your cluster is to configure [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview). Alerts act as proactive measures to notify you of potential issues or anomalies before they escalate into critical problems. By defining thresholds for key metrics and logs, you receive immediate alerts when these signals exceed predefined limits, indicating potential issues like resource exhaustion or application failures. We highly recommend defining [service-level objectives (SLOs)](/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/metrics) for your application to measure the performance and reliability of your service. Configuring alerts on the key signals for your SLOs allows you to quickly detect any degradation of your application's quality of service that your customers receive. Overall, setting timely alerts enables you to quickly investigate and remediate problems, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability of applications running on your AKS cluster.

## How to configure alerts on specific metric types

To get holistic coverage of your AKS environment, you need to configure alerts on the three main components of your cluster:

**Cluster infrastructure**: Alerts targeting the underlying infrastructure of your cluster such as nodes, disks, and networking.**Application health**: Alerts for monitoring the health of your pods and applications. Some common indicators of unhealthy applications include out-of-memory kills (OOMKills) of your pods, pods in not ready state, etc.**Kubernetes control plane**: Alerts on AKS control plane to monitor the health and performance of the API server, etcd, and other components.

The following sections contain the key signals which we recommend all AKS customers monitor closely. The AKS team is working to add all critical signals to the existing [Recommended Alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-metric-alerts) feature, which allows you to easily enable alerts for all signals with a one-click experience. The Prometheus metrics alerts are available in Public Preview today, and the remaining alerts are estimated to be available in early 2025. For now, you can manually configure alerts on the critical signals.

### Cluster infrastructure alerts

| Alert scenario | Source | Signal | Recommended threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cluster is in a failed state | Azure Activity Logs | Create or update managed cluster | Status of the log is Failed, indicating that the cluster upgrade or creation action failed. |
| Node pool is in a failed state | Azure Activity Logs | Create or update agent pool | Status of the log is Failed, indicating that the node pool is in a Failed state due to a failed Create, Read, Upgrade, or Delete (CRUD) operation. |
| High Node OS Disk Bandwidth Usage | Virtual Machine Scale Set Metric | OS Disk Bandwidth Consumed Percentage | Node OS disk bandwidth utilization is above 95%. |
| High Node OS Disk IOPS Usage | Virtual Machine Scale Set Metric | OS Disk IOPS Consumed Percentage | Node OS disk IOPS utilization is above 95%. |
| High Node OS Disk Space Usage | AKS Platform Metric | Disk Used Percentage | Node OS disk space percentage utilization is above 90%. |
| High Node CPU Usage | AKS Platform Metric | CPU Usage Percentage | Node CPU Usage is greater than 90%. |
| High Node Memory Usage | AKS Platform Metric | Memory Working Set Percentage | Node Memory Usage is greater than 90%. |
| Node is in NotReady state | AKS Platform Metric | Status for various node conditions | Node is in NotReady state for >20 minutes. |
| SNAT port exhaustion | Load Balancer (LB) Metric | SNAT Connection Count | Filter for Connection State = "Failed" |

### Application health alerts
