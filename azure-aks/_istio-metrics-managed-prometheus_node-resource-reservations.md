Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This guide explains how to set up and use Azure Managed Prometheus to collect metrics from Istio service mesh add-on workloads on your Azure Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

Complete steps to enable the Istio add-on on the cluster as per

[documentation](istio-deploy-addon)

## Enable Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus

Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus collects data from Azure Kubernetes cluster.
To enable Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus, you must create an [Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage?tabs=cli#create-an-azure-monitor-workspace) to store the metrics:

```
export AZURE_MONITOR_WORKSPACE=<azure-monitor-workspace-name>
export AZURE_MONITOR_WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor account create \
--name $AZURE_MONITOR_WORKSPACE \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--location $LOCATION \
--query id -o tsv)
```


### Enable Prometheus addon

To collect Prometheus metrics from your Kubernetes cluster, [enable Prometheus addon](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable?tabs=cli#enable-with-cli):

```
az aks update --enable-azure-monitor-metrics --name $CLUSTER --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --azure-monitor-workspace-resource-id $AZURE_MONITOR_WORKSPACE_ID
```


### Customize scraping of Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitor managed service

Create a scrape config in a file named `prometheus-config`

, similar to the sample provided below. This configuration enables pod annotation-based scraping, which allows Prometheus to automatically discover and scrape metrics from pods with specific annotations.

Important

The scrape config below is just an example. We **highly** recommend customizing it based on your needs. If not adjusted, it could lead to unexpected costs from frequent metric collection and increased data storage.

```
global:
scrape_interval: 30s
scrape_configs:
- job_name: workload
scheme: http
kubernetes_sd_configs:
- role: endpoints
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
action: keep
regex: true
- source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
action: replace
target_label: __metrics_path__
regex: (.+)
- source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
action: replace
regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)?;(\d+)
replacement: $1:$2
target_label: __address__
```


To [enable pod annotation-based scraping](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration), create configmap `ama-metrics-prometheus-config`

that references `prometheus-config`

file in `kube-system`

namespace.

```
kubectl create configmap ama-metrics-prometheus-config --from-file=prometheus-config -n kube-system
```


### Verify Metric Collection

Configure access permissions: navigate to your Azure Monitor workspace in Azure portal and create role assignment for yourself to grant 'Monitoring Data Reader' role on the workspace resource.

Generate sample traffic: send a few requests to the product page created earlier, for example:

`curl -s "http://${GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL}/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"`

View/Query metrics in Azure portal: navigate to Prometheus explorer under your Azure Monitor workspace and

[query metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-workbooks). The example below shows results for query`istio_requests_total`

.

## Delete resources

If you want to clean up the Istio service mesh and the ingresses (leaving behind the cluster), run the following command:

```
az aks mesh disable --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


If you want to clean up all the resources created from the Istio how-to guidance documents, run the following command:

```
az group delete --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --yes --no-wait
```

# Node resource reservations in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this article, you learn about node resource reservations in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Resource reservations

AKS uses node resources to help the nodes function as part of the cluster. This usage can cause a discrepancy between the node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS.

AKS reserves two types of resources, **CPU** and **memory**, on each node to maintain node performance and functionality. As a node grows larger in resources, the resource reservations also grow due to a higher need for management of user-deployed pods. Keep in mind that you can't change resource reservations on a node.

### CPU reservations

Reserved CPU is dependent on node type and cluster configuration, which might result in less allocatable CPU due to running extra features. The following table shows CPU reservations in millicores:

| CPU cores on host | 1 core | 2 cores | 4 cores | 8 cores | 16 cores | 32 cores | 64 cores |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kube-reserved CPU (millicores) | 60 | 100 | 140 | 180 | 260 | 420 | 740 |

### Memory reservations

In AKS, reserved memory consists of the sum of two values:

**AKS 1.29 and later**

has the`kubelet`

daemon*memory.available < 100 Mi*eviction rule by default. This rule ensures that a node has at least 100 Mi allocatable at all times. When a host is below that available memory threshold, the`kubelet`

triggers the termination of one of the running pods and frees up memory on the host machine.**A rate of memory reservations**set according to the lesser value of:*20 MB * Max Pods supported on the Node + 50 MB*or*25% of the total system memory resources*.**Examples**:- If the virtual machine (VM) provides 8 GB of memory and the node supports up to 30 pods, AKS reserves
*20 MB * 30 Max Pods + 50 MB = 650 MB*for kube-reserved.`Allocatable space = 8 GB - 0.65 GB (kube-reserved) - 0.1 GB (eviction threshold) = 7.25 GB or 90.625% allocatable.`

- If the VM provides 4 GB of memory and the node supports up to 70 pods, AKS reserves
*25% * 4 GB = 1000 MB*for kube-reserved, as this is less than*20 MB * 70 Max Pods + 50 MB = 1450 MB*.

For more information, see

[Configure maximum pods per node in an AKS cluster](concepts-network-ip-address-planning#maximum-pods-per-node).- If the virtual machine (VM) provides 8 GB of memory and the node supports up to 30 pods, AKS reserves

**AKS versions prior to 1.29**

has the`kubelet`

daemon*memory.available < 750 Mi*eviction rule by default. This rule ensures that a node has at least 750 Mi allocatable at all times. When a host is below that available memory threshold, the`kubelet`

triggers the termination of one of the running pods and free up memory on the host machine.**A regressive rate of memory reservations**for the kubelet daemon to properly function (*kube-reserved*).- 25% of the first 4 GB of memory
- 20% of the next 4 GB of memory (up to 8 GB)
- 10% of the next 8 GB of memory (up to 16 GB)
- 6% of the next 112 GB of memory (up to 128 GB)
- 2% of any memory more than 128 GB


Note

AKS reserves an extra 2 GB for system processes in Windows nodes that isn't part of the calculated memory.

Memory and CPU allocation rules are designed to:

- Keep agent nodes healthy, including some hosting system pods critical to cluster health.
- Cause the node to report less allocatable memory and CPU than it would report if it weren't part of a Kubernetes cluster.

For example, if a node offers 7 GB, it reports 34% of memory not allocatable including the 750 Mi hard eviction threshold.

`0.75 + (0.25*4) + (0.20*3) = 0.75 GB + 1 GB + 0.6 GB = 2.35 GB / 7 GB = 33.57% reserved`


In addition to reservations for Kubernetes itself, the underlying node OS also reserves an amount of CPU and memory resources to maintain OS functions.
