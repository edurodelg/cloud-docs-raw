# Scaling options for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When running applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to actively increase or decrease the amount of compute resources in your cluster. As you change the number of application instances you have, you might need to change the number of underlying Kubernetes nodes. You might also need to provision a large number of other application instances.

This article introduces core AKS application scaling concepts, including [manually scaling pods or nodes](#manually-scale-pods-or-nodes), using the [Horizontal pod autoscaler](#horizontal-pod-autoscaler), using the [Cluster autoscaler](#cluster-autoscaler), and integrating with [Azure Container Instances (ACI)](#burst-to-azure-container-instances-aci).

## Manually scale pods or nodes

You can manually scale replicas, or pods, and nodes to test how your application responds to a change in available resources and state. Manually scaling resources lets you define a set amount of resources to use, such as the number of nodes, to maintain a fixed cost. To manually scale, you define a replica or node count. The Kubernetes API then schedules the creation of more pods or the draining of nodes based on that replica or node count.

When you scale down nodes, the Kubernetes API calls the relevant Azure Compute API tied to the compute type used by your cluster. For example, for clusters built on Virtual Machine Scale Sets, the Virtual Machine Scale Sets API determines which nodes to remove. To learn more about how nodes are selected for removal on scale down, see the [Virtual Machine Scale Sets FAQ](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-faq#if-i-reduce-my-scale-set-capacity-from-20-to-15--which-vms-are-removed-).

To get started with manually scaling nodes, see [manually scale nodes in an AKS cluster](scale-cluster). To manually scale the number of pods, see [kubectl scale command](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_scale/).

## Horizontal pod autoscaler

Kubernetes uses the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to monitor the resource demand and automatically scale the number of pods. By default, the HPA checks the Metrics API every 15 seconds for any required changes in replica count, while the Metrics API retrieves data from the Kubelet every 60 seconds. As a result, HPA is updated every 60 seconds. When changes are required, the number of replicas is scaled accordingly. HPA works with AKS clusters that have deployed Metrics Server for Kubernetes version 1.8 and higher.

When you configure the HPA for a given deployment, you define the minimum and maximum number of replicas that can run. You also define the metric to monitor and base scaling decisions on, such as CPU usage.

To get started with the horizontal pod autoscaler in AKS, see [Autoscale pods in AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-scale#autoscale-pods).

### Cooldown of scaling events

As the HPA is effectively updated every 60 seconds, previous scale events might not have successfully completed before another check is made. This behavior could cause the HPA to change the number of replicas before the previous scale event could receive application workload and the resource demands to adjust accordingly.

To minimize race events, a delay value is set. This value defines how long the HPA must wait after a scale event before another scale event can be triggered. This behavior allows the new replica count to take effect and the Metrics API to reflect the distributed workload. There's [no delay for scale-up events as of Kubernetes 1.12](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-cooldown-delay). However, the default delay on scale down events is *5 minutes*.

## Cluster autoscaler

To respond to changing pod demands, the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes based on the requested compute resources in the node pool. By default, the cluster autoscaler checks the Metrics API server every 10 seconds for any required changes in node count. If the cluster autoscaler determines that a change is required, the number of nodes in your AKS cluster is increased or decreased accordingly. The cluster autoscaler works with Kubernetes RBAC-enabled AKS clusters that run Kubernetes 1.10.x or higher.

The cluster autoscaler is typically used alongside the [horizontal pod autoscaler](#horizontal-pod-autoscaler). When combined, the horizontal pod autoscaler increases or decreases the number of pods based on application demand, and the cluster autoscaler adjusts the number of nodes to run more pods.

To get started with the cluster autoscaler in AKS, see [Cluster autoscaler on AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

### Scale out events

If a node doesn't have sufficient compute resources to run a requested pod, that pod can't progress through the scheduling process. The pod can't start unless more compute resources are made available within the node pool.

When the cluster autoscaler notices pods that can't be scheduled because of node pool resource constraints, the number of nodes within the node pool is increased to provide extra compute resources. When the nodes are successfully deployed and available for use within the node pool, the pods are then scheduled to run on them.

If your application needs to scale rapidly, some pods might remain in a state of waiting to be scheduled until more nodes deployed by the cluster autoscaler can accept the scheduled pods. For applications that have high burst demands, you can scale with virtual nodes and [Azure Container Instances](#burst-to-azure-container-instances-aci).

### Scale in events

The cluster autoscaler also monitors the pod scheduling status for nodes that haven't recently received new scheduling requests. This scenario indicates the node pool has more compute resources than required, and the number of nodes can be decreased. By default, nodes that pass a threshold of no longer being needed for 10 minutes are scheduled for deletion. When this situation occurs, pods are scheduled to run on other nodes within the node pool, and the cluster autoscaler decreases the number of nodes.

Your applications might experience some disruption as pods are scheduled on different nodes when the cluster autoscaler decreases the number of nodes. To minimize disruption, avoid applications that use a single pod instance.

## Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA)

[Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling](https://keda.sh/docs/2.13/concepts/) (KEDA) is an open source component for event-driven autoscaling of workloads. It scales workloads dynamically based on the number of events received. KEDA extends Kubernetes with a custom resource definition (CRD), referred to as a *ScaledObject*, to describe how applications should be scaled in response to specific traffic.

KEDA scaling is useful in scenarios where workloads receive bursts of traffic or handle high volumes of data. KEDA differs from the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler as KEDA is event-driven and scales based on the number of events, while HPA is metrics-driven based on the resource utilization (for example, CPU and memory).

To get started with the KEDA add-on in AKS, see [KEDA overview](keda-about).

## Node Autoprovisioning

[Node autoprovisioning (preview)](node-autoprovision) (NAP), uses the open source Karpenter project that automatically deploys, configures, and manages [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) on your AKS cluster. NAP dynamically provisions nodes based on pending pod resource requirements; it'll automatically select the optimal virtual machine (VM) SKU and quantity to meet real-time demand.

NAP takes a predefined list of VM SKUs as the starting point to decide which SKU is best suited for pending workloads. For more precise control, users can define the upper limits of resources used by a node pool and preferences of where workloads should be scheduled if there are multiple node pools.

## Control Plane Scaling and Safeguards

Kubernetes has a multi-dimensional scale envelope with each resource type representing a dimension. Not all resources are alike. For example, watches are commonly set on secrets, which result in list calls to the kube-apiserver that add cost and a disproportionately higher load on the control plane compared to resources without watches.

The control plane manages all the resource scaling in the cluster, so the more you scale the cluster within a given dimension, the less you can scale within other dimensions. For example, running hundreds of thousands of pods in an AKS cluster impacts how much pod churn rate (pod mutations per second) the control plane can support. Refer to ** best practices**.

AKS automatically scales control plane components based on key signals such as the total number of cores in the cluster and CPU or memory pressure on the control plane components.

To verify whether the control plane has scaled up, check the ConfigMap named 'large-cluster-control-plane-scaling-status'

```
kubectl describe configmap large-cluster-control-plane-scaling-status -n kube-system
```


### Control Plane Safeguards

If scaling the API server automatically does not stabilize it under high load scenarios, AKS deploys a managed API server guard. This guard acts as a last-resort mechanism to protect the API server by throttling non-system client requests and preventing the control plane from becoming completely unresponsive. System-critical calls to API server from components such as kubelet will continue to function normally.

To verify whether the managed API server guard has been applied, check for the presence of **"aks-managed-apiserver-guard"** FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration.

```
kubectl get flowschemas
kubectl get prioritylevelconfigurations
```


Refer to [API server and Etcd Troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/troubleshoot-apiserver-etcd#cause-4-aks-managed-api-server-guard-was-applied) if the **"aks-managed-apiserver-guard"** FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration have been applied on the cluster for quick mitigation.

## Burst to Azure Container Instances (ACI)

To rapidly scale your AKS cluster, you can integrate with Azure Container Instances (ACI). Kubernetes has built-in components to scale the replica and node count. However, if your application needs to rapidly scale, the [horizontal pod autoscaler](#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) might schedule more pods than what the existing compute resources in the node pool can support. If configured, this scenario would then trigger the [cluster autoscaler](#cluster-autoscaler) to deploy more nodes in the node pool, but it might take a few minutes for those nodes to successfully provision and allow the Kubernetes scheduler to run pods on them.

ACI lets you quickly deploy container instances without extra infrastructure overhead. When you connect with AKS, ACI becomes a secured, logical extension of your AKS cluster. The [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) component, which is based on [virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/), is installed in your AKS cluster that presents ACI as a virtual Kubernetes node. Kubernetes can then schedule pods that run as ACI instances through virtual nodes, not as pods on VM nodes directly in your AKS cluster.

Your application requires no modifications to use virtual nodes. Your deployments can scale across AKS and ACI and with no delay as the cluster autoscaler deploys new nodes in your AKS cluster.

Virtual nodes are deployed to another subnet in the same virtual network as your AKS cluster. This virtual network configuration secures the traffic between ACI and AKS. Like an AKS cluster, an ACI instance is a secure, logical compute resource isolated from other users.

Important

The [Kubernetes SIG Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-network/README.md) and the Security Response Committee [announced the upcoming retirement](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/) of the [Ingress NGINX project](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/), with maintenance ending in **March 2026**. There's no immediate action required today for AKS clusters using the [Application Routing add-on with NGINX](/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing). Microsoft will provide official support for critical security patches for Application Routing add-on NGINX Ingress resources through **November 2026**.

AKS is aligning with upstream Kubernetes by moving to ** Gateway API as the long-term standard for ingress and L7 traffic management**. We recommend you start planning your migration path based on your current setup:

**Application Routing add-on users**: Production workloads remain fully supported through November 2026. AKS will continue evolving the Application Routing add-on with Gateway API alignment. You don't need to move to a different ingress product.**OSS NGINX users**have several options:- Migrate to the
[Application Routing add-on with NGINX](/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing)to benefit from official support through November 2026 while planning your long-term Gateway API migration. - Migrate to
[Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview), which supports both Ingress API and Gateway API.

- Migrate to the
**Service mesh users**: If you plan to adopt a service mesh, consider the[Istio-based service mesh add-on](/en-us/azure/aks/istio-about). Use Istio Ingress today, and plan to migrate to Istio Gateway API support when it becomes GA.

This article shows you how to configure an NGINX ingress controller to work with an Azure internal load balancer. It also explains how to configure a private Azure DNS zone to enable DNS resolution for the private endpoints to resolve specific domains.

## Before you begin

An AKS cluster with the

[application routing add-on](app-routing).To attach an Azure private DNS Zone, you need the

[Owner](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner),[Azure account administrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles), or[Azure coadministrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles)role on your Azure subscription.

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use `kubectl`

, the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl`

is already installed.

The following example configures connecting to your cluster named *aks-cluster* in the *test-rg* using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name aks-cluster
```


## Create a virtual network

To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, specify a list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone with [virtual network links](/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links).

The following example creates a virtual network named *vnet-1* in the *test-rg* resource group, and one subnet named *subnet-1* to create within the virtual network with a specific address prefix.

```
az network vnet create \
--name vnet-1 \
--resource-group test-rg \
--location eastus \
--address-prefix 10.2.0.0/16 \
--subnet-name subnet-1 \
--subnet-prefixes 10.2.0.0/24
```


## Create an Azure private DNS zone

Note

You can configure the application routing add-on to automatically create records on one or more Azure global and private DNS zones for hosts defined on ingress resources. All global Azure DNS zones and all private Azure DNS zones must be in the same resource group.

Create a DNS zone using the [az network private-dns zone create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/zone?#az-network-private-dns-zone-create) command, specifying the name of the zone and the resource group to create it in. The following example creates a DNS zone named *private.contoso.com* in the *test-rg* resource group.

```
az network private-dns zone create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name private.contoso.com
```


You create a virtual network link to the DNS zone created earlier using the [az network private-dns link vnet create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/link/vnet#az-network-private-dns-link-vnet-create) command. The following example creates a link named *dns-link* to the zone *private.contoso.com* for the virtual network *vnet-1*. Include the `--registration-enabled`

parameter to specify the link isn't registration enabled.

```
az network private-dns link vnet create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name dns-link \
--zone-name private.contoso.com \
--virtual-network vnet-1 \
--registration-enabled false
```


The Azure DNS private zone auto registration feature manages DNS records for virtual machines deployed in a virtual network. When you link a virtual network with a private DNS zone with this setting enabled, a DNS record gets created for each Azure virtual machine for your AKS node deployed in the virtual network.

## Attach an Azure private DNS zone to the application routing add-on

Note

The `az aks approuting zone add`

command uses the permissions of the user running the command to create the [Azure DNS Zone](/en-us/azure/dns/dns-protect-private-zones-recordsets) role assignment. The **Private DNS Zone Contributor** role is a built-in role for managing private DNS resources and is assigned to the add-on's managed identity. For more information on AKS managed identities, see [Summary of managed identities](managed-identity-overview#summary-of-managed-identities-used-by-aks).

Retrieve the resource ID for the DNS zone using the

command and set the output to a variable named`az network dns zone show`

`ZONEID`

. The following example queries the zone*private.contoso.com*in the resource group*test-rg*.`ZONEID=$(az network private-dns zone show \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name private.contoso.com \ --query "id" \ --output tsv)`

Update the add-on to enable integration with Azure DNS using the

command. You can pass a comma-separated list of DNS zone resource IDs. The following example updates the AKS cluster`az aks approuting zone`

*aks-cluster*in the resource group*test-rg*.`az aks approuting zone add \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name aks-cluster \ --ids=${ZONEID} \ --attach-zones`


## Create an NGINX ingress controller with a private IP address and an internal load balancer

The application routing add-on uses a Kubernetes [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) called [ NginxIngressController](https://aka.ms/aks/approuting/nginxingresscontrollercrd) to configure NGINX ingress controllers. You can create more ingress controllers or modify an existing configuration.

`NginxIngressController`

CRD has a `loadBalancerAnnotations`

field to control the behavior of the NGINX ingress controller's service by setting load balancer annotations. For more information about load balancer annotations, see [Customizations via Kubernetes annotations](configure-load-balancer-standard#customizations-via-kubernetes-annotations).

Perform the following steps to create an NGINX ingress controller with an internal facing Azure Load Balancer with a private IP address.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**nginx-internal-controller.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-internal spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal controllerNamePrefix: nginx-internal loadBalancerAnnotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-internal-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-internal created`

Verify the ingress controller was created

You can verify the status of the NGINX ingress controller using the

command.`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

The following example output shows the created resource. It might take a few minutes for the controller to be available:

`NAME INGRESSCLASS CONTROLLERNAMEPREFIX AVAILABLE default webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com nginx True nginx-internal nginx-internal nginx-internal True`


## Deploy an application

The application routing add-on uses annotations on Kubernetes Ingress objects to create the appropriate resources.

Create the application namespace called

`aks-store`

to run the example pods using the`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace aks-store`

Deploy the AKS store application using the following YAML manifest file:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/sample-manifests/docs/app-routing/aks-store-deployments-and-services.yaml -n aks-store`


This manifest creates the necessary deployments and services for the AKS store application.

## Create the Ingress resource that uses a host name on the Azure private DNS zone and a private IP address

Update ** host** with the name of your DNS host, for example,

**store-front.private.contoso.com**. Verify you're specifying nginx-internal for the ingressClassName.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**ingress.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: store-front namespace: aks-store spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal rules: - host: store-front.private.contoso.com http: paths: - backend: service: name: store-front port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix`

Create the ingress resource using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n aks-store`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`ingress.networking.k8s.io/store-front created`


## Verify the managed Ingress was created

You can verify the managed Ingress was created using the [ kubectl get ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command.

```
kubectl get ingress -n aks-store
```


The following example output shows the created managed Ingress:

```
NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
store-front nginx-internal store-front.private.contoso.com 80 10s
```


## Verify the Azure private DNS zone was updated

In a few minutes, run the [az network private-dns record-set a list](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/record-set/a#az-network-private-dns-record-set-a-list) command to view the A records for your Azure private DNS zone. Specify the name of the resource group and the name of the DNS zone. In this example, the resource group is *test-rg* and DNS zone is *private.contoso.com*.

```
az network private-dns record-set a list \
--resource-group test-rg \
--zone-name private.contoso.com
```


The following example output shows the created record:

```
[
{
"aRecords": [
{
"ipv4Address": "10.224.0.7"
}
],
"etag": "ecc303c5-4577-4ca2-b545-d34e160d1c2d",
"fqdn": "store-front.private.contoso.com.",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/private.contoso.com/A/store-front",
"isAutoRegistered": false,
"name": "store-front",
"resourceGroup": "test-rg",
"ttl": 300,
"type": "Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/A"
}
]
```

# Upgrade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node images

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) regularly provides new node images, so it's beneficial to upgrade your node images frequently to use the latest AKS features. Linux node images are updated weekly, and Windows node images are updated monthly. Image upgrade announcements are included in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases), and it can take up to a week for these updates to be rolled out across all regions. You can also perform node image upgrades automatically and schedule them using planned maintenance. For more information, see [Automatically upgrade node images](auto-upgrade-node-image).

This article shows you how to upgrade AKS cluster node images and how to update node pool images without upgrading the Kubernetes version. For information on upgrading the Kubernetes version for your cluster, see [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster).

Note

The AKS cluster must use virtual machine scale sets for the nodes.

It's not possible to downgrade a node image version (for example *AKSUbuntu-2204 to AKSUbuntu-1804*, or *AKSUbuntu-2204-202308.01.0 to AKSUbuntu-2204-202307.27.0*).

## Connect to your AKS cluster

Connect to your AKS cluster using the [

`az aks get-credentials`

][az-aks-get-credentials] command.`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER`


## Check for available node image upgrades

Check for available node image upgrades using the

command.`az aks nodepool get-upgrades`

`az aks nodepool get-upgrades \ --nodepool-name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP`

In the output, find and make note of the

`latestNodeImageVersion`

value. This value is the latest node image version available for your node pool.Check your current node image version to compare with the latest version using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --query nodeImageVersion`

If the

`nodeImageVersion`

value is different from the`latestNodeImageVersion`

, you can upgrade your node image.

## Upgrade all node images in all node pools

Upgrade all node images in all node pools in your cluster using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--node-image-only`

flag.`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --node-image-only \ --yes`

You can check the status of the node images using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.Note

This command might differ slightly depending on the shell you use. For more information on Windows and PowerShell environments, see the

[Kubernetes JSONPath documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/).`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

When the upgrade completes, use the

command to get the updated node pool details. The current node image is shown in the`az aks show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER`


## Upgrade a specific node pool

Update the OS image of a node pool without doing a Kubernetes cluster upgrade using the

command with the`az aks nodepool upgrade`

`--node-image-only`

flag.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --node-image-only`

You can check the status of the node images with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.Note

This command may differ slightly depending on the shell you use. For more information on Windows and PowerShell environments, see the

[Kubernetes JSONPath documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/).`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

When the upgrade completes, use the

command to get the updated node pool details. The current node image is shown in the`az aks nodepool show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL`


## Upgrade node images with node surge

To speed up the node image upgrade process, you can upgrade your node images using a customizable node surge value. By default, AKS uses one extra node to configure upgrades.

Upgrade node images with node surge using the

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--max-surge`

flag to configure the number of nodes used for upgrades.Note

To learn more about the trade-offs of various

`--max-surge`

settings, see[Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade).`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --max-surge 33% \ --no-wait`

You can check the status of the node images with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

Get the updated node pool details using the

command. The current node image is shown in the`az aks nodepool show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You may not need to continuously run your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads. For example, you may have a development cluster that you only use during business hours. This means there are times where your cluster might be idle, running nothing more than the system components. You can reduce the cluster footprint by [scaling all User node pools to 0](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0), but your

poolTo better optimize your costs during these periods, you can turn off, or stop, your cluster. This action stops your control plane and agent nodes, allowing you to save on all the compute costs, while maintaining all objects except standalone pods. The cluster state is stored for when you start it again, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

Caution

Stopping your cluster deallocates the control plane and releases the capacity. In regions experiencing capacity constraints, customers may be unable to start a stopped cluster. We do not recommend stopping mission critical workloads for this reason.

Note

AKS start operations will restore all objects from ETCD with the exception of standalone pods with the same names and ages. meaning that a pod's age will continue to be calculated from its original creation time. This count will keep increasing over time, regardless of whether the cluster is in a stopped state.

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### About the cluster stop/start feature

When using the cluster stop/start feature, the following conditions apply:

- This feature is only supported for Virtual Machine Scale Set backed clusters.
- You can't stop clusters which use the
[Node Autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision)feature. - The cluster state of a stopped AKS cluster is preserved for up to 12 months. If your cluster is stopped for more than 12 months, you can't recover the state. For more information, see the
[AKS support policies](support-policies). - You can only perform start or delete operations on a stopped AKS cluster. To perform other operations, like scaling or upgrading, you need to start your cluster first.
- If you provisioned PrivateEndpoints linked to private clusters, they need to be deleted and recreated again when starting a stopped AKS cluster.
- Because the stop process drains all nodes, any standalone pods (i.e. pods not managed by a Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, etc.) will be deleted.
- When you start your cluster back up, the following behavior is expected:
- The IP address of your API server may change.
- If you're using cluster autoscaler, when you start your cluster, your current node count may not be between the min and max range values you set. The cluster starts with the number of nodes it needs to run its workloads, which isn't impacted by your autoscaler settings. When your cluster performs scaling operations, the min and max values will impact your current node count, and your cluster will eventually enter and remain in that desired range until you stop your cluster.


## Stop an AKS cluster

Use the

command to stop a running AKS cluster, including the nodes and control plane. The following example stops a cluster named`az aks stop`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks stop --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has stopped using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows as`Stopped`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Stopped" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Stopping`

, your cluster hasn't fully stopped yet.

Important

If you're using [pod disruption budgets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/), the stop operation can take longer, as the drain process will take more time to complete.

## Start an AKS cluster

Caution

After utilizing the start/stop feature on AKS, it is essential to wait 15-30 minutes before restarting your AKS cluster. This waiting period is necessary because it takes several minutes for the relevant services to fully stop. Attempting to restart your cluster during this process can disrupt the shutdown process and potentially cause issues with the cluster or its workloads.

Use the

command to start a stopped AKS cluster. The cluster restarts with the previous control plane state and number of agent nodes. The following example starts a cluster named`az aks start`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks start --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has started using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows`Running`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Running" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Starting`

, your cluster hasn't fully started yet.

# Autoupgrade node OS images

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS provides multiple autoupgrade channels dedicated to timely node-level OS security updates. This channel is different from cluster-level Kubernetes version upgrades and supersedes it.

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## Interactions between node OS autoupgrade and cluster autoupgrade

Node-level OS security updates are released at a faster rate than Kubernetes patch or minor version updates. The node OS autoupgrade channel grants you flexibility and enables a customized strategy for node-level OS security updates. Then, you can choose a separate plan for cluster-level Kubernetes version [autoupgrades](auto-upgrade-cluster).
It's best to use both cluster-level [autoupgrades](auto-upgrade-cluster) and the node OS autoupgrade channel together. Scheduling can be fine-tuned by applying two separate sets of [maintenance windows](planned-maintenance) - `aksManagedAutoUpgradeSchedule`

for the cluster [autoupgrade](auto-upgrade-cluster) channel and `aksManagedNodeOSUpgradeSchedule`

for the node OS autoupgrade channel.

## Channels for node OS image upgrades

The selected channel determines the timing of upgrades. When making changes to node OS auto-upgrade channels, allow up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect.

Note

- Node OS image auto-upgrade don't affect the cluster's Kubernetes version.
- Starting with API version 2023-06-01, the default for any new AKS cluster is
`NodeImage`

.

### Node OS channel changes that cause a reimage

The following node os channel transitions will trigger reimage on the nodes:

| From | To |
|---|---|
| Unmanaged | None |
| Unspecified | Unmanaged |
| SecurityPatch | Unmanaged |
| NodeImage | Unmanaged |
| None | Unmanaged |

### Available node OS upgrade channels

The following upgrade channels are available. You're allowed to choose one of these options:

| Channel | Description | OS-specific behavior |
|---|---|---|
`None` |
Your nodes don't have security updates applied automatically. This means you're solely responsible for your security updates. | N/A |
`Unmanaged` |
The OS built-in patching infrastructure automatically applies OS updates. Newly allocated machines are initially unpatched. The OS's infrastructure patches them at some point. | Ubuntu and Azure Linux (CPU node pools) apply security patches through unattended upgrade/dnf-automatic roughly once per day around 06:00 UTC. Windows doesn't automatically apply security patches, so this option behaves equivalently to `None` . You need to manage the reboot process using a tool like
`Unmanaged` . |
`SecurityPatch` |
OS security patches, which are AKS-tested, fully managed, and applied with safe deployment practices. AKS regularly updates the node's virtual hard disk (VHD) with patches from the image maintainer labeled "security only." There might be disruptions when the security patches are applied to the nodes. However AKS is limiting disruptions by only reimaging your nodes only when necessary, such as for certain kernel security packages. When the patches are applied, the VHD is updated and existing machines are upgraded to that VHD, honoring maintenance windows and surge settings. If AKS decides that reimaging nodes isn't necessary, it patches nodes live without draining pods and performs no VHD update. This option incurs the extra cost of hosting the VHDs in your node resource group. If you use this channel, Linux
|

`SecurityPatch`

works on kubernetes patch versions that are deprecated, so long as the minor Kubernetes version is still supported. [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks)and[Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard)do not support`SecurityPatch`

.`NodeImage`

[unattended upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates)are disabled by default. Node image upgrades are supported as long as cluster Kubernetes minor version is still in support. Node images are AKS-tested, fully managed, and applied with safe deployment practices.## What to choose - SecurityPatch Channel or NodeImage Channel?

There are two important considerations for you to choose between `SecurityPatch`

or `NodeImage`

channels.

| Property | NodeImage Channel | SecurityPatch Channel | Recommended Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
`Speed of shipping` |
The typical build, test, release, and rollout timelines for a new VHD can take approximately two weeks following safe deployment practices. Although in the event of CVEs, accelerated rollouts can occur on a case by case basis. The exact timing when a new VHD hits a region can be monitored via
|

`NodeImage`

, even with safe deployment practices. SecurityPatch has the advantage of 'Live-patching' in Linux environments, where patching leads to selective 'reimaging' and doesn't reimage every time a patch gets applied. Re-image if it happens is controlled by maintenance windows.`SecurityPatch`

`Bugfixes`

`NodeImage`

## Set the node OS autoupgrade channel on a new cluster

- Set the node OS autoupgrade channel on a new cluster using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--node-os-upgrade-channel`

parameter. The following example sets the node OS autoupgrade channel to`SecurityPatch`

.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export AKS_CLUSTER="myAKSCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $AKS_CLUSTER \
--node-os-upgrade-channel SecurityPatch \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Set the node OS autoupgrade channel on an existing cluster

- Set the node os autoupgrade channel on an existing cluster using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--node-os-upgrade-channel`

parameter. The following example sets the node OS autoupgrade channel to`SecurityPatch`

.

```
az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --node-os-upgrade-channel SecurityPatch
```


Results:

```
{
"autoUpgradeProfile": {
"nodeOsUpgradeChannel": "SecurityPatch"
}
}
```


## Update ownership and schedule

The default cadence means there's no planned maintenance window applied.

| Channel | Updates Ownership | Default cadence |
|---|---|---|
`Unmanaged` |
OS driven security updates. AKS has no control over these updates. | Nightly around 6AM UTC for Ubuntu and Azure Linux. Monthly for Windows. |
`SecurityPatch` |
AKS-tested, fully managed, and applied with safe deployment practices. For more information, see
|

`NodeImage`

[AKS Node Images in Release tracker](release-tracker)Note

While Windows security updates are released on a monthly basis, using the `Unmanaged`

channel won't automatically apply these updates to Windows nodes. If you choose the `Unmanaged`

channel, you need to manage the reboot process for Windows nodes.

## Node channel known limitations

Currently, when you set the

[cluster autoupgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster)to`node-image`

, it also automatically sets the node OS autoupgrade channel to`NodeImage`

. You can't change node OS autoupgrade channel value if your cluster autoupgrade channel is`node-image`

. In order to set the node OS autoupgrade channel value, check the[cluster autoupgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster)value isn't`node-image`

.The

`SecurityPatch`

channel isn't supported on Windows OS node pools.

Note

Use CLI version 2.61.0 or above for the `SecurityPatch`

channel.

## Node OS planned maintenance windows

Planned maintenance for the node OS autoupgrade starts at your specified maintenance window.

Note

To ensure proper functionality, use a maintenance window of four hours or more.

For more information on Planned Maintenance, see [Use Planned Maintenance to schedule maintenance windows for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](planned-maintenance).

## Node OS autoupgrades FAQ

### How can I check the current nodeOsUpgradeChannel value on a cluster?

Run the `az aks show`

command and check the "autoUpgradeProfile" to determine what value the `nodeOsUpgradeChannel`

is set to:

```
az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --query "autoUpgradeProfile"
```


Results:

```
{
"nodeOsUpgradeChannel": "SecurityPatch"
}
```


### How can I monitor the status of node OS autoupgrades?

To view the status of your node OS auto upgrades, look up [activity logs](monitor-aks-reference) on your cluster. You can also look up specific upgrade-related events as mentioned in [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster). AKS also emits upgrade-related Event Grid events. To learn more, see [AKS as an Event Grid source](quickstart-event-grid).

### Can I change the node OS autoupgrade channel value if my cluster autoupgrade channel is set to `node-image`

?

No. Currently, when you set the [cluster autoupgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster) to `node-image`

, it also automatically sets the node OS autoupgrade channel to `NodeImage`

. You can't change the node OS autoupgrade channel value if your cluster autoupgrade channel is `node-image`

. In order to be able to change the node OS autoupgrade channel values, make sure the [cluster autoupgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster) isn't `node-image`

.

### Why is `SecurityPatch`

recommended over `Unmanaged`

channel?

On the `Unmanaged`

channel, AKS has no control over how and when the security updates are delivered. With `SecurityPatch`

, the security updates are fully tested and follow safe deployment practices. `SecurityPatch`

also honors maintenance windows. For more information, see [Increased security and resiliency of Canonical workloads on Azure](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/linux-and-open-source-blog/increased-security-and-resiliency-of-canonical-workloads-on/ba-p/3970623).

### Does `SecurityPatch`

always lead to a reimage of my nodes?

AKS limits reimages to only when necessary, such as certain kernel packages that may require a reimage to get fully applied. `SecurityPatch`

is designed to minimize disruptions as much as possible. If AKS decides reimaging nodes isn't necessary, it patches nodes live without draining pods and no VHD update is performed in such cases.

### Why does `SecurityPatch`

channel requires to reach `snapshot.ubuntu.com`

endpoint?

With the `SecurityPatch`

channel, the Linux cluster nodes have to download the required security patches and updates from ubuntu snapshot service described in [ubuntu-snapshots-on-azure-ensuring-predictability-and-consistency-in-cloud-deployments](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-snapshots-on-azure-ensuring-predictability-and-consistency-in-cloud-deployments).

### How do I know if a `SecurityPatch`

or `NodeImage`

upgrade is applied on my node?

Run the `kubectl get nodes --show-labels`

command to list the nodes in your cluster and their labels.

Among the returned labels, you should see a line similar to the following output:

```
kubernetes.azure.com/node-image-version=AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0-2024.12.01
```


Here, the base node image version is `AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202410.27.0`

. If applicable, the security patch version typically follows. In the above example, it's `2024.12.01`

.

The same details also be looked up in the Azure portal under the node label view:

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn about small and large language models, including when to use them and how you can use them with your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What are language models?

Language models are powerful machine learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and sentiment analysis. These models represent natural language based on the probability of words or sequences of words occurring in a given context.

*Conventional language models* have been used in supervised settings for research purposes where the models are trained on well-labeled text datasets for specific tasks. *Pre-trained language models* offer an accessible way to get started with AI and have become more widely used in recent years. These models are trained on large-scale text corpora from the internet using deep neural networks and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks.

The size of a language model is determined by its number of parameters, or *weights*, that determine how the model processes input data and generates output. Parameters are learned during the training process by adjusting the weights within layers of the model to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data. The more parameters a model has, the more complex and expressive it is, but also the more computationally expensive it is to train and use.

In general, **small language models** have *fewer than 10 billion parameters*, and **large language models** have *more than 10 billion parameters*. For example, the new Microsoft Phi-3 model family has three versions with different sizes: mini (3.8 billion parameters), small (7 billion parameters), and medium (14 billion parameters).

## When to use small language models

### Advantages

Small language models are a good choice if you want models that are:

**Faster and more cost-effective to train and run**: They require less data and compute power.**Easy to deploy and maintain**: They have smaller storage and memory footprints.**Less prone to**, which is when a model learns the noise or specific patterns of the training data and fails to generalize new data.*overfitting***Interpretable and explainable**: They have fewer parameters and components to understand and analyze.

### Use cases

Small language models are suitable for use cases that require:

**Limited data or resources**, and you need a quick and simple solution.**Well-defined or narrow tasks**, and you don't need much creativity in the output.**High-precision and low-recall tasks**, and you value accuracy and quality over coverage and quantity.**Sensitive or regulated tasks**, and you need to ensure the transparency and accountability of the model.

The following table lists some popular, high-performance small language models:

| Model family | Model sizes (Number of parameters) | Software license |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Phi-3 | Phi-3-mini (3.8 billion), Phi-3-small (7 billion) | MIT license |
| Microsoft Phi-2 | Phi-2 (2.7 billion) | MIT license |
| Falcon | Falcon-7B (7 billion) | Apache 2.0 license |

## When to use large language models

### Advantages

Large language models are a good choice if you want models that are:

**Powerful and expressive**: They can capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data.**General and adaptable**: They can handle a wider range of tasks and transfer knowledge across domains.**Robust and consistent**: They can handle noisy or incomplete inputs and avoid common errors and biases.

### Use cases

Large language models are suitable for use cases that require:

**Abundant data and resources**, and you have the budget to build and maintain a complex solution.**Low-precision and high-recall tasks**, and you value coverage and quantity over accuracy and quality.**Challenging or exploratory tasks**, and you want to leverage the model's capacity to learn and adapt.

The following table lists some popular, high-performance large language models:

| Model family | Model sizes (Number of parameters) | Software license |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Phi-3 | Phi-3-medium (14 billion) | MIT license |
| Falcon | Falcon-40B (40 billion) | Apache 2.0 license |

## Experiment with small and large language models on AKS

Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator (KAITO) is an open-source operator that automates small and large language model deployments in Kubernetes clusters. The KAITO add-on for AKS simplifies onboarding and reduces the time-to-inference for open-source models on your AKS clusters. The add-on automatically provisions right-sized GPU nodes and sets up the associated interference server as an endpoint server to your chosen model.

For more information, see [Deploy an AI model on AKS with the AI toolchain operator](ai-toolchain-operator). To get started with a range of supported small and large language models for your inference workflows, see the [KAITO model GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/kaito/tree/main/presets).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

# Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of cost optimized add-on scaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). With cost-optimized add-on scaling, you can manage add-ons that require custom CPU and memory by overriding default configurations or enabling autoscaling. This feature ensures that resources aren't overly allocated to add-on pods, improving cost savings and cluster efficiency.

## Overview

Enabling cost optimized add-on scaling installs the [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)add-on](vertical-pod-autoscaler), allowing supported add-ons to autoscale based on usage.

This feature also allows you to customize the resource's default CPU/ memory requests and limits in Deployments and DaemonSets, the maximum and minimum allowed CPU/ memory, and the VPA update mode within VPA custom resources. For more information, see [customize the resource configuration for AKS add-ons](customize-resource-configuration).

### Supported AKS add-ons

The following AKS managed add-ons support the cost optimized add-on scaling feature:

| Add-on | Enablement behavior | VPA custom resource name | Command to check VPA custom resource |
|---|---|---|---|
|

`coredns`

`kubectl get vpa coredns --namespace kube-system`

[Workload identity](workload-identity-deploy-cluster)`azure-wi-webhook-controller-manager`

`kubectl get vpa azure-wi-webhook-controller-manager --namespace kube-system`

[Image Integrity](image-integrity)`ratify`

`kubectl get vpa ratify --namespace gatekeeper-system`

[Network Observability (Retina)](container-network-observability-how-to)`retina-agent`

and `retina-operator`

`kubectl get vpa retina-agent --namespace kube-system`

and `kubectl get vpa retina-operator --namespace kube-system`

### Supported VPA modes for cost optimized add-on scaling

VPA currently supports the following modes for cost optimized add-on scaling:

*Off*: The VPA provides resource recommendation data but doesn't apply it to the target pod.*Initial*(default mode): The VPA automatically applies CPU and memory recommendations to the target pod when it restarts, but it doesn't initiate the restart itself.*Auto*: The VPA automatically updates CPU and memory requests for pods based on recommendations.

Note

When enabling cost optimized add-on scaling, consider the following information:

- If you delete the Deployment, DaemonSet, or VPA custom resource, the changes revert back to the AKS add-on's initial configuration.
- The cost optimized add-on scaling feature enables the
[VPA add-on](vertical-pod-autoscaler)to autoscale the supported AKS add-ons. It doesn't work with self-hosted VPA. - AKS restarts the add-on pods when enabling cost optimized add-on scaling. CoreDNS is currently the only exception to avoid potential disruptions during the restart. For more information, see
[CoreDNS autoscaling behavior](coredns-autoscale).

Warning

Make sure you have enough compute resources on the system node pool for your addons when you enable cost optimized add-on scaling. AKS recommends turning on the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) or [node autoprovision](node-autoprovision) to ensure right-sizing of your compute resources automatically.
Monitor for pending add-on pods when using the cost-optimized add-on scaling feature. VPA might recommend resource requests that exceed available node capacity, potentially leading to unschedulable pods. You can control this behavior by [customizing min/max values](customize-resource-configuration) for requests and limits of supported addons.

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster running Kubernetes version 1.25 or later.
- The Azure CLI version 2.60.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Install the](#install-the-aks-preview-azure-cli-extension)and`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension[register the cost optimized add-on scaling preview feature](#register-the-cost-optimized-add-on-scaling-preview-feature).

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using the`az extension add`

command.`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

`az extension update`

command.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the cost optimized add-on scaling preview feature

Register the cost optimized add-on scaling preview feature using the

`az feature register`

command.`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AKS-AddonAutoscalingPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show as

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

`az feature show`

command.`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AKS-AddonAutoscalingPreview"`

When the status shows as

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the Microsoft.ContainerService provider using the`az provider register`

command.`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on an AKS cluster

When enabling the add-on, the AKS cluster automatically installs the [VPA add-on](vertical-pod-autoscaler). The [AKS add-ons that support the cost optimized add-on scaling feature](#supported-aks-add-ons) have different enablement behavior.

Note

If you're using Bicep, ARM templates, or Terraform, set `VerticalPodAutoscaler`

to `"True"`

and `AddonAutoscaling`

to `"enabled"`

.

### Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on a new cluster

Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on a new AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-optimized-addon-scaling`

flag.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-optimized-addon-scaling`


### Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on an existing cluster

Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-optimized-addon-scaling`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-optimized-addon-scaling`


## Disable cost optimized add-on scaling on an AKS cluster

Disable cost optimized add-on scaling on an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-optimized-addon-scaling`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --disable-optimized-addon-scaling`


Note

Disabling the cost optimized add-on scaling feature doesn't disable the VPA add-on by default. To disable VPA, see [Disable VPA on an AKS cluster](use-vertical-pod-autoscaler#disable-the-vertical-pod-autoscaler-on-an-existing-cluster).

## Customize default resource configuration

With the cost optimized add-on scaling feature enabled on your cluster, you can customize the default CPU/memory settings for the add-on resources as well as the default VPA configuration for supported AKS add-ons. For more information, see [customize the resource configuration for AKS add-ons](customize-resource-configuration).

## Applying the VPA recommended values manually

Note

With *Initial* mode, the VPA applies the recommended CPU and memory requests only when a pod is created or updated. If you want the recommendations to take effect immediately, please update the pods manually. Before manually applying the recommended values, [make sure the VPA update mode is set to Initial or Auto in the VPA custom resource](customize-resource-configuration#customize-resource-update-mode).

Check the pod status and CPU/memory utilization to verify that the pod is running as expected.

The following example uses the

`kubectl get pod`

command to check a CoreDNS pod status:`kubectl get pod <coredns-pod-name> --namespace kube-system -o yaml`

The following output shows an example status of a CoreDNS pod:

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: <coredns-pod-name> namespace: kube-system spec: ... containers: - name: coredns resources: limits: cpu: "3" memory: "500Mi" requests: cpu: "100m" memory: "70Mi"`

Get the VPA recommended value using the

`kubectl get vpa`

command.`kubectl get vpa coredns --namespace kube-system`

The following output shows an example of the VPA recommended value for a CoreDNS pod:

`NAME MODE CPU MEM PROVIDED AGE coredns Initial 11m 23574998 True 44m`

If you want to use the values recommended by VPA, manually delete the pod using the

`kubectl delete pod`

command to restart the pod with the VPA recommended values.`kubectl delete pod <coredns-pod-name> --namespace kube-system`

After the pod restarts, verify the pod status and CPU/memory updates using the

`kubectl get pod`

command.`kubectl get pod <coredns-pod-name> --namespace kube-system -o yaml`

The following output shows an example status of a CoreDNS pod after applying the VPA recommended values:

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: <coredns-pod-name> namespace: kube-system spec: ... containers: - name: coredns resources: limits: cpu: "330m" memory: "168392842" requests: cpu: "11m" memory: "23574998"`


## Troubleshooting

With the cost optimized add-on scaling feature enabled on your cluster, you can customize the default CPU and memory settings for add-on resources, as well as modify the default VPA configuration for supported AKS managed add-ons

If your autoscaling enabled add-on pods are in a pending state, or you don't see any VPA recommendations for autoscaling enabled add-ons, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.

### Check AKS-managed VPA add-on status

Check if all VPA system components are running using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system | grep vpa`

The output should show three pods (vpa-admission-controller, vpa-recommender, and vpa-updater) running in the

`kube-system`

namespace, similar to the following example:`vpa-admission-controller 2/2 2 2 4m11s vpa-recommender 1/1 1 1 4m11s vpa-updater 1/1 1 1 4m11s`

For each of the three VPA pods, check the logs for any errors using the

`kubectl logs`

command. Make sure to replace`<pod-name>`

with the names of the VPA pods.`kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace kube-system | grep -e '^E[0-9]\{4\}'`

Confirm the custom resource definition (CRD) was creating using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get customresourcedefinition | grep verticalpodautoscalers`


### Check pod status and CPU/memory utilization

Check the pod's status using the

`kubectl get pod`

command.`kubectl get pod <pod-name> --namespace=kube-system`

If the pod has a status of

`Pending`

, check the pod's status property to determine the reason the pod isn't running.`kubectl describe pod <pod-name> --namespace kube-system -o yaml`

The following output shows an example status of a pod with a status of

`Pending`

:`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod ... status: conditions: - lastProbeTime: null lastTransitionTime: "2023-05-03T17:05:26Z" message: '0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu, 1 Insufficient memory. preemption: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient cpu, 1 Insufficient memory..' reason: Unschedulable status: "False" type: PodScheduled phase: Pending qosClass: Guaranteed`

If the output shows that the pod is

`Pending`

due to insufficient CPU or memory, consider the following actions:- Add more nodes so that pods can be scheduled in nodes with lower resource usage.
- Disable VPA for the target add-on pod by changing the update mode to
*Off*, and then[manually update the requests/limits](customize-resource-configuration)to the available resource values on the node. Be cautious when setting resource limits to extremely low values, as this may result in the pod encountering OOM kills or CPU throttling if it attempts to use more resources than are available on the node.


## Next steps

- Configure
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview)or[Node Autoprovisioning](node-autoprovision)in your cluster to automatically scale the cluster.

# Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Istio](https://istio.io/latest/) addresses the challenges developers and operators face with a distributed or microservices architecture. The Istio-based service mesh add-on provides an officially supported and tested integration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What is a Service Mesh?

Modern applications are typically architected as distributed collections of microservices, with each collection of microservices performing some discrete business function. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that you can add to your applications. It allows you to transparently add capabilities like observability, traffic management, and security, without adding them to your own code. The term **service mesh** describes both the type of software you use to implement this pattern, and the security or network domain that is created when you use that software.

As the deployment of distributed services, such as in a Kubernetes-based system, grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage. You may need to implement capabilities such as discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh can also address more complex operational requirements like A/B testing, canary deployments, rate limiting, access control, encryption, and end-to-end authentication.

Service-to-service communication is what makes a distributed application possible. Routing this communication, both within and across application clusters, becomes increasingly complex as the number of services grow. Istio helps reduce this complexity while easing the strain on development teams.

## What is Istio?

Istio is an open-source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications. Istio’s powerful features provide a uniform and more efficient way to secure, connect, and monitor services. Istio enables load balancing, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring – with few or no service code changes. Its powerful control plane brings vital features, including:

- Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption, strong identity-based authentication, and authorization.
- Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.
- Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection.
- A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits, and quotas.
- Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.

## How is the add-on different from open-source Istio?

This service mesh add-on uses and builds on top of open-source Istio. The add-on flavor provides the following extra benefits:

- Istio versions are tested and verified to be compatible with supported versions of Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Microsoft handles scaling and configuration of Istio control plane
- Microsoft adjusts scaling of AKS components like
`coredns`

when Istio is enabled. - Microsoft provides managed lifecycle (upgrades) for Istio components when triggered by user.
- Verified external and internal ingress set-up.
- Verified to work with
[Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)and[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview). - Official Azure support provided for the add-on.

## Limitations

Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS has the following limitations:

- The add-on doesn't work on AKS clusters that are using
[Open Service Mesh addon for AKS](open-service-mesh-about). - The add-on doesn't work on AKS clusters with self-managed installations of Istio.
- The add-on doesn't support adding pods associated with virtual nodes to be added under the mesh.
- The add-on doesn't yet support the sidecar-less Ambient mode. Microsoft is currently contributing to Ambient workstream under Istio open source. Product integration for Ambient mode is on the roadmap and is being continuously evaluated as the Ambient workstream evolves.
- The add-on doesn't yet support multi-cluster deployments.
- The add-on doesn't yet support Windows Server containers. Windows Server containers aren't yet supported in open source Istio right now. Issue tracking this feature ask can be found
[here](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27893). - Customization of mesh through the following custom resources is currently blocked -
`ProxyConfig, WorkloadEntry, WorkloadGroup, IstioOperator, WasmPlugin`

. - While the add-on allows the use of
`EnvoyFilter`

's, issues arising from them (for example from the Lua script or from the compression library) are outside the support scope of the Istio add-on. See the[support policy document](istio-support-policy#allowed-supported-and-blocked-customizations)for more information about the support categories for Istio add-on features and configuration options. - Gateway API for Istio ingress gateway or managing mesh traffic (GAMMA) is currently not yet supported with Istio add-on. However, Gateway API for Istio ingress traffic management is currently under active development for the add-on. While the add-on supports
[annotation and](istio-deploy-ingress#ingress-gateway-service-customizations), port or protocol configuration is currently not supported.`externalTrafficPolicy`

customization for the Istio ingress gateways - The add-on supports customization of a subset of the fields in
[MeshConfig](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/). Other customizations may be allowed but unsupported or disallowed entirely, as detailed[here](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values).

## Feedback and feature ask

Feedback and feature ask for the Istio add-on can be provided by creating [issues with label 'service-mesh' on AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aservice-mesh).

# Use proximity placement groups to reduce latency for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Note

When using proximity placement groups on AKS, colocation only applies to the agent nodes. Node to node and the corresponding hosted pod to pod latency is improved. The colocation doesn't affect the placement of a cluster's control plane.

When deploying your application in Azure, you can create network latency by spreading virtual machine (VM) instances across regions or availability zones, which may impact the overall performance of your application. A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure Azure compute resources are physically located close to one another. Some applications, such as gaming, engineering simulations, and high-frequency trading (HFT) require low latency and tasks that can complete quickly. For similar high-performance computing (HPC) scenarios, consider using [proximity placement groups (PPG)](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/co-location#proximity-placement-groups) for your cluster's node pools.

## Before you begin

This article requires Azure CLI version 2.14 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Limitations

- A proximity placement group can map to only
*one*availability zone. - A node pool must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets to associate a proximity placement group.
- A node pool can associate a proximity placement group at node pool create time only.

## Node pools and proximity placement groups

The first resource you deploy with a proximity placement group attaches to a specific data center. Any extra resources you deploy with the same proximity placement group are colocated in the same data center. Once all resources using the proximity placement group are stopped (deallocated) or deleted, it's no longer attached.

- You can associate multiple node pools with a single proximity placement group.
- You can only associate a node pool with a single proximity placement group.

### Configure proximity placement groups with availability zones

Note

While proximity placement groups require a node pool to use only *one* availability zone, the [baseline Azure VM SLA of 99.9%](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/virtual-machines/v1_9/) is still in effect for VMs in a single zone.

Proximity placement groups are a node pool concept and associated with each individual node pool. Using a PPG resource has no impact on AKS control plane availability, which can impact how you should design your cluster with zones. To ensure a cluster is spread across multiple zones, we recommend using the following design:

- Provision a cluster with the first system pool using
*three*zones and no proximity placement group associated to ensure the system pods land in a dedicated node pool, which spreads across multiple zones. - Add extra user node pools with a unique zone and proximity placement group associated to each pool. An example is
*nodepool1*in zone one and PPG1,*nodepool2*in zone two and PPG2, and*nodepool3*in zone 3 with PPG3. This configuration ensures that, at a cluster level, nodes are spread across multiple zones and each individual node pool is colocated in the designated zone with a dedicated PPG resource.

## Create a new AKS cluster with a proximity placement group

Accelerated networking greatly improves networking performance of virtual machines. Ideally, use proximity placement groups with accelerated networking. By default, AKS uses accelerated networking on [supported virtual machine instances](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-overview?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json#limitations-and-constraints), which include most Azure virtual machine with two or more vCPUs.

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location centralus`

Create a proximity placement group using the

command. Make sure to note the ID value in the output.`az ppg create`

`az ppg create --name myPPG --resource-group myResourceGroup --location centralus --type standard`

The command produces an output similar to the following example output, which includes the

*ID*value you need for upcoming CLI commands.`{ "availabilitySets": null, "colocationStatus": null, "id": "/subscriptions/yourSubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/proximityPlacementGroups/myPPG", "location": "centralus", "name": "myPPG", "proximityPlacementGroupType": "Standard", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", "tags": {}, "type": "Microsoft.Compute/proximityPlacementGroups", "virtualMachineScaleSets": null, "virtualMachines": null }`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and replace the`az aks create`

*myPPGResourceID*value with your proximity placement group resource ID from the previous step.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --ppg myPPGResourceID --generate-ssh-keys`


## Add a proximity placement group to an existing cluster

You can add a proximity placement group to an existing cluster by creating a new node pool. You can then optionally migrate existing workloads to the new node pool and delete the original node pool.

Use the same proximity placement group that you created earlier to ensure agent nodes in both node pools in your AKS cluster are physically located in the same data center.

Create a new node pool using the

command and replace the`az aks nodepool add`

*myPPGResourceID*value with your proximity placement group resource ID.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name mynodepool \ --node-count 1 \ --ppg myPPGResourceID`


## Clean up

Delete the Azure resource group along with its resources using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait`

# Use kubelogin to authenticate users in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The kubelogin plugin in Azure is a client-go credential [plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) that implements Microsoft Entra authentication. The kubelogin plugin offers features that aren't available in the kubectl command-line tool. For more information, see the [kubelogin introduction](https://azure.github.io/kubelogin/index.html) and the [kubectl introduction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/introduction/).

This article provides an overview and examples of how to use kubelogin for all supported Microsoft Entra authentication methods in AKS.

## Kubelogin authentication in AKS limitations

- Groups that are created in Microsoft Entra are included only by their
**ObjectID**value, and not by their display name. The`sAMAccountName`

command is available only for groups that are synchronized from on-premises Windows Server Active Directory.

- The service principal authentication method works only with managed Microsoft Entra, and not with the earlier version Azure Active Directory.
- The service principal can be a member of a maximum of 200
[Microsoft Entra groups](/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims). If you have more than 200 groups, consider using[application roles](/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-use-app-roles-customers).

- The device code authentication method doesn't work when a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy is set on a Microsoft Entra tenant. In that scenario, use web browser interactive authentication instead.

- The Azure CLI authentication method works only with AKS managed Microsoft Entra.

## How authentication works

Note

Keep in mind the following information about kubelogin authentication for AKS clusters integrated with Microsoft Entra:

**Clusters running Kubernetes version 1.24 or later**automatically use the kubelogin format.**Clusters running Kubernetes 1.24 or earlier**require manual conversion. You can use the device code authentication method to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin format.

For most interactions with kubelogin, you use the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand. The subcommand uses the kubeconfig file that's specified in `--kubeconfig`

or in the `KUBECONFIG`

environment variable to convert the final kubeconfig file to exec format based on the specified authentication method.

The authentication methods that kubelogin implements are Microsoft Entra OAuth 2.0 token grant flows. In each authentication method, the token isn't cached on the file system.

## Device code authentication

Device code is the default authentication method for the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand. This authentication method prompts the device code for the user to sign in from a browser session.

Note

Before the kubelogin and exec plugins were introduced, the Azure authentication method in kubectl supported only the device code flow. It used an earlier version of a library that produces a token that has the `audience`

claim with an `spn:`

prefix. It isn't compatible with [AKS managed Microsoft Entra](managed-azure-ad), which uses an [on-behalf-of (OBO)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) flow. When you run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand, kubelogin removes the `spn:`

prefix from the audience claim.

### Parameters for device code authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with device code authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l devicecode` (optional) |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. This parameter is optional because device code is the default method. |
`--legacy` |
Uses legacy behavior for earlier versions of Azure Active Directory clusters. If you're using the kubeconfig file in an earlier version Azure Active Directory cluster, kubelogin automatically adds the `--legacy` flag. |
`--token-cache-dir` |
Overrides the default path of the token cache directory, which is ${HOME}/.kube/cache/kubelogin. |

## Azure CLI authentication

The Azure CLI (command: `-l azurecli`

) authentication method uses the signed-in context that the Azure CLI establishes to get the access token. The token is issued in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as `az login`

. kubelogin doesn't write tokens to the token cache file because the Azure CLI already manages them.

### Parameters for Azure CLI authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with Azure CLI authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l azurecli` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--azure-config-dir` |
Specifies the Azure CLI configuration directory. The default directory is ${HOME}/.azure. |

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to Azure using the [ az login](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively#interactive-login) command.

```
az login
```


## Web browser interactive authentication

The web browser interactive (command: `-l interactive`

) method of authentication automatically opens a web browser to sign in the user. After the user is authenticated, the browser redirects to the local web server using the verified credentials. This authentication method complies with Conditional Access policy.

You can use either a bearer token or a Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token with this authentication method.

### Parameters for bearer token authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with bearer token authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l interactive` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--token-cache-dir` |
Overrides the default path of the token cache directory, which is ${HOME}/.kube/cache/kubelogin. |

### Parameters for PoP token authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with PoP token authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l interactive` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--pop-enabled` |
Enables PoP token authentication. |
`--pop-claims` |
Specifies the PoP token claims in a key-value pair format. For example, `u=/ARM/ID/OF/CLUSTER` . |

## Service principal authentication

The service principal (command: `-l spn`

) authentication method uses a service principal to sign in the user. You can provide the credential by setting an environment variable or by using the credential in a command-line argument. The supported credentials that you can use are a password or a Personal Information Exchange (PFX) client certificate.

### Parameters for service principal authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with service principal authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l spn` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--client-id` |
The application ID (client-id) of the service principal. |
`--client-secret` |
The client secret of the service principal. |

## Managed identity authentication

Use the [managed identity](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) (command: `-l msi`

) authentication method for applications that connect to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Examples include accessing Azure resources like an Azure virtual machine (VM), a virtual machine scale set, or Azure Cloud Shell.

You can use the default managed identity that's assigned to the resource or a specific user-assigned managed identity.

### Parameters for managed identity authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with managed identity authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l msi` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--client-id` |
The application ID (client-id) of the user-assigned managed identity. If you don't specify this parameter, the default managed identity is used. |

## Workload identity authentication

The workload identity (command: `-l workloadidentity`

) authentication method uses identity credentials that are federated with Microsoft Entra to authenticate access to AKS clusters. The method uses Microsoft Entra integrated authentication. It works by setting the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID` |
The Microsoft Entra application ID that is federated with the workload identity. |
`AZURE_TENANT_ID` |
The Microsoft Entra tenant ID. |
`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` |
The file that contains a signed assertion of the workload identity, like a Kubernetes projected service account (JWT) token. |
`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST` |
The base URL of a Microsoft Entra authority. For example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` . |

You can use a [workload identity](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-overview) to access Kubernetes clusters from CI/CD systems like GitHub or ArgoCD without storing service principal credentials in the external systems. To configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation from GitHub, see the [OIDC federation example](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure).

### Parameters for workload identity authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with workload identity authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l workloadidentity` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |

## Export the kubeconfig file path

Before you run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand, export the kubeconfig file path to the `KUBECONFIG`

environment variable. For example:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
```


## Convert the kubeconfig file

Run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin for your chosen authentication method.

```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig
```


```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli
```


```
# Bearer token authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l interactive
# Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l interactive --pop-enabled --pop-claims "u=/ARM/ID/OF/CLUSTER"
```


-
[Use environment variables](#tabpanel_1_environment-variables) -
[Use command-line arguments](#tabpanel_1_command-line-arguments) -
[Use a client certificate](#tabpanel_1_client-certificate) -
[Use a PoP token with environment variables](#tabpanel_1_pop-token-environment-variables)

Run the

`convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin.`kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l spn`

Set the environment variables for the client ID and client secret or client certificate. For example:

`export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service-principal-client-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<service-principal-client-secret>`


```
# Default managed identity authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l msi
# Specific managed identity authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l msi --client-id <managed-identity-client-id>
```


```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l workloadidentity
```


## Remove cached tokens

Remove cached tokens using the `kubelogin remove-tokens`

command.

```
kubelogin remove-tokens
```


## Get node information

Get node information using the `kubectl get`

command.

```
kubectl get nodes
```


## How to use kubelogin with AKS

AKS uses a pair of first-party Microsoft Entra applications. These application IDs are the same in all environments.

The AKS Microsoft Entra server application ID (server-id) that the server side uses is `6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630`

. The access token that accesses AKS clusters must be issued for this application. In most kubelogin authentication methods, you must use `--server-id`

with `kubelogin get-token`

.

The AKS Microsoft Entra client application ID (client-id) that kubelogin uses to perform public client authentication on behalf of the user is `80faf920-1908-4b52-b5ef-a8e7bedfc67a`

. The client application ID is used in device code and web browser interactive authentication methods.

# Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium combines the robust control plane of Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) with the data plane of [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) to provide high-performance networking and security.

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium provides the following benefits by making use of eBPF programs loaded into the Linux kernel and a more efficient API object structure:

- Functionality equivalent to existing Azure CNI and Azure CNI Overlay plugins
- Improved service routing
- More efficient network policy enforcement
- Better observability of cluster traffic
- Support for larger clusters (more nodes, pods, and services)

## IP Address Management (IPAM) with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

You can deploy Azure CNI Powered by Cilium with two different methods for assigning pod IPs:

- Assign IP addresses from an overlay network (similar to Azure CNI Overlay mode)
- Assign IP addresses from a virtual network (similar to existing Azure CNI with Dynamic Pod IP Assignment)

If you aren't sure which option to select, read [Choose a network model](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay#choose-a-network-model)

## Versions

| Kubernetes Version | Minimum Cilium Version |
|---|---|
| 1.29 (LTS) | 1.14.19 |
| 1.30 | 1.14.19 |
| 1.31 | 1.16.6 |
| 1.32 | 1.17.0 |
| 1.33 | 1.17.0 |

For more information on AKS versioning and release timelines, see [Supported Kubernetes Versions](supported-kubernetes-versions).

## Network Policy Enforcement

Cilium enforces [network policies to allow or deny traffic between pods](operator-best-practices-network#control-traffic-flow-with-network-policies). With Cilium, you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

## Local Redirect Policy (LRP)

LRP starts to be supported from Kubernetes v1.29 and up, Cilium v1.14 and up. For LRP to work with Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) - FQDN Filtering, the Cilium Network Policy egress labels need to match with node-local DNS cache pod labels.

## Limitations

Azure CNI powered by Cilium currently has the following limitations:

- Available only for Linux and not for Windows.
- Network policies can't use
`ipBlock`

to allow access to node or pod IPs. For details and recommended workarounds, see[frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions). - For Cilium versions 1.16 or earlier, multiple Kubernetes services can't use the same host port with different protocols (for example, TCP or UDP) (
[Cilium issue #14287](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/14287)). - Network policies aren't applied to pods using host networking (
`spec.hostNetwork: true`

) because these pods use the host identity instead of having individual identities. - Cilium Endpoint Slices are supported in Kubernetes version 1.32 and above. Cilium Endpoint Slices don't support configuration of how Cilium Endpoints are grouped. Priority namespace through
`cilium.io/ces-namespace`

isn't supported. - L7 policy isn't supported by
`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP). - Cilium uses Cilium identities as unique identity for provisioning endpoints, so high-churning workloads such as Spark jobs generate high count of Cilium identities. To avoid workloads hitting Cilium identity limits (65535), excluding Spark job's labels like
`!spark-app-name`

and`!spark-app-selector`

in the Cilium configmap can significantly reduce Cilium identity generation. For more details on Cilium identity exclusion rules, check[the official Cilium label documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/performance/scalability/identity-relevant-labels/#excluding-labels). - AKS Local DNS isn't compatible with Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) - FQDN Filtering.

## Considerations

To gain capabilities such as observability into your network traffic and security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) based filtering and Layer 7 based network policies on your cluster, consider enabling [Advanced Container Networking services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) on your clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.48.1 or later. Run
`az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using ARM templates or the REST API, the AKS API version must be
`2022-09-02-preview`

or later.

Previous AKS API versions (`2022-09-02preview`

to `2023-01-02preview`

) used the field [ networkProfile.ebpfDataplane=cilium](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2022-09-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L6939-L6955). AKS API versions since

`2023-02-02preview`

use the field [to enable Azure CNI Powered by Cilium.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2023-02-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L7152-L7173)

`networkProfile.networkDataplane=cilium`

## Create a new AKS Cluster with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

The following sections use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a cluster and assign IP addresses.

### Option 1: Assign IP addresses from an overlay network

Use the following commands to create a cluster with an overlay network and Cilium. Replace the values for `<clusterName>`

, `<resourceGroupName>`

, and `<location>`

:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


The `--network-dataplane cilium`

flag replaces the deprecated `--enable-ebpf-dataplane`

flag used in earlier versions of the aks-preview CLI extension.

### Option 2: Assign IP addresses from a virtual network

Run the following commands to create a resource group and virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods.

```
# Create the resource group
az group create --name <resourceGroupName> --location <location>
```


```
# Create a virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods
az network vnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --location <location> --name <vnetName> --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.0.0.0/8> -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name nodesubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.240.0.0/16> -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name podsubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.241.0.0/16> -o none
```


Create the cluster using `--network-dataplane cilium`

:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--max-pods 250 \
--network-plugin azure \
--vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/nodesubnet \
--pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/podsubnet \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Option 3: Assign IP addresses from the Node Subnet

Azure CLI version 2.69.0 or later is required. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Create a cluster using [node subnet](concepts-network-legacy-cni#azure-cni-node-subnet) with a Cilium data plane:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Frequently asked questions

**Can I customize Cilium configuration?**No, AKS manages the Cilium configuration and it can't be modified. We recommend that customers who require more control use

[AKS BYO CNI](use-byo-cni)and install Cilium manually.**Can I use**`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

custom resources instead of Kubernetes`NetworkPolicy`

resources?L3 and L4

`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

are supported and can be used alongside Kubernetes`NetworkPolicy`

resources.Customers might use FQDN filtering and Layer 7 policies as part of the

[Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview)feature bundle.**Can I use**`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

?Yes,

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

is supported. The following sample policy YAML shows configuring an L4 rule:`apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2" kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy metadata: name: "l4-rule-ingress-backend-frontend" spec: endpointSelector: matchLabels: role: backend ingress: - fromEndpoints: - matchLabels: role: frontend toPorts: - ports: - port: "80" protocol: TCP`

**Which Cilium features are supported in Azure managed CNI? Which of those require Advanced Container Networking Services?**Supported Feature w/o ACNS w/ ACNS Cilium Endpoint Slices ✔️ ✔️ K8s Network Policies ✔️ ✔️ Cilium L3/L4 Network Policies ✔️ ✔️ Cilium Clusterwide Network Policy ✔️ ✔️ FQDN Filtering ❌ ✔️ L7 Network Policies (HTTP/gRPC/Kafka) ❌ ✔️ Container Network Observability (Metrics and Flow logs) ❌ ✔️ eBPF Host Routing ❌ ✔️ **Why is traffic being blocked when the**`NetworkPolicy`

has an`ipBlock`

that allows the IP address?A limitation of Azure CNI Powered by Cilium is that a

`NetworkPolicy`

`ipBlock`

can't select pod or node IPs.For example, this

`NetworkPolicy`

has an`ipBlock`

that allows all egress to`0.0.0.0/0`

:`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: example-ipblock spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - ipBlock: cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 # This will still block pod and node IPs.`

However, when this

`NetworkPolicy`

is applied, Cilium blocks egress to pod and node IPs even though the IPs are within the`ipBlock`

CIDR.As a workaround, you can add

`namespaceSelector`

and`podSelector`

to select pods. This example selects all pods in all namespaces:`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: example-ipblock spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - ipBlock: cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 - namespaceSelector: {} - podSelector: {}`

It isn't currently possible to specify a

`NetworkPolicy`

with an`ipBlock`

to allow traffic to node IPs.**Does AKS configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium**`daemonset`

?No, AKS doesn't configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium

`daemonset`

because Cilium is a critical system component for pod networking and network policy enforcement.**Does Azure CNI powered by Cilium use kube-proxy?**No, AKS clusters created with network data plane as Cilium don't use

`kube-proxy`

. If the AKS clusters are on[Azure CNI Overlay](azure-cni-overlay)or[Azure CNI with dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)and are upgraded to AKS clusters running Azure CNI powered by Cilium, new nodes workloads are created without`kube-proxy`

. Older workloads are also migrated to run without`kube-proxy`

as a part of this upgrade process.

## Dual-stack networking with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

You can deploy your dual-stack AKS clusters with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium. This feature also allows you to control your IPv6 traffic with the Cilium Network Policy engine.

You must have Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater.

### Set up Overlay clusters with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

Create a cluster with Azure CNI Overlay using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command. Make sure to use the argument

`--network-dataplane cilium`

to specify the Cilium data plane.```
clusterName="myOverlayCluster"
resourceGroup="myResourceGroup"
location="westcentralus"
az aks create \
--name $clusterName \
--resource-group $resourceGroup \
--location $location \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--ip-families ipv4,ipv6 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of how to customize the resource configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed add-ons with [cost optimized add-on scaling (Preview)](optimized-addon-scaling).

## Overview

Enabling the cost optimized add-on scaling feature in your AKS cluster installs the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) add-on and VPA custom resources for AKS managed add-ons that support this capability. This feature also allows you to manually customize the resource CPU and memory requests and limits in Deployments and DaemonSets. You can also customize the maximum and minimum allowed CPU and memory and the VPA update mode within VPA custom resources.

## Prerequisites

- Review the
[supported AKS managed add-ons](optimized-addon-scaling#supported-aks-add-ons)and[limitations](optimized-addon-scaling)for this feature. - You need an AKS cluster enabled with the cost optimized add-on scaling feature. If you don't have one, see
[Enable cost optimized add-on scaling on your AKS cluster (Preview)](optimized-addon-scaling).

## Customize resource annotations

| Annotation | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|
`kubernetes.azure.com/override-requests-limits` |
Supports the capability to customize the container resource CPU/memory requests/limits in a Deployment or DaemonSet if the value is "enabled". Set the value to "disabled" to reset to AKS defaults. | "enabled" or "disabled" |
`kubernetes.azure.com/override-min-max` |
Supports the capability to customize the container policy maximum/minimum allowed CPU/memory value in VPA custom resource if the value is "enabled". Set the value to "disabled" to reset to AKS defaults. | "enabled" or "disabled" |

Supports the capability to customize the update policy `updateMode` value in a VPA custom resource if the value is "enabled". Set the value to "disabled" to reset to AKS defaults. |
"enabled" or "disabled" |

## Customize resource CPU/memory requests/limits

After setting the `kubernetes.azure.com/override-requests-limits`

annotation to "enabled" in a Deployment or DaemonSet, you can customize the resource CPU/memory requests and limits. The following example shows how to customize the resource CPU/memory requests and limits in a Deployment:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: coredns
namespace: kube-system
annotations:
# update value from "disabled" to "enabled"
kubernetes.azure.com/override-requests-limits: "enabled"
spec:
...
containers:
- name: coredns
resources:
limits:
# update cpu limits value won't be reconciled back
cpu: "3"
# update memory limits value won't be reconciled back
memory: "500Mi"
requests:
# update cpu requests value won't be reconciled back
cpu: "100m"
# update memory requests value won't be reconciled back
memory: "70Mi"
```


## Customize resource maximum/minimum allowed CPU/memory

After setting the `kubernetes.azure.com/override-min-max`

annotation to "enabled" in a VPA custom resource, you can customize the maximum and minimum allowed CPU and memory values in a VPA custom resource. The following example shows how to customize the maximum and minimum allowed CPU and memory values in a VPA custom resource:

```
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
name: coredns
namespace: kube-system
annotations:
# update value from "disabled" to "enabled"
kubernetes.azure.com/override-min-max: "enabled"
spec:
resourcePolicy:
containerPolicies:
- containerName: coredns
maxAllowed:
# update maxAllowed cpu value won't be reconciled back
cpu: 3
# update maxAllowed memory value won't be reconciled back
memory: 500Mi
minAllowed:
# update minAllowed cpu value won't be reconciled back
cpu: 10m
# update minAllowed memory value won't be reconciled back
memory: 10Mi
...
```


## Customize resource update mode

After setting the `kubernetes.azure.com/override-update-mode`

annotation to "enabled" in a VPA custom resource, you can customize the update policy `updateMode`

value in a VPA custom resource to "Off" or "Initial" (default). The following example shows how to customize the update policy `updateMode`

value to "Initial" in a VPA custom resource:

```
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
name: coredns
namespace: kube-system
annotations:
# update value from "disabled" to "enabled"
kubernetes.azure.com/override-update-mode: "enabled"
spec:
...
updatePolicy:
# update updateMode won't be reconciled back
updateMode: "Initial"
```


## Disable VPA on a specific AKS managed add-on

To disable VPA on a specific AKS managed add-on, you need to update the VPA custom resource YAML file to set the `kubernetes.azure.com/override-update-mode`

annotation to `"enabled"`

and the `updateMode`

to `"Off"`

. With *Off* mode, the VPA only provides CPU and memory recommendations and doesn't apply the changes to the pod.

The following example shows how to disable VPA on the CoreDNS add-on:

```
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
name: coredns
namespace: kube-system
annotations:
# Set value to "enabled"
kubernetes.azure.com/override-update-mode: "enabled"
spec:
...
updatePolicy:
# Set value to "Off"
updateMode: "Off"
```


## Troubleshooting

- Make sure the AKS managed add-on supports the cost optimized add-on scaling feature. For more information, see
[Supported AKS managed add-ons](optimized-addon-scaling#supported-aks-add-ons). - Verify that the
`kubernetes.azure.com/override-requests-limits`

annotation in the Deployment or DaemonSet is set to "enabled". - Verify that the
`kubernetes.azure.com/override-min-max`

annotation in the VPA custom resource is set to "enabled". - Verify that the
`kubernetes.azure.com/override-update-mode`

annotation in the VPA custom resource is set to "enabled".

## Next steps

To further configure cluster resource utilization and free up CPU/memory for AKS managed add-on pods, see [Vertical pod autoscaling in AKS](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

# Tutorial - Deploy an application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. You build and deploy your own applications and services into a Kubernetes cluster and let the cluster manage the availability and connectivity.

In this tutorial, you deploy a sample application into a Kubernetes cluster. You learn how to:

- Update a Kubernetes manifest file.
- Run an application in Kubernetes.
- Test the application.

Tip

With AKS, you can use the following approaches for configuration management:

**GitOps**: Enables declarations of your cluster's state to automatically apply to the cluster. To learn how to use GitOps to deploy an application with an AKS cluster, see the[prerequisites for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/tutorial-use-gitops-flux2?toc=/azure/aks/toc.json#for-azure-kubernetes-service-clusters)in the[GitOps with Flux v2](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/tutorial-use-gitops-flux2?toc=/azure/aks/toc.json)tutorial.**DevOps**: Enables you to build, test, and deploy with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). To see examples of how to use DevOps to deploy an application with an AKS cluster, see[Build and deploy to AKS with Azure Pipelines](devops-pipeline)or[GitHub Actions for deploying to Kubernetes](kubernetes-action).

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you packaged an application into a container image, uploaded the image to Azure Container Registry, and created a Kubernetes cluster. To complete this tutorial, you need the precreated `aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

Kubernetes manifest file. This file was downloaded in the application source code from [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. Check your version with `az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update the manifest file

In these tutorials, your Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance stores the container images for the sample application. To deploy the application, you must update the image names in the Kubernetes manifest file to include your ACR login server name.

Get your login server address using the

command and query for your login server.`az acr list`

`az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table`

Make sure you're in the cloned

*aks-store-demo*directory, and then open the`aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

manifest file with a text editor.Update the

`image`

property for the containers by replacing*ghcr.io/azure-samples*with your ACR login server name.`containers: ... - name: order-service image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/order-service:latest ... - name: product-service image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/product-service:latest ... - name: store-front image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/store-front:latest ...`

Save and close the file.


## Run the application

Deploy the application using the

command, which parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

The following example output shows the resources successfully created in the AKS cluster:

`statefulset.apps/rabbitmq created configmap/rabbitmq-enabled-plugins created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created`

Check the deployment is successful by viewing the pods with the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods`


## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

### Command Line

Monitor progress using the

command with the`kubectl get service`

`--watch`

argument.`kubectl get service store-front --watch`

Initially, the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

for the`store-front`

service shows as`<pending>`

:`store-front LoadBalancer 10.0.34.242 <pending> 80:30676/TCP 5s`

When the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

address changes from`<pending>`

to a public IP address, use`CTRL-C`

to stop the`kubectl`

watch process.The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

`store-front LoadBalancer 10.0.34.242 52.179.23.131 80:30676/TCP 67s`

View the application in action by opening a web browser and navigating to the external IP address of your service:

`http://<external-ip>`

.

If the application doesn't load, it might be an authorization problem with your image registry. To view the status of your containers, use the `kubectl get pods`

command. If you can't pull the container images, see [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration).

### Azure portal

Navigate to the Azure portal to find your deployment information.

Navigate to your AKS cluster resource.

From the service menu, under

**Kubernetes Resources**, select**Services and ingresses**.Copy the External IP shown in the column for the

`store-front`

service.Paste the IP into your browser to visit your store page.


## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can now remove the cluster from the application. We will deploy the application again in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

Check that all the application pods have been removed using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you deployed a sample Azure application to a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learned how to:

- Update a Kubernetes manifest file.
- Run an application in Kubernetes.
- Test the application.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to use PaaS services for stateful workloads in Kubernetes.

# Overview of managed namespaces in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

**Applies to:** ✔️ AKS Automatic ✔️ AKS Standard

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. With logical isolation, you can use a single AKS cluster for multiple workloads, teams, or environments. Kubernetes namespaces form the logical isolation boundary for workloads and resources. Performing logical isolation involves implementing scripts and processes to create namespaces, set resource limits, apply network policies, and grant team access via role-based access control. Learn how to use managed namespaces in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to simplify namespace management, cluster multi-tenancy, and resource isolation.

Logical separation of clusters usually provides a higher pod density than physically isolated clusters, with less excess compute capacity sitting idle in the cluster. When combined with [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler) or [Node Auto Provisioning](node-autoprovision), you can scale the number of nodes up or down to meet demands. This best practice approach minimizes costs by running only the required number of nodes.

## Network policies

[Network Policies](use-network-policies) are Kubernetes resources you can use to control the flow of traffic between pods, namespaces, and external endpoints. Network policies allow you to define rules for ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic, ensuring that only authorized communication is permitted. By applying network policies, you can enhance the security and isolation of workloads within your cluster.

Note

The default ingress network policy rule of **Allow same namespace** opts for a secure by default stance. If you need your Kubernetes Services, ingresses, or gateways to be accessible from outside of the namespace where they're deployed, for example from an ingress controller deployed in a separate namespace, you need to select **Allow all**. You might then apply your own network policy to restrict ingress to be from that namespace only.

Managed namespaces come with a set of built-in policies.

**Allow all**: Allows all network traffic.**Allow same namespace**: Allows all network traffic within the same namespace.**Deny all**: Denies all network traffic.

You can apply any of the built-in policies on both **ingress** and **egress** rules and they have the following default values.

| Policy | Default value |
|---|---|
| Ingress | Allow same namespace |
| Egress | Allow all |

Note

Users with a `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/networking.k8s.io/networkpolicies/write`

action, such as `Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer`

, on the Microsoft Entra ID role they're assigned can add more network policies through the Kubernetes API.

For example, if an admin applies a `Deny All`

policy for ingress/egress, and a user applies an `Allow`

policy for a namespace via the Kubernetes API, the `Allow`

policy takes priority over the `Deny All`

policy, and traffic is allowed to flow for the namespace.

## Resource quotas

[Resource Quotas](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas) are Kubernetes resources that are used to manage and limit the resource consumption of namespaces within a cluster. They allow administrators to define constraints on the amount of CPU, memory, storage, or other resources that are used by workloads in a namespace. By applying resource quotas, you can ensure fair resource distribution, prevent resource overuse, and maintain cluster stability.

Managed namespaces can be created with the following resource quotas:

**CPU requests and limits**: Define the minimum and maximum amount of CPU resources that workloads in the namespace can request or consume. The quota ensures that workloads have sufficient CPU resources to operate while preventing overuse that could affect other namespaces. The quota is defined in the[milliCPU form](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu).**Memory requests and limits**: Specify the minimum and maximum amount of memory resources that workloads in the namespace can request or consume. The quota helps maintain stability by avoiding memory overcommitment and ensuring fair resource allocation across namespaces. The quota is defined in[power-of-two equivalents form](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)such as`Ei`

,`Pi`

,`Ti`

,`Gi`

,`Mi`

,`Ki`

.

## Labels and annotations

Kubernetes [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) and [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) are metadata attached to Kubernetes objects, such as namespaces, to provide additional information. Labels are key-value pairs used to organize and select resources, enabling efficient grouping and querying. Annotations store nonidentifying metadata, such as configuration details or operational instructions, that are consumed by tools or systems.

You can optionally set Kubernetes Labels and Annotations to be applied on the namespace.

## Adoption policy

The adoption policy determines how an existing namespace in Kubernetes is handled when creating a managed namespace.

Warning

Onboarding an existing namespace to be managed can cause disruption. If the **resource quota** applied is less than what is already being requested by pods, new deployments and pods that exceed the quota is denied. Existing deployments aren't affected, but scaling is denied. Applying **network policies** to an existing namespace can affect existing traffic. Ensure that the policies are tested and validated to avoid unintended disruptions to communication between pods or external endpoints.

The following options are available:

**Never**: If the namespace already exists in the cluster, attempts to create that namespace as a managed namespace fails.**IfIdentical**: Take over the existing namespace to be managed, provided there are no differences between the existing namespace and the desired configuration.**Always**: Always take over the existing namespace to be managed, even if some fields in the namespace might be overwritten.

## Delete policy

The delete policy specifies how the Kubernetes namespace is handled when the managed namespace resource is deleted.

Warning

Deleting a managed namespace with the **Delete** policy causes all resources within that namespace, such as Deployments, Services, Ingresses, and other Kubernetes objects, to be deleted. Ensure that you back up or migrate any critical resources before proceeding.

The following options are available:

**Keep**: Only delete the managed namespace resource while keeping the Kubernetes namespace intact. Additionally, the`ManagedByARM`

label is removed from the namespace.**Delete**: Delete both the managed namespace resource and the Kubernetes namespace together.

## Managed namespaces built-in roles

Managed namespaces uses the following built-in roles for the control plane.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Kubernetes Service Namespace User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-namespace-user)Managed namespaces uses the following built-in roles for the data plane.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-writer)[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)## Managed namespaces use cases

Properly setting up [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) with associated [quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/quota-memory-cpu-namespace/) or [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#networkpolicy-resource) can be complex and time-consuming. Managed namespaces allow you to set up preconfigured namespaces in your AKS clusters that you can interact with using the Azure CLI.

The following sections outline some common use cases for managed namespaces.

### Manage teams and resources on AKS

Let's say you're an admin at a small startup. You have an AKS cluster provisioned and want to set up namespaces for developers from your *finance*, *legal*, and *design* teams. As you're setting up your company's environment, you want to make sure that access is tightly controlled, resources are rightly scoped, and environments are organized properly.

The

*finance*team intakes forms and files from teams all across the company, but they hold sensitive information that ideally shouldn't leave their environment. Their applications and workflows are lighter on the computing side but consume a lot of memory. As a result, you decide to set up a namespace that allows for all network ingress, network egress only within their namespace, and scope their resources accordingly. A label to the namespace helps easily identify which team is using it.`az aks namespace add \ --name $FINANCE_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 250m \ --cpu-limit 500m \ --memory-request 512Mi \ --memory-limit 2Gi \ --ingress-policy AllowAll \ --egress-policy AllowSameNamespace \ --labels team=finance`

The

*legal*team deals primarily with sensitive data. Their applications use a fair amount of memory but require little compute resources. You decide to set up a namespace that's extremely restrictive for both the ingress/egress policies, and scope their resource quotas accordingly.`az aks namespace add \ --name $LEGAL_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 250m \ --cpu-limit 500m \ --memory-request 2Gi \ --memory-limit 5Gi \ --ingress-policy DenyAll \ --egress-policy DenyAll \ --labels team=legal`

The

*design*team needs the ability to freely flow data to showcase their work across the company. They also encourage teams to send them content for reference. Their applications are intensive and require a large chunk of memory and CPU. You decide to set them up with a minimally restrictive namespace and allocate a sizeable amount of resources for them.`az aks namespace add \ --name $DESIGN_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 2000m \ --cpu-limit 2500m \ --memory-request 5Gi \ --memory-limit 8Gi \ --ingress-policy AllowAll \ --egress-policy AllowAll \ --labels team=design`


With these namespaces set up, you now have environments for the three teams in your organization that should allow each team to get up and running in an environment that best suits their needs. Admins can use [Azure CLI calls](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/namespace) to update the namespaces as needs shift.

### View managed namespaces

As the number of teams you deal with expands, or as your organization grows, you might find yourself needing to review the namespaces you set up.

Let's say you want to review the namespaces in your cluster from the [previous section](#manage-teams-and-resources-on-aks) to ensure there are three namespaces.

Use the [ az aks namespace list](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/namespace#az-aks-namespace-list) command to review your namespaces.

```
az aks namespace list \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--output table
```


Your output should look similar to the following example output:

```
Name ResourceGroup Location
------------------ --------------- ----------
$CLUSTER_NAME/$DESIGN_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
$CLUSTER_NAME/$LEGAL_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
$CLUSTER_NAME/$FINANCE_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
```


### Control access to managed namespaces

You can further use [Azure RBAC roles](#managed-namespaces-built-in-roles), scoped to each namespace, to determine which users have access to certain actions within the namespace. With the proper configuration, you can ensure users have all the access they need within the namespace, while limiting their access to other namespaces or cluster-wide resources.

# Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Workloads deployed on an AKS cluster require Microsoft Entra application credentials or managed identities to access Microsoft Entra protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault and Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Entra Workload ID integrates with the capabilities native to Kubernetes to federate with external identity providers, allowing you to assign workload identities to your workloads to authenticate and access other services and resources.

[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identities-overview) uses [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#serviceaccount-token-volume-projection) (or a *service account*), to enable pods to use a Kubernetes identity. A Kubernetes token is issued and [OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure resources securely with Microsoft Entra ID, based on annotated service accounts.

You can use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with [Azure Identity client libraries](#azure-identity-client-libraries) or the [Microsoft Authentication Library](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) (MSAL) collection, together with [application registration](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/application-model#register-an-application), to seamlessly authenticate and access Azure cloud resources.

Note

You can use *Service Connector* to help you configure some steps automatically. For more information, see [What is Service Connector?](/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview)

## Prerequisites

- AKS supports Microsoft Entra Workload ID on version 1.22 and higher.
- The Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version, and run`az upgrade`

to upgrade the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

- You can have a maximum of
[20 federated identity credentials](/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-considerations#general-federated-identity-credential-considerations)per managed identity. - It takes a few seconds for the federated identity credential to propagate after being initially added.
- The
[virtual nodes](virtual-nodes)add-on, based on the open source project[Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/docs/), isn't supported. - Creation of federated identity credentials isn't supported on user-assigned managed identities in
[these regions](/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-considerations#unsupported-regions-user-assigned-managed-identities).

## Azure Identity client libraries

In the Azure Identity client libraries, choose one of the following approaches:

- Use
`DefaultAzureCredential`

, which attempts to use the`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

. - Create a
`ChainedTokenCredential`

instance that includes`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

. - Use
`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

directly.

The following table provides the **minimum** package version required for each language ecosystem's client library:

| Ecosystem | Library | Minimum version |
|---|---|---|
| .NET |
|

[azure-identity-cpp](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)[azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity)[azure-identity](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)[@azure/identity](/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)[azure-identity](/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)## Azure Identity client library code samples

The following code samples use the `DefaultAzureCredential`

. This credential type uses the environment variables injected by the workload identity mutating [webhook](#webhook-certificate-auto-rotation) to authenticate with Azure Key Vault. To see samples using one of the other approaches, refer to the [ecosystem-specific client libraries](#azure-identity-client-libraries).

```
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;
string keyVaultUrl = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("<key-vault-url>");
string secretName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("<secret-name>");
var client = new SecretClient(
new Uri(keyVaultUrl),
new DefaultAzureCredential());
KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync(secretName);
```


## Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)

The following client libraries are the **minimum** version required:

| Ecosystem | Library | Image | Example | Has Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| .NET |
|

`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-net:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-net/akvdotnet)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-go](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-go)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-java:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-java)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-node:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-python)## How it works

In this security model, the AKS cluster acts as the token issuer. Microsoft Entra ID uses OIDC to discover public signing keys and verify the authenticity of the service account token before exchanging it for a Microsoft Entra token. Your workload can exchange a service account token projected to its volume for a Microsoft Entra token using the Azure Identity client library or the MSAL.

The following table describes the required OIDC issuer endpoints for Microsoft Entra Workload ID:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
`{IssuerURL}/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
Also known as the OIDC discovery document. This contains the metadata about the issuer's configurations. |
`{IssuerURL}/openid/v1/jwks` |
This contains the public signing key(s) that Microsoft Entra ID uses to verify the authenticity of the service account token. |

The following diagram summarizes the authentication sequence using OIDC:

### Webhook certificate auto-rotation

Similar to other webhook add-ons, the [cluster certificate auto-rotation](certificate-rotation#certificate-autorotation) operation rotates the certificate.

## Service account labels and annotations

Microsoft Entra Workload ID supports the following mappings related to a service account:

**One-to-one**, where a service account references a Microsoft Entra object.**Many-to-one**, where multiple service accounts reference the same Microsoft Entra object.**One-to-many**, where a service account references multiple Microsoft Entra objects by changing the client ID annotation. For more information, see[How to federate multiple identities with a Kubernetes service account](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/faq.html#how-to-federate-multiple-identities-with-a-kubernetes-service-account).

Note

If you update the service account annotations, you must restart the pod for the changes to take effect.

If you've used [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity), think of a service account as an Azure security principal, except that a service account is part of the core Kubernetes API, rather than a [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) (CRD). The following sections describe a list of available labels and annotations that you can use to configure the behavior when exchanging the service account token for a Microsoft Entra access token.

### Service account annotations

All annotations are optional. If the annotation isn't specified, the default value is used.

| Annotation | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/client-id` |
Represents the Microsoft Entra application client ID to be used with the pod. |
|
`azure.workload.identity/tenant-id` |
Represents the Azure tenant ID where the Microsoft Entra application is registered. |
AZURE_TENANT_ID environment variable extracted from `azure-wi-webhook-config` ConfigMap. |
`azure.workload.identity/service-account-token-expiration` |
Represents the `expirationSeconds` field for the projected service account token. It's an optional field that you configure to prevent any downtime caused by errors during service account token refresh. Kubernetes service account token expiry isn't correlated with Microsoft Entra tokens. Microsoft Entra tokens expire in 24 hours after they're issued. |
3600 Supported range is 3600-86400. |

### Pod labels

Note

For applications using Microsoft Entra Workload ID, it's required to add the label `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`

to the pod spec for AKS to move the workload identity to a *Fail Close* scenario to provide a consistent and reliable behavior for pods that need to use workload identity. Otherwise, the pods fail after they're restarted.

| Label | Description | Recommended value | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/use` |
This label is required in the pod template spec. Only pods with this label are mutated by the azure-workload-identity mutating admission webhook to inject the Azure specific environment variables and the projected service account token volume. | true | Yes |

### Pod annotations

All annotations are optional. If the annotation isn't specified, the default value is used.

| Annotation | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/service-account-token-expiration` |
See
Pod annotations take precedence over service account annotations. |

Supported range is 3600-86400.

`azure.workload.identity/skip-containers`

`container1;container2`

.`azure.workload.identity/use: true`

.`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar`

`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port`

## Migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID

You can configure clusters already running a pod-managed identity to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID using one of two ways:

- Use the same configuration you implemented for pod-managed identity. You can annotate the service account within the namespace with the identity to enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID and inject the annotations into the pods.
- Rewrite your application to use the latest version of the Azure Identity client library.

To help streamline and ease the migration process, we developed a migration sidecar that converts the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions your application makes over to [OIDC](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc). The migration sidecar isn't intended to be a long-term solution, but a way to get up and running quickly on Microsoft Entra Workload ID. Running the migration sidecar within your application proxies the application IMDS transactions over to OIDC. The alternative approach is to upgrade to a supported version of the [Azure Identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries) client library, which supports OIDC authentication.

The following table summarizes our migration or deployment recommendations for your AKS cluster:

| Scenario | Description |

# Migrate to Key Management Service (KMS) v2 in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

This article applies to clusters using the legacy KMS experience that need to migrate from KMS v1 to KMS v2. For clusters running Kubernetes version 1.33 or later, we recommend using the new [KMS data encryption](kms-data-encryption) experience, which offers platform-managed keys, customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation, and a simplified configuration experience.

In this article, you learn how to migrate to KMS v2 for clusters with versions older than 1.27. Beginning in AKS version 1.27, turning on the KMS feature configures KMS v2. With KMS v2, you aren't limited to the 2,000 secrets that earlier versions support. For more information, see [KMS v2 improvements](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/16/kms-v2-moves-to-beta/).

Important

If your cluster version is older than 1.27 and you already turned on KMS, the upgrade to cluster version 1.27 or later is blocked.

## Turn off KMS

Disable KMS on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

parameter.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`


## Upgrade your AKS cluster and turn on KMS

Upgrade your AKS cluster to version 1.27 or later using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--kubernetes-version`

parameter set to your desired version. The following example upgrades to version`1.27.1`

:`az aks upgrade --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --kubernetes-version 1.27.1`

Once the upgrade completes, you can turn on KMS for a public or private key vault using one of the following resources:

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`

# Best practices for basic scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. The Kubernetes scheduler lets you control the distribution of compute resources, or limit the impact of maintenance events.

This best practices article focuses on basic Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Use resource quotas to provide a fixed amount of resources to teams or workloads
- Limit the impact of scheduled maintenance using pod disruption budgets

## Enforce resource quotas


Best practice guidancePlan and apply resource quotas at the namespace level. If pods don't define resource requests and limits, reject the deployment. Monitor resource usage and adjust quotas as needed.


Resource requests and limits are placed in the pod specification. Requests are used by the Kubernetes scheduler at deployment time to find an available node in the cluster. Limits and requests work at the individual pod level. For more information about how to define these values, see [Define pod resource requests and limits](developer-best-practices-resource-management#define-pod-resource-requests-and-limits).

To provide a way to reserve and limit resources across a development team or project, you should use *resource quotas*. These quotas are defined on a namespace, and can be used to set quotas on the following basis:

**Compute resources**, such as CPU and memory, or GPUs.**Storage resources**, including the total number of volumes or amount of disk space for a given storage class.**Object count**, such as maximum number of secrets, services, or jobs can be created.

Kubernetes doesn't overcommit resources. Once your cumulative resource request total passes the assigned quota, all further deployments will be unsuccessful.

When you define resource quotas, all pods created in the namespace must provide limits or requests in their pod specifications. If they don't provide these values, you can reject the deployment. Instead, you can [configure default requests and limits for a namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/).

The following example YAML manifest named *dev-app-team-quotas.yaml* sets a hard limit of a total of *10* CPUs, *20Gi* of memory, and *10* pods:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
name: dev-app-team
spec:
hard:
cpu: "10"
memory: 20Gi
pods: "10"
```


This resource quota can be applied by specifying the namespace, such as *dev-apps*:

```
kubectl apply -f dev-app-team-quotas.yaml --namespace dev-apps
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate resource quotas.

For more information about available resource objects, scopes, and priorities, see [Resource quotas in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/).

## Plan for availability using pod disruption budgets


Best practice guidanceTo maintain the availability of applications, define Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) to make sure that a minimum number of pods are available in the cluster.


There are two disruptive events that cause pods to be removed:

### Involuntary disruptions

*Involuntary disruptions* are events beyond the typical control of the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Hardware failure on the physical machine
- Kernel panic
- Deletion of a node VM

Involuntary disruptions can be mitigated by:

- Using multiple replicas of your pods in a deployment.
- Running multiple nodes in the AKS cluster.

### Voluntary disruptions

*Voluntary disruptions* are events requested by the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Cluster upgrades
- Updated deployment template
- Accidentally deleting a pod

Kubernetes provides *pod disruption budgets* for voluntary disruptions, letting you plan for how deployments or replica sets respond when a voluntary disruption event occurs. Using pod disruption budgets, cluster operators can define a minimum available or maximum unavailable resource count.

If you upgrade a cluster or update a deployment template, the Kubernetes scheduler will schedule extra pods on other nodes before allowing voluntary disruption events to continue. The scheduler waits to reboot a node until the defined number of pods are successfully scheduled on other nodes in the cluster.

Let's look at an example of a replica set with five pods that run NGINX. The pods in the replica set are assigned the label `app: nginx-frontend`

. During a voluntary disruption event, such as a cluster upgrade, you want to make sure at least three pods continue to run. The following YAML manifest for a *PodDisruptionBudget* object defines these requirements:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
minAvailable: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


You can also define a percentage, such as *60%*, which allows you to automatically compensate for the replica set scaling up the number of pods.

You can define a maximum number of unavailable instances in a replica set. Again, a percentage for the maximum unavailable pods can also be defined. The following pod disruption budget YAML manifest defines that no more than two pods in the replica set be unavailable:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
maxUnavailable: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


Once your pod disruption budget is defined, you create it in your AKS cluster as with any other Kubernetes object:

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-pdb.yaml
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate pod disruption budgets.

For more information about using pod disruption budgets, see [Specify a disruption budget for your application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/).

Set the following environment variables for your resource group, cluster name, and location:

```
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group-name>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<your-cluster-name>"
export LOCATION="<your-azure-region>"
```


## Limitations

- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not yet available for Windows node pool.
- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not supported for AKS automatic because of
[node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown)preventing role assignments.

## Configure SSH access

To improve security and support your corporate security requirements or strategy, AKS supports disabling SSH both on the cluster and at the node pool level. Disable SSH introduces a simplified approach compared to configuring [network security group rules](concepts-security#azure-network-security-groups) on the AKS subnet/node network interface card (NIC). Disable SSH only supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools.

When you disable SSH at cluster creation time, it takes effect after the cluster is created. However, when you disable SSH on an existing cluster or node pool, AKS doesn't automatically disable SSH. At any time, you can choose to perform a nodepool upgrade operation. The disable/enable SSH operation takes effect after the node image update is complete.

Note

When you disable SSH at the cluster level, it applies to all existing node pools. Any node pools created after this operation will have SSH enabled by default, and you'll need to run these commands again in order to disable it.

Note

[kubectl debug node](node-access) continues to work after you disable SSH because it doesn't depend on the SSH service.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Disable SSH on a new cluster deployment

By default, the SSH service on AKS cluster nodes is open to all users and pods running on the cluster. You can prevent direct SSH access from any network to cluster nodes to help limit the attack vector if a container in a pod becomes compromised.

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a new cluster, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on all the node pools during cluster creation.Important

After you disable the SSH service, you can't SSH into the cluster to perform administrative tasks or to troubleshoot.

Note

On a newly created cluster, disable SSH will only configure the first system node pool. All other node pools need to be configured at the node pool level.

```
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command to add a node pool, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To disable SSH on an existing cluster, you need to disable SSH for each node pool on this cluster.

### Re-enable SSH access

To re-enable SSH access on a node pool, update the node pool with either `--ssh-access localuser`

(for traditional SSH key-based access) or `--ssh-access entraid`

(for Entra ID based access). See the respective sections for detailed instructions.

You can configure your AKS cluster to use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for SSH authentication to cluster nodes. This eliminates the need to manage SSH keys and allows you to use your Entra ID credentials to access nodes securely.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH on a new cluster

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH authentication during cluster creation.```
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for an existing node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing cluster, you need to enable it for each node pool individually.

Local user SSH access uses traditional SSH key-based authentication. This is the default SSH access method for AKS clusters.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Create an AKS cluster with SSH keys

Use the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to deploy an AKS cluster with an SSH public key. You can either specify the key or a key file using the `--ssh-key-value`

argument, or use `--ssh-access localuser`

to explicitly set local user SSH access.

| SSH parameter | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`--generate-ssh-key` |
If you don't have your own SSH keys, specify `--generate-ssh-key` . The Azure CLI automatically generates a set of SSH keys and saves them in the default directory `~/.ssh/` . |
|
`--ssh-key-value` |
Public key path or key contents to install on node VMs for SSH access. For example, `ssh-rsa AAAAB...snip...UcyupgH azureuser@linuxvm` . |
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
`--ssh-access localuser` |
Explicitly enable local user SSH access with key-based authentication. | |
`--no-ssh-key` |
If you don't require SSH keys, specify this argument. However, AKS automatically generates a set of SSH keys because the Azure Virtual Machine resource dependency doesn't support an empty SSH keys file. As a result, the keys aren't returned and can't be used to SSH into the node VMs. The private key is discarded and not saved. |

Note

If no parameters are specified, the Azure CLI defaults to referencing the SSH keys stored in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

file. If the keys aren't found, the command returns the message `An RSA key file or key value must be supplied to SSH Key Value`

.

**Examples:**

To create a cluster and use the default generated SSH keys:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --generate-ssh-key`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

To explicitly enable local user SSH access:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-access localuser --generate-ssh-key`


### Enable local user SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


### Enable local user SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


Important

For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


### Update SSH public key on an existing AKS cluster

Use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command to update the SSH public key (preview) on your cluster. This operation updates the key on all node pools. You can either specify a key or a key file using the

`--ssh-key-value`

argument.Note

Updating the SSH keys is supported on Azure virtual machine scale sets with AKS clusters.

**Examples:**

To specify a new SSH public key value:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza-xxx'`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`


Important

After you update the SSH key, AKS doesn't automatically update your node pool. At any time, you can choose to perform a [nodepool upgrade operation](node-image-upgrade). The update SSH keys operation takes effect after a node image update is complete. For clusters with [Node Auto-provisioning](node-autoprovision) enabled, a node image update can be performed by applying a new label to the Kubernetes NodePool custom resource.

## Verify SSH service status

After disabling SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is inactive on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is disabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:36:53 UTC; 25min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: inactive (dead)`

, which confirms SSH is disabled on the node.

After enabling Entra ID based SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active and configured for Entra ID authentication on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

After configuring local user SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

# Configure LocalDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

LocalDNS is a feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) designed to enhance the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution performance and resiliency for workloads running in your cluster. When you deploy a DNS proxy on each node, LocalDNS reduces DNS query latency, improves reliability during network disruptions, and provides advanced configuration options for DNS caching and forwarding. This article explains how LocalDNS works, its configuration options, and how to enable, verify, and troubleshoot LocalDNS in your AKS clusters.

To learn about what LocalDNS is, including architecture details, and key capabilities, refer to [DNS Resolution in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](dns-concepts).

## Best practices for LocalDNS configuration

When implementing LocalDNS in your AKS clusters, consider the following best practices:

**Start with a minimal configuration**: Begin with a simple configuration that uses the`Preferred`

mode to validate your LocalDNS configuration syntax before moving to`Required`

mode. The`Preferred`

mode validates your configuration without enabling LocalDNS, allowing you to catch configuration errors early without impacting your cluster.**Implement proper caching strategies**: Configure cache settings based on your workload characteristics:- For frequently changing records, use shorter
`cacheDurationInSeconds`

values. When doing so, it's important to note that cacheDurationInSeconds acts as a cap on the DNS record TTL but doesn't increase it. The resulting TTL is the smaller of what is returned from upstream or what is set in the cache plugin. - For stable records, use longer cache durations to reduce DNS queries.
- Enable
`serveStale`

with appropriate settings to maintain service during DNS outages. - Caching with LocalDNS operates on a best effort basis and doesn't guarantee stale responses. The cache is divided into 256 shards and with a default maximum of 10,000 entries, allowing each shard to hold about 39 entries. When a shard is full and a new entry needs to be added, one of the existing entries is chosen at random to be evicted. There's no preference for older or expires entries. As a result, a stale record might not always be available, especially under high query volume.

- For frequently changing records, use shorter
**Monitor DNS performance**: After enabling LocalDNS, monitor your application's DNS performance using:- Application performance metrics.
- Node metrics to detect reduced network pressure.
- Log entries when
`queryLogging`

is set to`Log`

.

**Follow least privilege principle**: When configuring DNS forwarding rules, only allow access to the required DNS servers and domains.**Test before production deployment**: Always test LocalDNS configuration in a nonproduction environment before rolling it out to production clusters.**Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Store your*localdnsconfig.json*file in your infrastructure repository and include it in your AKS deployment templates.**Network configuration for TCP forwarding**: When using TCP for DNS forwarding to VnetDNS, ensure that your Network Security Groups (NSGs), firewalls, or Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) don't block TCP traffic between CoreDNS/LocalDNS and VnetDNS servers.**Avoid enabling both NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS**: It isn't recommended to enable both the upstream Kubernetes NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS in your node pool. While AKS doesn't block this configuration, all DNS traffic is routed through LocalDNS, which might lead to unexpected behavior or reduced benefits from NodeLocal DNSCache.

## Prerequisites

You must have an existing AKS cluster with Kubernetes versions 1.31 and later to use LocalDNS. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using

[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).This article requires Azure CLI version 2.80.0 and later. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

LocalDNS is only supported on node pools running Azure Linux or Ubuntu 22.04 and newer.

The Virtual Machine (VM) SKU used for your node pool must have at least 4 vCPUs (cores) to support LocalDNS.

LocalDNS isn't compatible with applied Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) filter policies in

[Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies).

## Manage LocalDNS on an AKS cluster

LocalDNS is configured at the node pool level in AKS, meaning you can enable or disable LocalDNS independently for each node pool in your cluster. This tailors DNS resolution behavior based on the specific requirements of different workloads or environments. To enable LocalDNS on a node pool, you need to provide a configuration file: *localdnsconfig.json* that defines how LocalDNS should operate for that node pool.

If you don't specify a custom configuration file, AKS automatically applies a default LocalDNS configuration.

Note

If you're using Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP), see [LocalDNS configuration](node-auto-provisioning-aksnodeclass#localdns-configuration) for instructions on how to enable LocalDNS with NAP.

To enable LocalDNS during node pool creation, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool add --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


To enable LocalDNS on an existing node pool, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool update --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


Important

Enabling LocalDNS on a node pool initiates a reimage operation on all nodes within that pool. This process can cause temporary disruption to running workloads and might lead to application downtime if not properly managed. You should plan for potential service interruptions and ensure that the applications are configured for high availability or have appropriate disruption budgets in place before enabling this setting.

# Tutorial - Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this tutorial, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker`

commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) system.

Note

Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Use

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)to clone the sample application to your development environment.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git`

Change into the cloned directory.

`cd aks-store-demo`


## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [ docker-compose-quickstart YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the

[repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main)you cloned.

```


## Create container images and run application

You can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the

`docker compose`

command:`docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d`

View the created images using the

command.`docker images`

`docker images`

The following condensed example output shows the created images:

`REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID aks-store-demo-product-service latest 72f5cd7e6b84 aks-store-demo-order-service latest 54ad5de546f9 aks-store-demo-store-front latest 1125f85632ae ...`

View the running containers using the

command.`docker ps`

`docker ps`

The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

`CONTAINER ID IMAGE f27fe74cfd0a aks-store-demo-product-service df1eaa137885 aks-store-demo-order-service b3ce9e496e96 aks-store-demo-store-front 31df28627ffa rabbitmq:3.13.2-management-alpine`


## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. * Do not delete the container images* - you use them in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

command.`docker-compose down`

`docker compose down`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample application, created container images for the application, and then tested the application. You learned how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.

# Use Arm-based processor (Arm64) Virtual Machines (VMs) in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster for cost effectiveness

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Arm-based processors (Arm64)](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/cobalt-overview) are power-efficient and cost-effective, but don't compromise on performance. These Arm64 VMs are engineered to efficiently run dynamic, scalable workloads and can deliver up to 50% better price-performance than comparable x86-based VMs for scale-out workloads.

Because of their ability to scale workloads efficiently, Arm64 VMs are well-suited for web or application servers, open-source databases, cloud-native applications, gaming servers, and other high traffic applications.

Note

While a combination of CPU, memory, and networking capacity configurations heavily influences the cost effectiveness of a SKU, Arm64 VM types are recommended for cost optimization.

In this article, you'll learn how to add a Arm64 VM to an existing node pool.

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Limitations

- Arm64 VMs aren't supported for Windows node pools.
- Existing node pools can't be updated to use an Arm64 VM.
- Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS)-enabled node pools are only supported with Arm64 SKUs when using Azure Linux 3.0+.
- Arm64 node pools aren't supported on Defender-enabled clusters with Kubernetes version 1.29.0 or lower.

## Create node pools with Arm64 VMs

The Arm64 processor provides low power compute for your Kubernetes workloads. Arm64 virtual machines can be added to existing clusters even mixing Intel and Arm architecture node pools within a cluster. To create an Arm64 node pool, you need to choose a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series), [Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or [Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series) series virtual machine.

### Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

Use [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) to add a node pool with an Arm64 VM to an existing cluster. Alternatively, if you're using

[Azure Linux 3.0+](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/how-to-enable-azure-linux-3), you can add a node pool with an Arm64 VM and

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled.

Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

Add a FIPS-enabled node pool with an Arm64 VM

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use the

with`az aks nodepool add`

`--enable-fips-image`

and`--os-sku`

parameters.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --os-sku AzureLinux --enable-fips-image --kubernetes-version 1.31 --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see

[Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
Update a node pool with an Arm64 VM to enable FIPS

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter to enable FIPS on an existing node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see [Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).

## Verify the node pool uses Arm64

Verify a node pool uses Arm64 using the [ az aks nodepool show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command and verify the

`vmSize`

is a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series),

[Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or

[Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series)series.

```
az aks nodepool show \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name mynodepool \
--query vmSize
```


The following example output shows the node pool uses Arm64:

```
"Standard_D2pds_v5"
```


## Next steps

# Autoscaling CoreDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to configure and customize CoreDNS autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## Configure CoreDNS horizontal pod scaling

Due to the elastic nature of AKS, it's common to experience sudden spikes in DNS traffic within your clusters. These spikes can lead to an increase in memory consumption by CoreDNS pods. In some cases, this increased memory consumption can cause `Out of memory`

issues.

To preempt this issue, AKS clusters autoscale CoreDNS pods to reduce memory usage per pod. The default settings for this autoscaling logic are stored in the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. However, you might observe that the default autoscaling of CoreDNS pods isn't always aggressive enough to prevent `Out of memory`

issues for your CoreDNS pods. In this case, you can directly modify the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. Keep in mind that simply increasing the number of CoreDNS pods without addressing the root cause of the `Out of memory`

issue might only provide a temporary fix. If there's not enough memory available across the nodes where the CoreDNS pods are running, increasing the number of CoreDNS pods won't help. You might need to investigate further and implement appropriate solutions such as optimizing resource usage, adjusting resource requests and limits, or adding more memory to the nodes.

CoreDNS uses the [horizontal cluster proportional autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler) for pod autoscaling. You can edit the `coredns-autoscaler`

to configure the scaling logic for the number of CoreDNS pods. The `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap currently supports two different ConfigMap key values: `linear`

and `ladder`

, which correspond to two supported control modes.

- The
`linear`

controller yields a number of replicas in [min,max] range equivalent to`max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

. - The
`ladder`

controller calculates the number of replicas by consulting two different step functions, one for core scaling and another for node scaling, yielding the max of the two replica values.

For more information on the control modes and ConfigMap format, see the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler#control-patterns-and-configmap-formats).

Important

We recommend a minimum of *two* CoreDNS pod replicas per cluster.

### View the current `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap

Get the current

`coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap using thecommand.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmap coredns-autoscaler --namespace kube-system --output yaml`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`apiVersion: v1 data: ladder: '{"coresToReplicas":[[1,2],[512,3],[1024,4],[2048,5]],"nodesToReplicas":[[1,2],[8,3],[16,4],[32,5]]}' kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-autoscaler namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "..." creationTimestamp: "..."`


Note

The configuration provided serves as a potential starting point, but you should customize the values based on your specific cluster requirements and DNS traffic patterns. One way to determine the appropriate number of replicas for your environment is to use the linear scaling formula: `replicas = max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

to determine replica counts based on core / node count in the cluster.

## CoreDNS vertical pod autoscaling behavior

CoreDNS uses the original provided resource requests/limits when enabling the [add-on autoscaling feature](optimized-addon-scaling) to prevent service unavailability during the CoreDNS pod restart process.

The following table outlines the default requests/limits and request-to-limit ratios for the AKS CoreDNS add-on:

| Resource | Requests/limits | Request-to-limit ratio |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | `100 m / 3 cores` |
Approximately 1:30 |
| Memory | `70 Mi / 500 Mi` |
Approximately 1:7 |

If the recommended CPU requests are *500 m*, VPA adjusts the CPU limits to *15* to maintain this ratio. Similarly, if the recommended memory requests are *700 Mi*, VPA adjusts the memory limit to *5000 Mi*.

VPA sets CoreDNS CPU and memory limits to large values based on the VPA recommended CPU/Memory request and AKS defined request-to-limit ratio. These adjustments are beneficial for handling multiple requests during peak service times. The drawback is that CoreDNS might consume all the CPU and memory available resource on the node when the peak service time.

It's difficult to set a single ideal CPU and memory requests/limits value to meet the requirements of both large cluster and small cluster at the same time. By enabling optimized add-on scaling, you have the flexibility to customize the CoreDNS CPU and memory requests/limits or use VPA to autoscale CoreDNS to meet specific cluster requirements. Keep the following scenarios in mind when deciding whether to customize the resource configuration or use VPA:

- You're considering whether VPA is suitable for your CoreDNS service and want to only view the VPA recommendations. You can disable VPA for CoreDNS by enabling the override VPA update mode to
*Off*if you don't want VPA to automatically update the pods.[Customize the resource configuration in Deployment](customize-resource-configuration)to set the CPU/Memory requests/limits to the value you prefer. - You're considering using VPA but want to restrict the ratio of request-to-limit so VPA won't bump the CPU and Memory limit to large values at one time. You can customize resources in the Deployment and update the CPU and Memory requests/limits value to keep the ratio of request-to-limit to
*1:2*or*1:3*. - If a VPA container policy sets maxAllowed CPU and Memory, the recommended resource requests won't exceed those limits. Customizing the resource configuration allows you to increase or decrease the maxAllowed values and control the recommendations of VPA.

For more information, see [Enable add-on autoscaling on your AKS cluster (Preview)](optimized-addon-scaling).

# AKS frequently asked questions

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Support

### Does AKS offer a service-level agreement?

AKS provides service-level agreement (SLA) guarantees in the [Standard pricing tier with the Uptime SLA feature](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

### What is platform support, and what does it include?

Platform support is a reduced support plan for unsupported n-3 version clusters. Platform support includes only Azure infrastructure support.

For more information, see the [platform support policy](supported-kubernetes-versions).

### Does AKS automatically upgrade my unsupported clusters?

Yes, AKS initiates auto-upgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where *n* is the latest supported AKS minor version that's generally available) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support policy.

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions](supported-kubernetes-versions), [Planned maintenance windows](planned-maintenance), and [Automatic upgrades](auto-upgrade-cluster).

### Can I apply Azure reservation discounts to my AKS agent nodes?

AKS agent nodes are billed as standard Azure virtual machines (VMs). If you purchased [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) for the VM size that you're using in AKS, those discounts are automatically applied.

## Operations

### Can I run Windows Server containers on AKS?

Yes, AKS supports Windows Server containers. For more information, see the [Windows Server on AKS FAQ](windows-faq).

### What Linux operating systems (OS) are supported on AKS?

AKS supports four main Linux operating systems, including Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), [Azure Linux OS Guard](use-azure-linux-os-guard), and [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks). When specifying `--os-type Linux`

during node pool creation or cluster creation, the default OS is Ubuntu Linux.

### What operating systems (OS) versions are supported on AKS?

When using `--os-sku Ubuntu`

, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 22.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.25-1.34. AKS defaults to Ubuntu 24.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.35+.
When using `--os-sku AzureLinux`

, AKS defaults to Azure Linux 3.0 in Kubernetes versions 1.32+.
In some scenarios, like FIPS-enabled node pools, the default OS version might differ. See [node images](node-images) for more information.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between Azure tenants?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between tenants is currently unsupported.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between subscriptions?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between subscriptions is currently unsupported.

### Can I move my AKS cluster or AKS infrastructure resources to other resource groups or rename them?

No. Moving or renaming your AKS cluster and its associated resources isn't supported.

### Can I restore my cluster after I delete it?

No. You can't restore your cluster after you delete it. When you delete your cluster, the node resource group and all its resources are also deleted.

If you want to keep any of your resources, move them to another resource group before you delete your cluster. If you want to protect against accidental deletes, you can lock the AKS managed resource group that's hosting your cluster resources by using [Node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown).

### Can I scale my AKS cluster to zero?

You can completely [stop a running AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster) or [scale or autoscale all or specific User node pools](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0) to zero.

You can't directly scale [system node pools](use-system-pools) to zero.

### Can I use the virtual machine scale set APIs to scale manually?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS APIs (`az aks scale`

).

### Can I use virtual machine scale sets to manually scale to zero nodes?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS API to scale nonsystem node pools to zero or [stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Can I stop or deallocate all my VMs?

No. This configuration isn't supported. [Stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Why are two resource groups created with AKS?

AKS builds upon many Azure infrastructure resources, including virtual machine scale sets, virtual networks, and managed disks. These integrations enable you to apply many of the core capabilities of the Azure platform within the managed Kubernetes environment provided by AKS. For example, you can use most Azure VM types directly with AKS, and you can use Azure Reservations to receive discounts on those resources automatically.

To enable this architecture, each AKS deployment spans two resource groups:

- You create the first resource group. This group contains only the Kubernetes service resource. The AKS resource provider automatically creates the second resource group during deployment. An example of the second resource group is
*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. For information on how to specify the name of this second resource group, see the next section. - The second resource group, known as the
*node resource group*, contains all of the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster. These resources include the Kubernetes node VMs, virtual networking, and storage. By default, the node resource group has a name like*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. AKS automatically deletes the node resource group whenever you delete the cluster. Use this resource group only for resources that share the cluster's lifecycle.

Note

Modifying any resource under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action and will cause cluster operation failures. You can prevent changes from being made to the node resource group. [Block users from modifying resources](node-resource-group-lockdown) that the AKS cluster manages.

### Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?

By default, AKS names the node resource group *MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location*, but you can provide your own name.

To specify your own resource group name, install the [aks-preview](/en-us/cli/azure/aks) Azure CLI extension version *0.3.2* or later. When you create an AKS cluster by using the `az aks create`

command, use the `--node-resource-group`

parameter and specify a name for the resource group. If you use an [Azure Resource Manager template](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/2022-09-01/managedclusters) to deploy an AKS cluster, you can define the resource group name by using the `nodeResourceGroup`

property.

- The Azure resource provider automatically creates the secondary resource group.
- You can specify a custom resource group name only when you create the cluster.

As you work with the node resource group, you can't:

- Specify an existing resource group for the node resource group.
- Specify a different subscription for the node resource group.
- Change the node resource group name after you create the cluster.
- Specify names for the managed resources within the node resource group.
- Modify or delete Azure-created tags of managed resources within the node resource group.

### Can I modify tags and other properties of the AKS resources in the node resource group?

You might get unexpected scaling and upgrading errors if you modify or delete Azure-created tags and other resource properties in the node resource group. AKS allows you to create and modify custom tags created by end users, and you can add those tags when you [create a node pool](manage-node-pools#specify-a-taint-label-or-tag-for-a-node-pool). You might want to create or modify custom tags, for example, to assign a business unit or cost center. Another option is to apply policies and modify tags through the AKS resource itself—specifically via the cluster and node pools..

Azure-created tags are created for their respective Azure services, and you should always allow them. For AKS, there are the `aks-managed`

and `k8s-azure`

tags. Modifying any *Azure-created tags* on resources under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action, which breaks the service-level objective (SLO).

Note

In the past, the tag name `Owner`

was reserved for AKS to manage the public IP that's assigned on the front-end IP of the load balancer. Now, services use the `aks-managed`

prefix. For legacy resources, don't use Azure policies to apply the `Owner`

tag name. Otherwise, all resources on your AKS cluster deployment and update operations will break. This restriction doesn't apply to newly created resources.

### Why do I see aks-managed prefixed Helm releases on my cluster, and why does their revision count keep increasing?

AKS uses Helm to deliver components to your cluster. You can safely ignore `aks-managed`

prefixed Helm releases. Continuously increasing revisions on these Helm releases are expected and safe.

## Quotas, limits, and region availability

### Which Azure regions currently provide AKS?

For a complete list of available regions, see [AKS regions and availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across regions?

No. AKS clusters are regional resources and can't span regions. For guidance on how to create an architecture that includes multiple regions, see [best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery](operator-best-practices-multi-region#plan-for-multiregion-deployment).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across availability zones?

Yes, you can deploy an AKS cluster across one or more [availability zones](availability-zones) in [regions that support them](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

### Can I have different VM sizes in a single cluster?

Yes, you can use different VM sizes in your AKS cluster by creating [multiple node pools](create-node-pools).

### What's the size limit on a container image in AKS?

AKS doesn't set a limit on the container image size. But the larger the image, the higher the memory demand. A larger size could potentially exceed resource limits or the overall available memory of worker nodes. By default, memory for VM size Standard_DS2_v2 for an AKS cluster is set to 7 GiB.

When a container image is excessively large, as in the terabyte (TB) range, the kubelet might not be able to pull it from your container registry to a node because of the lack of disk space.

For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update doesn't automatically run and apply the latest updates. You should perform an upgrade on the cluster and the Windows Server node pools in your AKS cluster. Follow a regular schedule based on the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, and then removes the older nodes. For more information on this process, see [Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

### Are AKS images required to run as root?

The following images have functional requirements to run as root, and exceptions must be filed for any policies:

*mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/coredns**mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/calico/node**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes-csi/azuredisk-csi*

## Security, access, and identity

### Can I limit who has access to the Kubernetes API server?

Yes, there are two options for limiting access to the API server:

- Use
[API server authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges)if you want to maintain a public endpoint for the API server but restrict access to a set of trusted IP ranges. - Use a
[private cluster](private-clusters)if you want to limit the API server to be accessible*only*from within your virtual network.

### Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes?

AKS patches CVEs that have a *vendor fix* every week. CVEs without a fix are waiting on a vendor fix before they can be remediated. The AKS images are automatically updated within 30 days. We recommend that you apply an updated node image on a regular cadence to ensure that the latest patched images and OS patches are all applied and current. You can do this task:

- Manually, through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
- By upgrading your AKS cluster. The cluster upgrades
[cordon and drain nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)automatically. Then it brings a new node online with the latest Ubuntu image and a new patch version or a minor Kubernetes version. For more information, see[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster). - By using a
[node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade).

### Are there security threats that target AKS that I should be aware of?

Microsoft provides guidance for other actions that you can take to secure your workloads through services like [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks). For information on a security threat related to AKS and Kubernetes, see [New large-scale campaign targets Kubeflow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/new-large-scale-campaign-targets-kubeflow/ba-p/2425750) (June 8, 2021).

### Does AKS store any customer data outside the cluster's region?

No. All data is stored in the cluster's region.

### How can I avoid permission ownership setting slow issues when the volume has numerous files?

Traditionally, if your pod is running as a nonroot user (which it should), you must specify an `fsGroup`

parameter inside the pod's security context so that the volume is readable and writable by the pod. For more information on this requirement, see [Configure a security context for a pod or container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

A side effect of setting `fsGroup`

is that each time a volume is mounted, Kubernetes must use the `chown()`

and `chmod()`

commands recursively for all the files and directories inside the volume (with a few exceptions). This scenario happens even if group ownership of the volume already matches the requested `fsGroup`

parameter. This configuration might be expensive for larger volumes with lots of small files, which can cause pod startup to take a long time. This scenario was a known problem before v1.20. The workaround is to set the pod to run as root:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: security-context-demo
spec:
securityContext:
runAsUser: 0
fsGroup: 0
```


The issue was resolved with Kubernetes version 1.20. For more information, see [Kubernetes 1.20: Granular control of volume permission changes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/14/kubernetes-release-1.20-fsgroupchangepolicy-fsgrouppolicy/).

## Networking

### How does the managed control plane communicate with my nodes?

AKS uses a secure tunnel communication to allow the `api-server`

and individual node kubelets to communicate, even on separate virtual networks. The tunnel is secured through mutual Transport Layer Security encryption. The current main tunnel that AKS uses is [Konnectivity, previously known as apiserver-network-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/). Verify that all network rules follow the [Azure required network rules and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)](limit-egress-traffic).

### Can my pods use the API server FQDN instead of the cluster IP?

Yes, you can add the annotation `kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

to pods to set the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`

variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This modification is useful in cases where your cluster egress is done via a layer 7 firewall. An example is when you use Azure Firewall with application rules.

### Can I configure NSGs with AKS?

AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. AKS modifies only the network interface NSG settings. If you're using Container Network Interface (CNI), you also must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod classless interdomain routing (CIDR) ranges. If you're using kubenet, you must also ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod CIDR. For more information, see [Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

### How does time synchronization work in AKS?

AKS nodes run the chrony service, which pulls time from the local host. Containers that run on pods get the time from the AKS nodes. Applications that open inside a container use time from the container of the pod.

## Add-ons, extensions, and integrations

### Can I use custom VM extensions?

No. AKS is a managed service. Manipulation of the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources isn't supported. To install custom components, use the Kubernetes APIs and mechanisms. For example, use DaemonSets to install any required components.

### What Kubernetes admission controllers does AKS support? Can admission controllers be added or removed?

AKS supports the following [admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/):

`NamespaceLifecycle`

`LimitRanger`

`ServiceAccount`

`DefaultIngressClass`

`DefaultStorageClass`

`DefaultTolerationSeconds`

`MutatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ResourceQuota`

`PodNodeSelector`

`PodTolerationRestriction`

`ExtendedResourceToleration`


Currently, you can't modify the list of admission controllers in AKS.

### Can I use admission controller webhooks on AKS?

Yes, you can use admission controller webhooks on AKS. We recommend that you exclude internal AKS namespaces, which are marked with the `control-plane`

label. For example:

```
namespaceSelector:
matchExpressions:
- key: control-plane
operator: DoesNotExist
```


AKS firewalls the API server egress so that your admission controller webhooks need to be accessible from within the cluster.

### Can admission controller webhooks affect kube-system and internal AKS namespaces?

To protect the stability of the system and prevent custom admission controllers from affecting internal services in the `kube-system`

namespace, AKS has an admissions enforcer, which automatically excludes `kube-system`

and AKS internal namespaces. This service ensures that the custom admission controllers don't affect the services that run in `kube-system`

.

If you have a critical use case for deploying something on `kube-system`

(not recommended) in support of your custom admission webhook, you can add the following label or annotation so that the admissions enforcer ignores it:

- Label:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": "true"`

- Annotation:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": true`


### Is Azure Key Vault integrated with AKS?

[Azure Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver](csi-secrets-store-driver) provides native integration of Azure Key Vault into AKS.

### Can I use FIPS cryptographic libraries with deployments on AKS?

Nodes that are enabled with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are now supported on Linux-based node pools. For more information, see [Add a FIPS-enabled node pool](enable-fips-nodes).

### How are AKS add-ons updated?

Any patch, including a security patch, is automatically applied to the AKS cluster. Anything bigger than a patch, like major or minor version changes (which can have breaking changes to your deployed objects), are updated when you update your cluster if a new release is available. For information on when a new release is available, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

### What is the purpose of the AKS Linux extension that I see installed on my Linux virtual machine scale sets instances?

The AKS Linux extension is an Azure VM extension that installs and configures monitoring tools on Kubernetes worker nodes. The extension is installed on all new and existing Linux nodes. It configures the following monitoring tools:

[Node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): Collects hardware telemetry from the VM and makes it available by using a metrics endpoint. Then, a monitoring tool, such as Prometheus, can scrap these metrics.[Node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector): Aims to make various node problems visible to upstream layers in the cluster management stack. It's a systemd unit that runs on each node, detects node problems, and reports them to the cluster's API server by using`Events`

and`NodeConditions`

.[ig](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2260320): Is an eBPF-powered open-source framework for debugging and observing Linux and Kubernetes systems. It provides a set of tools (or gadgets) that gather relevant information that users can use to identify the cause of performance issues, crashes, or other anomalies. Notably, its independence from Kubernetes enables users to employ it also for debugging control plane issues.

These tools help provide observability around many node health-related problems, such as:

**Infrastructure daemon issues:**NTP service down**Hardware issues:**Bad CPU, memory, or disk**Kernel issues:**Kernel deadlock, corrupted file system**Container runtime issues:**Unresponsive runtime daemon

The extension *doesn't require extra outbound access* to any URLs, IP addresses, or ports beyond the [documented AKS egress requirements](limit-egress-traffic). It doesn't require any special permissions granted in Azure. It uses `kubeconfig`

to connect to the API server to send the monitoring data that's collected.

## Troubleshoot cluster issues

### Why is it taking so long to delete my cluster?

Most clusters are deleted upon user request. In some cases, especially cases where you bring your own resource group or perform cross-resource group tasks, deletion can take more time or even fail. If you have an issue with deletions, double-check that you don't have locks on the resource group. Also make sure that any resources outside the resource group are disassociated from the resource group.

### Why is it taking so long to create or update my cluster?

If you have issues with creating and updating clusters, make sure that you don't have any assigned policies or service constraints that might block your AKS cluster from managing resources like VMs, load balancers, or tags.

### If I have pods or deployments in NodeLost or Unknown states, can I still upgrade my cluster?

You can, but we don't recommend it. Perform updates when the state of the cluster is known and healthy.

### If I have a cluster with one or more nodes in an Unhealthy state, or if it's shut down, can I perform an upgrade?

No. Delete or remove any nodes that are in a failed state or otherwise from the cluster before you upgrade.

### I tried to delete my cluster, but I see the error "[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed."

Most commonly, this error arises if you have one or more NSGs in use that are still associated with the cluster. Remove them and attempt to delete the cluster again.

### I ran an upgrade, but now my pods are in crash loops and readiness probes fail.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

### My cluster was working, but suddenly I can't provision load balancers or mount persistent volume claims.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

## Retirements and deprecations

### Which Linux OS versions are deprecated on AKS?

Starting on March 17, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=485795).

An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configured with API Server VNet Integration projects the API server endpoint directly into a delegated subnet in the VNet where AKS is deployed. API Server VNet Integration enables network communication between the API server and the cluster nodes without requiring a private link or tunnel. The API server is available behind an internal load balancer VIP in the delegated subnet, which the nodes are configured to utilize. By using API Server VNet Integration, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only.

## API server connectivity

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure subscription. Your cluster or node pool is in your Azure subscription. The server and the virtual machines that make up the cluster nodes can communicate with each other through the API server VIP and pod IPs that are projected into the delegated subnet.

API Server VNet Integration is supported for public or private clusters. You can add or remove public access after cluster provisioning. Unlike non-VNet integrated clusters, the agent nodes always communicate directly with the private IP address of the API server internal load balancer (ILB) IP without using DNS. All node to API server traffic is kept on private networking, and no tunnel is required for API server to node connectivity. Out-of-cluster clients needing to communicate with the API server can do so normally if public network access is enabled. If public network access is disabled, you should follow the same private DNS setup methodology as standard [private clusters](private-clusters).

## Prerequisites

- You must have Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed. You can check your version using the
`az --version`

command.

## Limitations

- API Server VNet Integration does not support
[Virtual Network Encryption](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview). Clusters deployed on**v3 or earlier AKS node SKUs**(which do not support VNet Encryption) are allowed but traffic will not be encrypted. Clusters deployed on**v4 or later AKS node SKUs**(which support VNet Encryption) are blocked because encrypted VNets are incompatible with API Server VNet Integration. See[AKS supported VM SKUs](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes)for details.

## Availability

- API Server VNet Integration is available in all GA public cloud regions except qatarcentral.

## Create an AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using managed VNet

You can configure your AKS clusters with API Server VNet Integration in managed VNet or bring-your-own VNet mode. You can create them as public clusters (with API server access available via a public IP) or private clusters (where the API server is only accessible via private VNet connectivity). You can also toggle between a public and private state without redeploying your cluster.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location westus2 --name <resource-group>`


### Deploy a public cluster

Deploy a public AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration for managed VNet using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Deploy a private cluster

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using bring-your-own VNet

When using bring-your-own VNet, you must create and delegate an API server subnet to `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same virtual network. The minimum supported API server subnet size is a */28*.

The cluster identity needs permissions to both the API server subnet and the node subnet. Lack of permissions at the API server subnet can cause a provisioning failure.

Warning

An AKS cluster reserves at least 9 IPs in the subnet address space. Running out of IP addresses may prevent API server scaling and cause an API server outage.

### Create a resource group

- Create a resource group using the
command.`az group create`


```
az group create --location <location> --name <resource-group>
```


### Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`az network vnet create --name <vnet-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/16`

Create an API server subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <apiserver-subnet-name> \ --delegations Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/28`

Create a cluster subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <cluster-subnet-name> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.1.0/24`


### Create a managed identity and give it permissions on the virtual network

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <managed-identity-name> --location <location>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the API server subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the cluster subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`


### Deploy a public cluster

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --vnet-subnet-id <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --assign-identity <managed-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Convert an existing AKS cluster to API Server VNet Integration

Warning

**API Server VNet Integration is a one-way, capacity-sensitive feature.**

**Manual restart required.**

After enabling API Server VNet Integration using`az aks update --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

, due to control plane resource transition, you must immediately restart the cluster for the change to take effect. This restart is not automated. Delaying the restart increases the risk of capacity becoming unavailable, which can prevent the API server from starting. The cluster restart also ensures that all nodes reliably reconnect to the new API server endpoint.**Capacity is validated, but not reserved.**

AKS validates regional capacity when you enable the feature on an existing cluster, but this validation does not reserve capacity. If the restart is delayed and capacity becomes unavailable in the meantime, the cluster may fail to start after a stop or restart. Clusters that enabled this feature before general availability (GA), or that have not yet restarted since enablement, will not undergo capacity validation.**Feature cannot be disabled.**

Once enabled, the feature is permanent. You cannot disable API Server VNet Integration.

This upgrade performs a node-image version upgrade on all node pools and restarts all workloads while they undergo a rolling image upgrade.

Warning

Converting a cluster to API Server VNet Integration results in a change of the API Server IP address, though the hostname remains the same. If the IP address of the API server has been configured in any firewalls or network security group rules, those rules may need to be updated.

Update your cluster to API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


## Enable or disable private cluster mode on an existing cluster with API Server VNet Integration

AKS clusters configured with API Server VNet Integration can have public network access/private cluster mode enabled or disabled without redeploying the cluster. The API server hostname doesn't change, but public DNS entries are modified or removed if necessary.

Note

`--disable-private-cluster`

is currently in preview. For more information, see [Reference and support levels](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-types-and-status).

### Enable private cluster mode

Enable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


### Disable private cluster mode

Disable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --disable-private-cluster`


## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name>`


## Expose the API server through Private Link

You can expose the API server endpoint of a private cluster with API Server VNet Integration using Azure Private Link. The following steps show how to create a Private Link Service (PLS) in the cluster VNet and connect to it from another VNet or subscription using a Private Endpoint.

### Create an API Server VNet Integration Private cluster

Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`


For more guidance on how to set up Private Link with API Server VNet Integration, see [Private Link with API Server VNet Integration](private-apiserver-vnet-integration-cluster).

## NSG security rules

All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. But if you have added NSG rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, ensure that the NSG security rules permit the following types of communication:

| Destination | Source | Protocol | Port | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Cluster Subnet | TCP | 443 and 4443 | Required to enable communication between Nodes and the API server. |
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Azure Load Balancer | TCP | 9988 | Required to enable communication between Azure Load Balancer and the API server. You can also enable all communications between the Azure Load Balancer and the API Server Subnet CIDR. |

# Simplified application autoscaling with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple and is a Cloud Native Computing Federation (CNCF) Graduate project.

It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.

The KEDA add-on makes it even easier by deploying a managed KEDA installation, providing you with [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) that you can scale your applications with on your Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster.

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.32.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Architecture

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/) provides two main components:

**KEDA operator**allows end-users to scale workloads in or out from 0 to N instances with support for Kubernetes Deployments, Jobs,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource.**Metrics server**exposes external metrics to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes for autoscaling purposes such as messages in a Kafka topic, or number of events in an Azure event hub. Due to upstream limitations, KEDA must be the only installed external metric adapter.


Learn more about how KEDA works in the [official KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/).

## Installation

KEDA can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the KEDA add-on using an [ARM template](keda-deploy-add-on-arm) or [Azure CLI](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

The KEDA add-on provides a fully supported installation of KEDA that is integrated with AKS.

## Capabilities and features

KEDA provides the following capabilities and features:

- Build sustainable and cost-efficient applications with scale-to-zero
- Scale application workloads to meet demand using
[a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) - Autoscale applications with
`ScaledObjects`

, such as Deployments,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource - Autoscale job-like workloads with
`ScaledJobs`

- Use production-grade security by decoupling autoscaling authentication from workloads
- Bring-your-own external scaler to use tailor-made autoscaling decisions
- Integrate with
[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview)for authentication

Note

If you plan to use workload identity, [enable the workload identity add-on](workload-identity-deploy-cluster) before enabling the KEDA add-on.

## Add-on limitations

The KEDA AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- KEDA's
[HTTP add-on (preview)](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on)to scale HTTP workloads isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - KEDA's
[external scaler for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)to scale based on Azure Cosmos DB change feed isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - Only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of that the KEDA add-on should be the only external metrics server inside the cluster.
- Multiple KEDA installations aren't supported

- It's not recommended to combine KEDA's
`ScaledObject`

with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload. They compete with each other because KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in the background and results in odd scaling behavior.- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created and the KEDA`ScaledObject`

would fail to be created. - If a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created first and then an HPA is created, the HPA creation isn't blocked.

- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA

For general KEDA questions, we recommend [visiting the FAQ overview](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/reference/faq/).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Supported Kubernetes and KEDA versions

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version is installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use.

# Scale node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As your application workload demands change, you might need to scale the number of nodes in a node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this article, you learn how to manually and automatically scale node pools in AKS.

## Prerequisites for AKS node pool scaling

- An existing AKS cluster with at least one node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with node pools](create-node-pools). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Scale a node pool manually

Scale the number of nodes in a node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool scale`

][az-aks-nodepool-scale] command. The`--node-count`

flag specifies the desired number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the node pool is scaled to five nodes.`az aks nodepool scale \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --node-count 5 \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pools using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Scaling*state with a new count of five nodes:`[ { ... "count": 5, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Scaling", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes for the scale operation to complete. After the scale operation is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Scale a node pool automatically with the cluster autoscaler

You can use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) with multiple node pools, and you can enable it on individual node pools and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

flag. The`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

flags specify the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the cluster autoscaler is enabled with a minimum count of one node and a maximum count of five nodes:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

If you want to disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool, use the [`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the `--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

flag instead of `--update-cluster-autoscaler`

.

## Next steps: Manage node pools in AKS

# Best practices for network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes, by default, operates as a flat network where all pods can communicate freely with each other. This unrestricted connectivity can be convenient for developers but poses significant security risks as applications scale. Imagine an organization deploying multiple microservices, each handling sensitive data, customer transactions, or backend operations. Without any restrictions, any compromised pod could potentially access unauthorized data or disrupt services.

To address these security concerns, [Network Policies in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow administrators to control and restrict traffic between workloads. They provide a declarative way to enforce traffic rules, ensuring secure and controlled network behavior within a cluster.

## What is Kubernetes Network Policy?

A Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that control how pods communicate with each other and with external services. It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, allowing administrators to enforce security and segmentation at the namespace level. By implementing Network Policies, you gain:

**Stronger security posture**: Prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the cluster.**Compliance and governance**: Enforce regulatory requirements by controlling communication pathways.**Reduced blast radius**: Limit the impact of a compromised workload by restricting its network access.

Initially, Network Policies were designed to operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model, enabling basic control over pod-to-pod and external communications. However, advanced network policy engines like Cilium have extended Network Policies to Layer 7 (Application Layer), allowing deeper control over application traffic for modern cloud-native applications.

Network Policies are defined at the namespace level, meaning each policy applies to workloads within a specific namespace. The main components of a Network Policy include:

**Pod selector**: Defines which pods the policy applies to based on labels.**Ingress rules**: Specify the allowed incoming connections.**Egress rules**: Specify the allowed outgoing connections.**Policy types**: Define whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming), egress (outgoing), or both.

## Foundations of building effective network policies

Building effective network policies in Kubernetes isn't just about writing YAML configurations—it requires a deep understanding of your application architecture, traffic patterns, and security requirements. Without a clear picture of how workloads communicate, enforcing security policies can lead to unintended disruptions or gaps in protection. The following sections cover how to systematically approach network policy design.

### Understanding your workload connectivity

Before implementing network policies, you need visibility into how workloads communicate with each other and external services. This step ensures that policies don’t inadvertently block critical traffic while effectively limiting unnecessary exposure.

**Leverage Visibility Tools:**in addition to the network requirements provided by application team you can use tools like[Cilium Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble), and[Retina](https://retina.sh/)help you analyze pod-to-pod traffic, identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database. Identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database.**The importance of labels in network policies:**Traditionally, network security policies have relied on static IP addresses to define traffic rules. This approach is problematic in Kubernetes because pods are ephemeral—created and destroyed frequently, often with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Maintaining security rules based on constantly changing IPs would require continuous updates, making policy management inefficient and error-prone.

Labels solve this challenge by providing a stable way to group workloads. Instead of relying on fixed IPs, Kubernetes Network Policies use labels to define security rules that remain consistent even as pods restart or shift across nodes. For example, a policy can allow communication between pods labeled `app: frontend`

and `app: backend`

, ensuring traffic flows as intended regardless of pod IP changes. This label-based approach is critical for achieving scalable, intent-driven network security in cloud-native environments.

A well-defined labeling strategy simplifies policy management, reduces misconfigurations, and enhances security enforcement across clusters.

**Define Micro-segmentation:**Organizing workloads into security zones (e.g., frontend, backend, database) helps enforce the principle of least privilege. For instance, microservices handling customer transactions should be isolated from general-purpose applications.

### Layered security approach for Kubernetes

Relying solely on basic Kubernetes Network Policies might not be sufficient for all security needs. A layered approach ensures comprehensive protection across different levels of network communication.

**(L3/L4) policies**: The foundation of network security, controlling traffic based on pod labels and namespaces at the IP, port, and protocol level.**FQDN-based policies**: Restrict egress traffic to specific external domains, ensuring workloads can only reach approved external services (for example: only allowing access to*microsoft.com*for API calls).**Layer 7 policies**: Introduces fine-grained control over traffic by filtering requests based on HTTP methods, headers, and paths. This is useful for securing APIs and enforcing application-layer security policies.

### Management of Network Policies

Who should manage network policies? This often depends on an organization’s structure and security requirements. A well-balanced approach allows both security teams and application developers to collaborate effectively.

**Centralized security administration**: Security or networking teams should define baseline policies to enforce global security requirements, such as default deny-all rules or compliance-driven restrictions.**Developer autonomy with guardrails**: Application teams should be able to define service-specific network policies within their namespaces, enabling security while maintaining agility.**Policy lifecycle management**: Regularly reviewing and updating policies ensures that security remains aligned with evolving application architectures. Observability tools can help detect policy misconfigurations and missing rules.

#### Example: Securing a multi-tier web application with Network Policies

**Step 1: Understanding workload connectivity**

- Visibility tools: Use Cilium Hubble to observe how pods communicate.


Mapping connectivity:

Source Destination Protocol Port Frontend Backend TCP 8080 Backend Database TCP 5432 Backend External Payment Gateway TCP 443

**Step 2: Applying labels for policy enforcement**

By labeling workloads correctly, policies can remain stable even if pod IPs change.

`app: frontend`

for UI pods.`app: backend`

for API pods.`app: database`

for DB pods.

**Step 3: Implementing application-level Network Policies**

In this example, we use two layers of network policies: an L3/L4 basic policy to control traffic between microservices and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) policy to control egress traffic with external payment gateway.

| Allow frontend to communicate with backend | Allow backend to access the database | Allow backend to reach external payment API |
|---|---|---|
Policy 1: Frontend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` Policy 2: Backend ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: frontend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` |
Policy 1: Backend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: database` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` Policy 2: Database ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` |
Policy 1: Backend`spec:` ` endpointSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` egress:` ` - toFQDNs:` ` - matchName: payments.example.com` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 443` |

**Step 4: Managing and maintaining policies**

Security and platform teams enforce baseline deny rules.

## Azure Powered by Cilium

[Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security for Kubernetes workloads. Unlike traditional CNIs that rely on iptables-based packet filtering, Azure CNI powered by Cilium uses eBPF to operate at the kernel level, enabling efficient and scalable network policy enforcement. On Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cilium is the only supported network policy engine, reflecting Azure’s investment in performance, scalability, and security.
Azure Kubernetes Service integrates Cilium as a managed component, simplifying network security enforcement. Administrators can define Cilium Network Policies directly within their AKS clusters without requiring external controllers.

Cilium extends the usage of labels with Identities. Large clusters with many pods might experience scale issues where constantly updating IP filters occurs with a high pod churn rate. Under the hood, Identities map to labels and allow connections to initiate as soon as the identity resolves rather than needing to update rules on nodes.

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

Use the following command to create a cluster with Azure CNI powered by cilium

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Anatomy of the Cilium Network Policy

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium, you can configure network policies natively in Kubernetes using two available formats:

**The standard**, which supports L3 and L4 policies at ingress or egress of the Pod.`NetworkPolicy`

resource**The extended**, which is available as a CustomResourceDefinition that supports specification of policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

format

With these CRDs, we can define security policies, and Kubernetes automatically distributes these policies to all the nodes in the cluster.

A Network Policy consists of several key components:

**Pod selector**: Specifies which pods the policy applies to using labels.**Policy types**: Determines whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming traffic), egress (outgoing traffic), or both.**Ingress rules**: Defines allowed sources (pods, namespaces, or IP ranges) and ports.**Egress rules**: Defines allowed destinations and ports.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: frontend-egress namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: frontend policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080`


## Advanced Network Policy

Azure Kubernetes services offers the [Advanced Container Networking Service (ACNS)](/en-us/azure/aks/advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium) a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of AKS clusters.

A key feature of ACNS is Container Network Security, which offers advanced security functionalities to safeguard containerized workloads. One notable aspect is the ability to implement advanced network policies, including Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering and Layer 7 (L7) policies, allowing for more granular control over both egress traffic and application-layer communication.

### Secure Egress traffic with FQDN Filtering

Traditionally, network policies in Kubernetes are based on IP addresses. However, in dynamic environments where pod IPs frequently change, managing such policies becomes cumbersome. [FQDN filtering](/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-concepts#overview-of-fqdn-filtering) simplifies this by allowing policies to be defined using domain names instead of IP addresses. This approach provides a more intuitive and user-friendly method of controlling network traffic, allowing organizations to enforce security policies with greater precision and flexibility.

Implementing FQDN filtering in AKS clusters requires enabling ACNS and configuring the necessary policies to define allowed or blocked domains, thereby enhancing the security posture of your containerized applications.

To enable Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), use the flag --enable-acns

#### Example: Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Build a network policy that allows traffic to “bing.com”

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


### Protection and security for APIs with L7 policies

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication, securing these interactions at the network layer alone is no longer sufficient. Standard network policies operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), controlling which pods can communicate, but they lack visibility into the actual API requests being made.

Layer 7 (L7) policies provide the following benefits and features:

**Granular API security**: Enforce policies based on HTTP, gRPC, or Kafka request data, rather than just IP addresses and ports.**Reduced attack surface**: Prevent unauthorized access and mitigate API-based attacks by filtering traffic at the application layer.**Compliance and auditing**: Ensure adherence to security standards by logging and controlling specific API interactions.**Simplified policy management**: Avoid the operational burden of additional sidecar proxies by leveraging built-in Cilium-powered L7 controls.

L7 policies AKS are enabled through ACNS and are available to customers using Azure CNI powered by Cilium. These policies support HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka protocols.

To enforce L7 policies, customers define `CiliumNetworkPolicy`

resources, specifying rules for application-layer traffic control.

#### Example: Enable ACNS on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Allow only GET requests to /api from the frontend pod to the backend service on port 8080

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


## Strategies for network policies

Securing Kubernetes workloads requires a thoughtful approach to defining and enforcing network policies. A well-designed strategy ensures that applications communicate only as intended, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and potential breaches. The following sections cover key strategies for implementing effective Kubernetes Network Policies.

### Adopt a Zero-Trust model

By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted communication between all pods in a cluster. A Zero-Trust approach dictates that no traffic should be trusted by default, and only explicitly allowed communication paths should be permitted. Implementing a default deny-all network policy ensures that only necessary traffic flows between workloads.

Example of a deny-all policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
- Egress
```


### Namespace and multi-tenancy segmentation

In multi-tenant environments, namespaces help isolate workloads. Different teams typically manage their applications within dedicated namespaces, ensuring logical isolation between workloads. This separation is critical when multiple applications run alongside each other. Applying network policies at the namespace scope is often the first step in securing workloads, as it prevents unrestricted lateral movement between applications managed by different teams.

For example, restrict all ingress traffic to a namespace, allowing only traffic from the same namespace:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: restrict-cross-namespace
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
- namespaceSelector:
matchLabels:
name: team-a
```


### Microsegmentation for workload isolation

While namespace-based segmentation is an essential first step in securing multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, application-level microsegmentation provides fine-grained control over how workloads interact within a namespace. Namespace isolation alone does not prevent unintended or unauthorized communication between different applications within the same namespace. This is where pod-level segmentation becomes critical.

For instance, if a frontend service should only talk to a backend service within the same namespace, a policy using pod labels can enforce this restriction:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-to-backend
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 8080
```


This prevents frontend pods from making unintended connections to other services, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement inside the namespace.

By combining namespace-wide isolation with fine-grained application-level policies, teams can implement a multi-layered security model that prevents unauthorized traffic while allowing necessary communication for application functionality.

### Layered security approach

Network security should be implemented in layers, combining multiple levels of enforcement:

**L3/L4 policies**: Restrict traffic at the IP and port level (for example: allow TCP traffic on port 443).**FQDN-based filtering**: Restrict external communication based on domain names rather than IP addresses.**L7 policies**: Control communication based on application-layer attributes (for example: allow only HTTP GET requests to specific API paths).

For example, a Cilium L7 policy can restrict frontend services to only issue GET requests to the backend API:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


This prevents the frontend from making POST or DELETE requests, limiting the attack surface.

### Integrating RBAC with Network Policy management

Role-based access control (RBAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users or teams can create, modify, or delete network policies. Without proper access controls, a misconfigured policy could either expose workloads to unauthorized access or unintentionally block critical application traffic.

By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC in conjunction with network policies, organizations can enforce separation of duties between platform administrators, security teams, and application developers. A typical approach is:

- Platform or security teams define baseline security policies that enforce compliance and restrict external access.
- Application teams are granted limited permissions to create or update network policies only for their respective namespaces.

For example, the following RBAC policy allows developers to create and modify network policies but only within their assigned namespace:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: network-policy-editor
namespace: team-a
rules:
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
resources: ["networkpolicies"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```


This role can then be bound to a specific team using a RoleBinding:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
name: team-a-network-policy-binding
namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer@example.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: network-policy-editor
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


By restricting network policy modifications to designated teams and namespaces, organizations can prevent accidental misconfigurations or unauthorized changes while still allowing flexibility for developers to implement application-specific security policies.

This approach reinforces the principle of least privilege while ensuring that network segmentation strategies remain consistent, secure, and aligned with organizational policies.

## Legacy and third-party solutions

### Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)

Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) is a legacy solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies on AKS. As we continue to evolve our networking stack, we intend to deprecate NPM soon.

We strongly recommend all customers transition to Cilium Network Policy, which provides better performance, scalability, and enhanced security through eBPF-based enforcement. Cilium is the future of network policy in AKS and offers a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to NPM.

### NetworkPolicy support for Windows nodes

AKS doesn't natively support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Windows nodes out of the box. To enable network policies for Windows workloads, you can use Calico for Windows nodes, which is integrated into AKS to simplify deployment. You can enable it using the `--network-policy calico`

flag when creating a cluster.

Microsoft doesn't maintain the Calico images used in this integration. Our support is limited to ensuring Calico is properly integrated with AKS and functions as expected within the platform. Any issues related to Calico upstream bugs, feature requests, or troubleshooting beyond AKS integration should be directed to the Calico open-source community or Tigera, the maintainers of Calico.

### Calico open source – Third-party solution

Calico open source is a widely used third-party solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies. It supports both Linux and Windows nodes and provides advanced networking and security capabilities, including network policy enforcement, workload identity, and encryption.

While Calico is integrated with AKS for Windows network policies (`--network-policy calico`

), it remains an open-source project maintained by Tigera. Microsoft doesn't maintain Calico images and provides limited support focused on ensuring proper integration with AKS. For advanced troubleshooting, feature requests, or issues beyond AKS integration, we recommend reaching out to the Calico open-source community or Tigera.

For Linux nodes, we strongly recommend using Cilium for network policy enforcement. For Windows nodes, we recommend using Calico.

## Conclusion

Network policies are a fundamental part of Kubernetes security, enabling organizations to control traffic flow, enforce workload isolation, and reduce the attack surface. As cloud-native environments evolve, relying solely on basic Layer 3/4 policies is no longer sufficient. Advanced solutions, such as Layer 7 filtering and FQDN-based policies, provide the granular security and flexibility needed to protect modern applications.

By following best practices including zero-trust model, microsegmentation, and adopting scalable solutions like Azure managed Cilium teams can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. As Kubernetes networking continues to evolve, adopting modern, observability-driven approaches will be key to securing workloads effectively.

# Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create extension instances in an AKS cluster, setting required and optional parameters including options related to updates and configurations. You can also view, list, update, and delete extension instances.

Before you begin, read about [cluster extensions](cluster-extensions).

Note

The examples provided in this article are not complete, and are only meant to showcase functionality. For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, see the [az k8s-extension CLI reference](/en-us/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).The

`Microsoft.ContainerService`

and`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

resource providers must be registered on your subscription. To register these providers, run the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --wait az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait`

An AKS cluster. This cluster must have been created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters. For new clusters created with

`az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters, switch to manage identity by running`az aks update`

with the`--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see[Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version >= 2.16.0 installed. We recommend using the latest version.The latest version of the

`k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extensions. Install the extension by running the following command:`az extension add --name k8s-extension`

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

# Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{

"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",

- Update the outbound IP address or idle timeout using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

or`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameter.

The following example updates the NAT gateway managed outbound IP count for the AKS cluster to 5.

## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ... "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" }`


## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx/agentPools/mynpxxx", "name": "mynpxxx", "osType": "Windows", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools" }`

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet frequently asked questions

**Can I deploy VMs in my cluster subnet?**Yes for Azure CNI Node Subnet, the VMs can be deployed in the same subnet as the AKS cluster.

**What source IP do external systems see for traffic that originates in an Azure CNI-enabled pod?**Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. But for

[Azure CNI dynamic IP allocation](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet#dynamic-ip-allocation-mode), no matter the connection is inside the same virtual network or cross virtual networks, the pod IP is always the source address for any traffic from the pod. This is because the[Azure CNI for dynamic IP allocation](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet#dynamic-ip-allocation-mode)implements[Microsoft Azure Container Networking](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking)infrastructure, which gives end-to-end experience. Hence, it eliminates the use of, which is still used by traditional Azure CNI.`ip-masq-agent`

**Can I use a different subnet within my cluster virtual network for the***Kubernetes service address range*?It's not recommended, but this configuration is possible. The service address range is a set of virtual IPs (VIPs) that Kubernetes assigns to internal services in your cluster. Azure Networking has no visibility into the service IP range of the Kubernetes cluster. The lack of visibility into the cluster's service address range can lead to issues. It's possible to later create a new subnet in the cluster virtual network that overlaps with the service address range. If such an overlap occurs, Kubernetes could assign a service an IP that's already in use by another resource in the subnet, causing unpredictable behavior or failures. By ensuring you use an address range outside the cluster's virtual network, you can avoid this overlap risk. Yes, when you deploy a cluster with the Azure CLI or a Resource Manager template. See

# Overview of FQDN filtering

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors

If the extension fails to create or update, try suggestions and solutions in the [Azure App Configuration extension troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/extensions/troubleshoot-app-configuration-extension-installation-errors).

## Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider errors via the [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#troubleshooting).

## Delete the extension

If you need to delete the extension and remove Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider from your AKS cluster, you can use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --cluster-type managedClusters --name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider
```

# Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects unscheduled pods, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demand. It also regularly checks nodes that don't have any scheduled pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article helps you understand how the cluster autoscaler works in AKS. It also provides guidance, best practices, and considerations when configuring the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads. If you want to enable, disable, or update the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

## About the cluster autoscaler

Clusters often need a way to scale automatically to adjust to changing application demands, such as between workdays and evenings or weekends. AKS clusters can scale in the following ways:

- The
**cluster autoscaler**periodically checks for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. Manual scaling is disabled when you use the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see[How does scale up work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-up-work). - The
uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) - The
automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage to ensure pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the required CPU and memory resources.[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler)


It's a common practice to enable cluster autoscaler for nodes and either the Vertical Pod Autoscaler or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pods. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, it applies the specified scaling rules when the node pool size is lower than the minimum node count, up to the maximum node count. The cluster autoscaler waits to take effect until a new node is needed in the node pool or until a node might be safely deleted from the current node pool. For more information, see [How does scale down work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-down-work)

## Best practices and considerations

- When implementing
**availability zones with the cluster autoscaler**, we recommend using a single node pool for each zone. You can set the`--balance-similar-node-groups`

parameter to`True`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale up operations. When this approach isn't implemented, scale down operations can disrupt the balance of nodes across zones.

Note

The Cluster Autoscaler is not zone-aware, and zone allocation is handled by the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Sets. The above best practice becomes even more relevant when using zone-based [pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) on a single multi-zonal node pool, as restrictive constraints may leave pods in a pending state, especially in capacity-constrained regions or during zone-down scenarios.

For

**clusters with more than 400 nodes**, we recommend using Azure CNI or Azure CNI Overlay.To

**effectively run workloads concurrently on both Spot and On-demand node pools**, consider using. This approach allows you to scale out nodepools based on assigned priority. The following configuration illustrates this setup.*priority expanders*`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander namespace: kube-system data: priorities: |- 10: - .*spotpool1.* - .*spotpool2.* 50: - .*ondemandpool1.*`

Exercise caution when

**assigning CPU/Memory requests on pods**. The cluster autoscaler scales up based on pending pods rather than CPU/Memory pressure on nodes.For

**clusters concurrently hosting both long-running workloads, like web apps, and short/bursty job workloads**, we recommend separating them into distinct node pools with[Affinity Rules](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)/[expanders](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders).Use

[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)to help prevent unnecessary node drain or scale down operations. Specifying the annotation[cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#cluster-autoscaler-kubernetes-io-safe-to-evict)on the Pod spec will also prevent the pods from being evicted. Use this annotation with caution, as it may cause the Cluster Autoscaler encounter issues when draining a node with a running Pod that includes this annotation.In an autoscaler-enabled node pool, scale down nodes by removing workloads, instead of manually reducing the min/ max count of the node pool. This can be problematic if the node pool is already at maximum capacity or if there are active workloads running on the nodes, potentially causing unexpected behavior by the cluster autoscaler.

Nodes don't scale up if pods have a PriorityClass value below -10. Priority -10 is reserved for

[overprovisioning pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler). For more information, see[Using the cluster autoscaler with Pod Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-cluster-autoscaler-work-with-pod-priority-and-preemption).**Don't combine other node autoscaling mechanisms**, such as Virtual Machine Scale Set autoscalers, with the cluster autoscaler.The cluster autoscaler

**might be unable to scale down if pods can't move, such as in the following situations**:- A directly created pod not backed by a controller object, such as a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
- A pod disruption budget (PDB) that's too restrictive and doesn't allow the number of pods to fall below a certain threshold.
- A pod uses node selectors or anti-affinity that can't be honored if scheduled on a different node.
For more information, see
[What types of pods can prevent the cluster autoscaler from removing a node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node).


Important

**Don't make changes to individual nodes within the autoscaled node pools**. All nodes in the same node group should have uniform capacity, labels, taints and system pods running on them.

- The cluster autoscaler isn't responsible for enforcing a "maximum node count" in a cluster node pool irrespective of pod scheduling considerations. If any non-cluster autoscaler actor sets the node pool count to a number beyond the cluster autoscaler's configured maximum, the cluster autoscaler doesn't automatically remove nodes. The cluster autoscaler scale down behaviors remain scoped to removing underutilized nodes. The sole purpose of the cluster autoscaler's max node count configuration is to enforce an upper limit for scale up operations. It doesn't have any effect on scale down considerations.

## Cluster autoscaler profile

The [cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler-profile-settings) is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler. You can configure the cluster autoscaler profile when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster.

### Optimizing the cluster autoscaler profile

You should fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile settings according to your specific workload scenarios while also considering tradeoffs between performance and cost. This section provides examples that demonstrate those tradeoffs.

It's important to note that the cluster autoscaler profile settings are cluster-wide and applied to all autoscale-enabled node pools. Any scaling actions that take place in one node pool can affect the autoscaling behavior of other node pools, which can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you apply consistent and synchronized profile configurations across all relevant node pools to ensure you get your desired results.

#### Example 1: Optimizing for performance

For clusters that handle substantial and bursty workloads with a primary focus on performance, we recommend increasing the `scan-interval`

and decreasing the `scale-down-utilization-threshold`

. These settings help batch multiple scaling operations into a single call, optimizing scaling time and the utilization of compute read/write quotas. It also helps mitigate the risk of swift scale down operations on underutilized nodes, enhancing the pod scheduling efficiency. Also increase `ok-total-unready-count`

and `max-total-unready-percentage`

.

For clusters with daemonset pods, we recommend setting `ignore-daemonsets-utilization`

to `true`

, which effectively ignores node utilization by daemonset pods and minimizes unnecessary scale down operations. See [profile for bursty workloads](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-bursty-workloads)

#### Example 2: Optimizing for cost

If you want a [cost-optimized profile](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down), we recommend setting the following parameter configurations:

- Reduce
`scale-down-unneeded-time`

, which is the amount of time a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. - Reduce
`scale-down-delay-after-add`

, which is the amount of time to wait after a node is added before considering it for scale down. - Increase
`scale-down-utilization-threshold`

, which is the utilization threshold for removing nodes. - Increase
`max-empty-bulk-delete`

, which is the maximum number of nodes that can be deleted in a single call. - Set
`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

to false. - Increase
`ok-total-unready-count`

and`max-total-unready-percentage`

.

### Node pool in backoff

Node pool in backoff was introduced in version 0.6.2 and causes the cluster autoscaler to back off from scaling a node pool after a failure.

# Use a service principal with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require either a [Microsoft Entra service principal](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or a [managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources. This article describes how to create a Microsoft Entra service principal and use it with your AKS cluster.

Note

For optimal security and ease of use, we recommend using managed identities instead of service principals to authorize access from an AKS cluster to other resources in Azure. A managed identity is a special type of service principal that you can use to get Microsoft Entra credentials without the need to manage and secure credentials. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- If using Azure PowerShell, you need Azure PowerShell version 5.0.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

- You need permissions to register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and to assign the application to a role in your subscription. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you need to ask your Microsoft Entra ID or subscription administrator to assign the necessary permissions or create the service principal for you.

## Considerations when using a service principal

Keep the following considerations in mind when using a Microsoft Entra service principal with AKS:

- The service principal for Kubernetes is a part of the cluster configuration, but don't use this identity to deploy the cluster. Instead,
[create a service principal](#create-a-service-principal)first, then use that service principal to create the AKS cluster. - Every service principal is associated with a Microsoft Entra application. You can associate the service principal for a Kubernetes cluster with any valid Microsoft Entra application name (for example:
`https://www.contoso.org/example`

). The URL for the application doesn't have to be a real endpoint. - When you specify the service principal
**client ID**, use the value of the application ID (`appId`

for Azure CLI or`ApplicationId`

for Azure PowerShell). - On the agent node virtual machines (VMs) in the AKS cluster, the service principal credentials are stored in the
`/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`

file. - When you delete an AKS cluster that you created using the
command or the`az aks create`

cmdlet, the service principal created isn't automatically deleted. See the`New-AzAksCluster`

[steps to delete a service principal](#delete-a-service-principal). - If you're using a service principal from a different Microsoft Entra tenant, there are other considerations around the permissions available when you deploy the cluster. You might not have the appropriate permissions to read and write directory information. For more information, see
[What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

## Create a service principal

Create a service principal using the

command.`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`# Set environment variable SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "name": "http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the values for

`appId`

and`password`

from the output to use when creating the AKS cluster.

Create a service principal using the

command.`New-AzADServicePrincipal`

`# Set environment variable $SpName = <your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $SpName -OutVariable sp`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`Secret : System.Security.SecureString ServicePrincipalNames : {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal} ApplicationId : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : myAKSClusterServicePrincipal Id : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Type :`

The values are stored in a variable that you use when creating the AKS cluster.

Decrypt the value stored in the

**Secret**secure string using the following command.`$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)`


## Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--service-principal`

and`--client-secret`

parameters set to specify the`appId`

and`password`

values.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> APP_ID=<app-id> CLIENT_SECRET=<password-value> # Create the AKS cluster az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --service-principal $APP_ID \ --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Convert the service principal

`ApplicationId`

and`Secret`

to a**PSCredential**object using the following command.`$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($sp.ApplicationId, $sp.Secret)`

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

cmdlet and specify the`New-AzAksCluster`

`ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret`

parameter with the**PSCredential**object as its value.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> # Create the AKS cluster New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ClusterName -ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret $Cred`


Note

If you're using an existing service principal with customized secret, make sure the secret isn't longer than 190 bytes.

## Delegate access to other Azure resources

You can use the service principal for the AKS cluster to access other resources. For example, if you want to deploy your AKS cluster into an existing Azure virtual network (VNet) subnet, connect to ACR, or access keys or secrets in a key vault from your cluster, then you need to delegate access to those resources to the service principal. To delegate access, assign an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role to the service principal.

When you assign roles, you specify the scope for the role assignment, such as a resource group or VNet resource. The role assignment determines what permissions the service principal has on the resource and at what scope.

Important

Permissions granted to a service principal associated with a cluster can take up 60 minutes to propagate.

## Create a role assignment

Note

The scope for a resource needs to be a full resource ID, such as `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup`

or `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupVnet/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet`

.

Create a role assignment using the

command. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`az role assignment create`

`--assignee`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`--scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`az role assignment create \ --assignee <app-id> \ --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User"`


Create a role assignment using the

cmdlet. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`New-AzRoleAssignment`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`-Scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`New-AzRoleAssignment -ApplicationId <app-id> ` -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" ` -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User"`


## Grant access to Azure Container Registry

If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. We recommend following the steps in [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration) to integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal.

## Grant access to networking resources

If you're using advanced networking with a VNet and subnet or public IP addresses in different resource group, you can assign the [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) built-in role on the subnet within the VNet. Alternatively, you can create a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with permissions to access the network resources in that resource group. For more information, see [AKS service permissions](concepts-identity#aks-service-permissions).

## Grant access to storage disks

If you need to access existing disk resources in another resource group, assign one of the following sets of role permissions:

- Create a
[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)and define the*Microsoft.Compute/disks/read*and*Microsoft.Compute/disks/write*role permissions. - Assign the
[Virtual Machine Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor)built-in role on the resource group.

## Grant access to Azure Container Instances

If you use virtual kubelet to integrate with AKS and run Azure Container Instances (ACI) in resource group separate from the AKS cluster, you need to assign *Contributor* permissions to the AKS cluster service principal for the ACI resource group.

## Delete a service principal

Query for the service principal client ID (

`servicePrincipalProfile.clientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecommand with the`az ad sp delete`

`--id`

parameter. The [`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> # Delete the service principal az ad sp delete --id $(az aks show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId \ --output tsv)`


Query for the service principal client ID (

`ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecmdlet with the`Remove-AzADServicePrincipal`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter. The [`Get-AzAksCluster`

][get-azakscluster] cmdlet retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> $ClientId = (Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster ).ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId # Delete the service principal Remove-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $ClientId`


## Resolve service principal credential issues

Azure CLI caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

Azure PowerShell caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

If these credentials expire, you might encounter errors during AKS cluster deployment. If there's an issue with the cached credentials, you might receive an error message similar to the following error message:

```
Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'.
Details: The credentials in ServicePrincipalProfile were invalid. Please see https://aka.ms/aks-sp-help for more details.
Details: adal: Refresh request failed. Status Code = '401'.
```


You can check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command with the

`"[].endDateTime"`

query. The output shows you the `endDateTime`

of your credentials.```
az ad app credential list \
--id <app-id> \
--query "[].endDateTime" \
--output tsv
```


- Check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the
cmdlet. The output shows you the`Get-AzADAppCredential`

`EndDate`

of your credentials.

```
Get-AzADAppCredential -ApplicationId <app-id>
```


**The default expiration time for the service principal credentials is one year**. If your credentials are older than one year, you can [reset the existing credentials](update-credentials#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials) or [create a new service principal](update-credentials#create-a-new-service-principal).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Onboard custom models for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As an AI engineer or developer, you might have to prototype and deploy AI workloads with a range of different model weights. AKS provides the option to deploy inferencing workloads using open-source presets supported out-of-box and managed in the KAITO [model registry](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets) or to dynamically download from the [HuggingFace registry](https://huggingface.co/models) at runtime onto your AKS cluster.

In this article, you learn how to onboard a sample HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on without having to manage custom images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an account, you can

[create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).An AKS cluster with the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled. For more information, see

[Enable KAITO on an AKS cluster](ai-toolchain-operator#enable-the-ai-toolchain-operator-add-on-on-an-aks-cluster).This example deployment requires quota for the

`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

virtual machine (VM) family in your Azure subscription. If you don't have quota for this VM family, please[request a quota increase](/en-us/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal).Note

Currently, only the HuggingFace runtime supports inference with the KAITO custom model deployment template.


## Choose an open-source language model from HuggingFace

In this example, we use the [BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7) small language model. Alternatively, you can choose from thousands of text-generation models supported on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>`

Clone the KAITO project GitHub repository using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito.git`


## Deploy your model inferencing workload using the KAITO workspace template

Navigate to the

`kaito`

directory and copy the[sample deployment YAML](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/examples/custom-model-integration/custom-model-deployment.yaml)manifest. Replace the default values in the following fields with your model's requirements. For this example, we specify the**bloom-1b7**HuggingFace model ID for[BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7)model:`instanceType`

: The minimum VM size for this inference service deployment is`Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4`

. For larger model sizes you can choose a VM in thefamily with higher memory capacity.`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

`MODEL_ID`

: Replace with your model's specific HuggingFace identifier, which can be found after`https://huggingface.co/`

in the model card URL.`"--torch_dtype"`

: Set to`"float16"`

for compatibility with V100 GPUs. For A100, H100 or newer GPUs, use`"bfloat16"`

.- (Optional)
`HF_TOKEN`

: Specify the values in this section only if you are deploying a private or gated Hugging Face model for inference.

Save these changes to your

`custom-model-deployment.yaml`

file.Run the deployment in your AKS cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f custom-model-deployment.yaml`


## Test your custom model inferencing service

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace using the

`kubectl get workspace`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace-custom-llm -w`

Note

Note that machine readiness can take

*up to 10 minutes*, and workspace readiness*up to 20 minutes*.Check your language model inference service and get the service IP address using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-custom-llm -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')`

Test your custom model inference service with a sample input of your choice using the

[OpenAI API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat):`kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never curl --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -X POST http://$SERVICE_IP/v1/completions \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "bloom-1b7", "prompt": "What sport should I play in rainy weather?", "max_tokens": 20 }'`


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring extra Azure compute charges.

Delete the KAITO inference workspace using the `kubectl delete workspace`

command.

```
kubectl delete workspace workspace-custom-llm
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to onboard a HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on directly to your AKS cluster. To learn more about AI and machine learning on AKS, see the following articles:

# Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to resize an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It's important to right-size your clusters to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

## Cluster right-sizing

When you create an AKS cluster, you specify the number of nodes and the size of the nodes, which determines the compute capacity of the cluster. Oversized clusters can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersized clusters can lead to performance issues. You can adjust the number and size of the nodes in the cluster to right-size the cluster to meet the needs of your applications.

Consider the following factors when right-sizing your cluster:

**Resource requirements**: Understand the resource requirements of your applications to determine the number of nodes and the size of the nodes needed to run your workloads.**Performance requirements**: Determine the performance requirements of your applications to ensure that the cluster can meet the demands of your workloads.**Cost considerations**: Optimize costs by right-sizing your cluster to avoid unnecessary costs associated with oversized clusters.**Application demands**: Monitor the demands of your applications to adjust the size of the cluster in response to changing demands.**Infrastructure constraints**: Consider the infrastructure constraints of your environment, such as capacity or reserved instance limiting to specific SKUs, to ensure that the cluster can be right-sized within the limits of your environment.

## Monitor cluster performance and cost

Closely monitor the performance and cost of your clusters to ensure they're right-sized to meet the needs of your application and make adjustments as needed. You can use the following resources for monitoring:

[Identify high CPU usage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-high-cpu-consuming-containers-aks)[Troubleshoot memory saturation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-memory-saturation-aks)[Cost analysis add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cost-analysis)[Configure the Metrics Server Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)

## When to resize a cluster

You might want to resize a cluster in scenarios such as the following:

- If you see that CPU and memory usage is consistently low, consider
*downsizing*the cluster. If usage is consistently high, make sure you have[autoscaling enabled](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster)and increase the maximum node count if necessary. - The
[cost analysis add-on for AKS](cost-analysis)shows you details about node usage and cost that indicate you might benefit from cluster resizing. For example, if you see that your nodes have a*high idle cost*with a*low usage cost*, you might consider resizing your cluster to reduce costs. - The
[Metrics Server VPA](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)shows you that your requests and/or limits are too high or low based on historical usage. You can use this information to adjust your cluster size to better match your workload. - You experience performance issues such as resource starvation. This might be a result of the cluster being undersized for the demands of your applications.

## What happens when I resize a cluster?

### Increasing cluster size

You can increase the size of an AKS cluster by adding nodes to the cluster. You can [add nodes to the cluster manually](scale-cluster) or [configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster) in response to changing demands.

When you increase the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- New node instances are created using the same configuration as the existing nodes in the cluster.
- New pods might be scheduled on the new nodes to distribute the workload across the cluster.
- Existing pods don't move to the new nodes unless they are rescheduled due to node failures or other reasons.

### Decreasing cluster size

You can decrease the size of an AKS cluster by removing nodes from the cluster. When you remove nodes from the cluster, the nodes are automatically drained and removed from the cluster. You can remove nodes from the cluster manually or configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

When you decrease the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- AKS gracefully terminates the nodes and drains the pods running on the nodes before removing the nodes from the cluster.
- Any pods managed by a replication controller are rescheduled on other node instances in the cluster.
- Any pods that aren't managed by a replication controller aren't restarted.

## Manually resize an AKS cluster

- Resize an AKS cluster using the
command with the`az aks scale`

`--node-count`

and`--nodepool-name`

parameters.

Before running the resize command, set the required environment variables with your own values. The example values should be substituted with your actual resource group, cluster, desired node count, and node pool name.

```
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count $NUM_NODES --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL_NAME
```


Results:

```
{
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 4,
"maxCount": null,
"minCount": null,
"name": "nodepool1",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "xxxxx",
"fqdn": "xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
...
}
```


Repeat this command for each node pool in the cluster that you want to resize. If your cluster has only one node pool, you can omit the `--nodepool-name`

parameter.

## Automatically resize an AKS cluster

Use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) to automatically resize your node pools in response to changing demands.

For more information, see the [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview). To configure cluster autoscaling in AKS, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables for your resource group, cluster name, and location:

```
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group-name>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<your-cluster-name>"
export LOCATION="<your-azure-region>"
```


## Limitations

- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not yet available for Windows node pool.
- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not supported for AKS automatic because of
[node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown)preventing role assignments.

## Configure SSH access

To improve security and support your corporate security requirements or strategy, AKS supports disabling SSH both on the cluster and at the node pool level. Disable SSH introduces a simplified approach compared to configuring [network security group rules](concepts-security#azure-network-security-groups) on the AKS subnet/node network interface card (NIC). Disable SSH only supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools.

When you disable SSH at cluster creation time, it takes effect after the cluster is created. However, when you disable SSH on an existing cluster or node pool, AKS doesn't automatically disable SSH. At any time, you can choose to perform a nodepool upgrade operation. The disable/enable SSH operation takes effect after the node image update is complete.

Note

When you disable SSH at the cluster level, it applies to all existing node pools. Any node pools created after this operation will have SSH enabled by default, and you'll need to run these commands again in order to disable it.

Note

[kubectl debug node](node-access) continues to work after you disable SSH because it doesn't depend on the SSH service.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Disable SSH on a new cluster deployment

By default, the SSH service on AKS cluster nodes is open to all users and pods running on the cluster. You can prevent direct SSH access from any network to cluster nodes to help limit the attack vector if a container in a pod becomes compromised.

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a new cluster, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on all the node pools during cluster creation.Important

After you disable the SSH service, you can't SSH into the cluster to perform administrative tasks or to troubleshoot.

Note

On a newly created cluster, disable SSH will only configure the first system node pool. All other node pools need to be configured at the node pool level.

```
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command to add a node pool, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To disable SSH on an existing cluster, you need to disable SSH for each node pool on this cluster.

### Re-enable SSH access

To re-enable SSH access on a node pool, update the node pool with either `--ssh-access localuser`

(for traditional SSH key-based access) or `--ssh-access entraid`

(for Entra ID based access). See the respective sections for detailed instructions.

You can configure your AKS cluster to use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for SSH authentication to cluster nodes. This eliminates the need to manage SSH keys and allows you to use your Entra ID credentials to access nodes securely.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH on a new cluster

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH authentication during cluster creation.```
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for an existing node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing cluster, you need to enable it for each node pool individually.

Local user SSH access uses traditional SSH key-based authentication. This is the default SSH access method for AKS clusters.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Create an AKS cluster with SSH keys

Use the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to deploy an AKS cluster with an SSH public key. You can either specify the key or a key file using the `--ssh-key-value`

argument, or use `--ssh-access localuser`

to explicitly set local user SSH access.

| SSH parameter | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`--generate-ssh-key` |
If you don't have your own SSH keys, specify `--generate-ssh-key` . The Azure CLI automatically generates a set of SSH keys and saves them in the default directory `~/.ssh/` . |
|
`--ssh-key-value` |
Public key path or key contents to install on node VMs for SSH access. For example, `ssh-rsa AAAAB...snip...UcyupgH azureuser@linuxvm` . |
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
`--ssh-access localuser` |
Explicitly enable local user SSH access with key-based authentication. | |
`--no-ssh-key` |
If you don't require SSH keys, specify this argument. However, AKS automatically generates a set of SSH keys because the Azure Virtual Machine resource dependency doesn't support an empty SSH keys file. As a result, the keys aren't returned and can't be used to SSH into the node VMs. The private key is discarded and not saved. |

Note

If no parameters are specified, the Azure CLI defaults to referencing the SSH keys stored in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

file. If the keys aren't found, the command returns the message `An RSA key file or key value must be supplied to SSH Key Value`

.

**Examples:**

To create a cluster and use the default generated SSH keys:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --generate-ssh-key`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

To explicitly enable local user SSH access:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-access localuser --generate-ssh-key`


### Enable local user SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


### Enable local user SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


Important

For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


### Update SSH public key on an existing AKS cluster

Use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command to update the SSH public key (preview) on your cluster. This operation updates the key on all node pools. You can either specify a key or a key file using the

`--ssh-key-value`

argument.Note

Updating the SSH keys is supported on Azure virtual machine scale sets with AKS clusters.

**Examples:**

To specify a new SSH public key value:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza-xxx'`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`


Important

After you update the SSH key, AKS doesn't automatically update your node pool. At any time, you can choose to perform a [nodepool upgrade operation](node-image-upgrade). The update SSH keys operation takes effect after a node image update is complete. For clusters with [Node Auto-provisioning](node-autoprovision) enabled, a node image update can be performed by applying a new label to the Kubernetes NodePool custom resource.

## Verify SSH service status

After disabling SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is inactive on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is disabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:36:53 UTC; 25min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: inactive (dead)`

, which confirms SSH is disabled on the node.

After enabling Entra ID based SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active and configured for Entra ID authentication on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

After configuring local user SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

# Tutorial - Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this tutorial, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker`

commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) system.

Note

Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Use

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)to clone the sample application to your development environment.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git`

Change into the cloned directory.

`cd aks-store-demo`


## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [ docker-compose-quickstart YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the

[repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main)you cloned.

## Create container images and run application

You can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the

`docker compose`

command:`docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d`

View the created images using the

command.`docker images`

`docker images`

The following condensed example output shows the created images:

`REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID aks-store-demo-product-service latest 72f5cd7e6b84 aks-store-demo-order-service latest 54ad5de546f9 aks-store-demo-store-front latest 1125f85632ae ...`

View the running containers using the

command.`docker ps`

`docker ps`

The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

`CONTAINER ID IMAGE f27fe74cfd0a aks-store-demo-product-service df1eaa137885 aks-store-demo-order-service b3ce9e496e96 aks-store-demo-store-front 31df28627ffa rabbitmq:3.13.2-management-alpine`


## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. * Do not delete the container images* - you use them in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

command.`docker-compose down`

`docker compose down`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample application, created container images for the application, and then tested the application. You learned how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.

# Use Arm-based processor (Arm64) Virtual Machines (VMs) in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster for cost effectiveness

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Arm-based processors (Arm64)](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/cobalt-overview) are power-efficient and cost-effective, but don't compromise on performance. These Arm64 VMs are engineered to efficiently run dynamic, scalable workloads and can deliver up to 50% better price-performance than comparable x86-based VMs for scale-out workloads.

Because of their ability to scale workloads efficiently, Arm64 VMs are well-suited for web or application servers, open-source databases, cloud-native applications, gaming servers, and other high traffic applications.

Note

While a combination of CPU, memory, and networking capacity configurations heavily influences the cost effectiveness of a SKU, Arm64 VM types are recommended for cost optimization.

In this article, you'll learn how to add a Arm64 VM to an existing node pool.

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Limitations

- Arm64 VMs aren't supported for Windows node pools.
- Existing node pools can't be updated to use an Arm64 VM.
- Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS)-enabled node pools are only supported with Arm64 SKUs when using Azure Linux 3.0+.
- Arm64 node pools aren't supported on Defender-enabled clusters with Kubernetes version 1.29.0 or lower.

## Create node pools with Arm64 VMs

The Arm64 processor provides low power compute for your Kubernetes workloads. Arm64 virtual machines can be added to existing clusters even mixing Intel and Arm architecture node pools within a cluster. To create an Arm64 node pool, you need to choose a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series), [Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or [Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series) series virtual machine.

### Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

Use [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) to add a node pool with an Arm64 VM to an existing cluster. Alternatively, if you're using

[Azure Linux 3.0+](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/how-to-enable-azure-linux-3), you can add a node pool with an Arm64 VM and

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled.

Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

Add a FIPS-enabled node pool with an Arm64 VM

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use the

with`az aks nodepool add`

`--enable-fips-image`

and`--os-sku`

parameters.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --os-sku AzureLinux --enable-fips-image --kubernetes-version 1.31 --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see

[Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
Update a node pool with an Arm64 VM to enable FIPS

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter to enable FIPS on an existing node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see [Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).

## Verify the node pool uses Arm64

Verify a node pool uses Arm64 using the [ az aks nodepool show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command and verify the

`vmSize`

is a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series),

[Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or

[Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series)series.

```
az aks nodepool show \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name mynodepool \
--query vmSize
```


The following example output shows the node pool uses Arm64:

```
"Standard_D2pds_v5"
```

# Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with API Server VNet Integration

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configured with API Server VNet Integration projects the API server endpoint directly into a delegated subnet in the VNet where AKS is deployed. API Server VNet Integration enables network communication between the API server and the cluster nodes without requiring a private link or tunnel. The API server is available behind an internal load balancer VIP in the delegated subnet, which the nodes are configured to utilize. By using API Server VNet Integration, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only.

## API server connectivity

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure subscription. Your cluster or node pool is in your Azure subscription. The server and the virtual machines that make up the cluster nodes can communicate with each other through the API server VIP and pod IPs that are projected into the delegated subnet.

API Server VNet Integration is supported for public or private clusters. You can add or remove public access after cluster provisioning. Unlike non-VNet integrated clusters, the agent nodes always communicate directly with the private IP address of the API server internal load balancer (ILB) IP without using DNS. All node to API server traffic is kept on private networking, and no tunnel is required for API server to node connectivity. Out-of-cluster clients needing to communicate with the API server can do so normally if public network access is enabled. If public network access is disabled, you should follow the same private DNS setup methodology as standard [private clusters](private-clusters).

## Prerequisites

- You must have Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed. You can check your version using the
`az --version`

command.

## Limitations

- API Server VNet Integration does not support
[Virtual Network Encryption](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview). Clusters deployed on**v3 or earlier AKS node SKUs**(which do not support VNet Encryption) are allowed but traffic will not be encrypted. Clusters deployed on**v4 or later AKS node SKUs**(which support VNet Encryption) are blocked because encrypted VNets are incompatible with API Server VNet Integration. See[AKS supported VM SKUs](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes)for details.

## Availability

- API Server VNet Integration is available in all GA public cloud regions except qatarcentral.

## Create an AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using managed VNet

You can configure your AKS clusters with API Server VNet Integration in managed VNet or bring-your-own VNet mode. You can create them as public clusters (with API server access available via a public IP) or private clusters (where the API server is only accessible via private VNet connectivity). You can also toggle between a public and private state without redeploying your cluster.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location westus2 --name <resource-group>`


### Deploy a public cluster

Deploy a public AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration for managed VNet using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Deploy a private cluster

Deploy a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration for managed VNet using the

command with the`az aks create`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using bring-your-own VNet

When using bring-your-own VNet, you must create and delegate an API server subnet to `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same virtual network. The minimum supported API server subnet size is a */28*.

The cluster identity needs permissions to both the API server subnet and the node subnet. Lack of permissions at the API server subnet can cause a provisioning failure.

Warning

An AKS cluster reserves at least 9 IPs in the subnet address space. Running out of IP addresses may prevent API server scaling and cause an API server outage.

### Create a resource group

- Create a resource group using the
command.`az group create`


```
az group create --location <location> --name <resource-group>
```


### Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`az network vnet create --name <vnet-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/16`

Create an API server subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <apiserver-subnet-name> \ --delegations Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/28`

Create a cluster subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <cluster-subnet-name> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.1.0/24`


### Create a managed identity and give it permissions on the virtual network

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <managed-identity-name> --location <location>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the API server subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the cluster subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`


### Deploy a public cluster

Deploy a public AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --vnet-subnet-id <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --assign-identity <managed-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Deploy a private cluster

Deploy a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --vnet-subnet-id <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --assign-identity <managed-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Convert an existing AKS cluster to API Server VNet Integration

Warning

**API Server VNet Integration is a one-way, capacity-sensitive feature.**

**Manual restart required.**

After enabling API Server VNet Integration using`az aks update --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

, due to control plane resource transition, you must immediately restart the cluster for the change to take effect. This restart is not automated. Delaying the restart increases the risk of capacity becoming unavailable, which can prevent the API server from starting. The cluster restart also ensures that all nodes reliably reconnect to the new API server endpoint.**Capacity is validated, but not reserved.**

AKS validates regional capacity when you enable the feature on an existing cluster, but this validation does not reserve capacity. If the restart is delayed and capacity becomes unavailable in the meantime, the cluster may fail to start after a stop or restart. Clusters that enabled this feature before general availability (GA), or that have not yet restarted since enablement, will not undergo capacity validation.**Feature cannot be disabled.**

Once enabled, the feature is permanent. You cannot disable API Server VNet Integration.

This upgrade performs a node-image version upgrade on all node pools and restarts all workloads while they undergo a rolling image upgrade.

Warning

Converting a cluster to API Server VNet Integration results in a change of the API Server IP address, though the hostname remains the same. If the IP address of the API server has been configured in any firewalls or network security group rules, those rules may need to be updated.

Update your cluster to API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


## Enable or disable private cluster mode on an existing cluster with API Server VNet Integration

AKS clusters configured with API Server VNet Integration can have public network access/private cluster mode enabled or disabled without redeploying the cluster. The API server hostname doesn't change, but public DNS entries are modified or removed if necessary.

Note

`--disable-private-cluster`

is currently in preview. For more information, see [Reference and support levels](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-types-and-status).

### Enable private cluster mode

Enable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


### Disable private cluster mode

Disable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --disable-private-cluster`


## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name>`


## Expose the API server through Private Link

You can expose the API server endpoint of a private cluster with API Server VNet Integration using Azure Private Link. The following steps show how to create a Private Link Service (PLS) in the cluster VNet and connect to it from another VNet or subscription using a Private Endpoint.

### Create an API Server VNet Integration Private cluster

Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`


For more guidance on how to set up Private Link with API Server VNet Integration, see [Private Link with API Server VNet Integration](private-apiserver-vnet-integration-cluster).

## NSG security rules

All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. But if you have added NSG rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, ensure that the NSG security rules permit the following types of communication:

| Destination | Source | Protocol | Port | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Cluster Subnet | TCP | 443 and 4443 | Required to enable communication between Nodes and the API server. |
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Azure Load Balancer | TCP | 9988 | Required to enable communication between Azure Load Balancer and the API server. You can also enable all communications between the Azure Load Balancer and the API Server Subnet CIDR. |

# AKS frequently asked questions

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Support

### Does AKS offer a service-level agreement?

AKS provides service-level agreement (SLA) guarantees in the [Standard pricing tier with the Uptime SLA feature](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

### What is platform support, and what does it include?

Platform support is a reduced support plan for unsupported n-3 version clusters. Platform support includes only Azure infrastructure support.

For more information, see the [platform support policy](supported-kubernetes-versions).

### Does AKS automatically upgrade my unsupported clusters?

Yes, AKS initiates auto-upgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where *n* is the latest supported AKS minor version that's generally available) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support policy.

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions](supported-kubernetes-versions), [Planned maintenance windows](planned-maintenance), and [Automatic upgrades](auto-upgrade-cluster).

### Can I apply Azure reservation discounts to my AKS agent nodes?

AKS agent nodes are billed as standard Azure virtual machines (VMs). If you purchased [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) for the VM size that you're using in AKS, those discounts are automatically applied.

## Operations

### Can I run Windows Server containers on AKS?

Yes, AKS supports Windows Server containers. For more information, see the [Windows Server on AKS FAQ](windows-faq).

### What Linux operating systems (OS) are supported on AKS?

AKS supports four main Linux operating systems, including Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), [Azure Linux OS Guard](use-azure-linux-os-guard), and [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks). When specifying `--os-type Linux`

during node pool creation or cluster creation, the default OS is Ubuntu Linux.

### What operating systems (OS) versions are supported on AKS?

When using `--os-sku Ubuntu`

, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 22.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.25-1.34. AKS defaults to Ubuntu 24.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.35+.
When using `--os-sku AzureLinux`

, AKS defaults to Azure Linux 3.0 in Kubernetes versions 1.32+.
In some scenarios, like FIPS-enabled node pools, the default OS version might differ. See [node images](node-images) for more information.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between Azure tenants?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between tenants is currently unsupported.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between subscriptions?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between subscriptions is currently unsupported.

### Can I move my AKS cluster or AKS infrastructure resources to other resource groups or rename them?

No. Moving or renaming your AKS cluster and its associated resources isn't supported.

### Can I restore my cluster after I delete it?

No. You can't restore your cluster after you delete it. When you delete your cluster, the node resource group and all its resources are also deleted.

If you want to keep any of your resources, move them to another resource group before you delete your cluster. If you want to protect against accidental deletes, you can lock the AKS managed resource group that's hosting your cluster resources by using [Node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown).

### Can I scale my AKS cluster to zero?

You can completely [stop a running AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster) or [scale or autoscale all or specific User node pools](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0) to zero.

You can't directly scale [system node pools](use-system-pools) to zero.

### Can I use the virtual machine scale set APIs to scale manually?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS APIs (`az aks scale`

).

### Can I use virtual machine scale sets to manually scale to zero nodes?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS API to scale nonsystem node pools to zero or [stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Can I stop or deallocate all my VMs?

No. This configuration isn't supported. [Stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Why are two resource groups created with AKS?

AKS builds upon many Azure infrastructure resources, including virtual machine scale sets, virtual networks, and managed disks. These integrations enable you to apply many of the core capabilities of the Azure platform within the managed Kubernetes environment provided by AKS. For example, you can use most Azure VM types directly with AKS, and you can use Azure Reservations to receive discounts on those resources automatically.

To enable this architecture, each AKS deployment spans two resource groups:

- You create the first resource group. This group contains only the Kubernetes service resource. The AKS resource provider automatically creates the second resource group during deployment. An example of the second resource group is
*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. For information on how to specify the name of this second resource group, see the next section. - The second resource group, known as the
*node resource group*, contains all of the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster. These resources include the Kubernetes node VMs, virtual networking, and storage. By default, the node resource group has a name like*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. AKS automatically deletes the node resource group whenever you delete the cluster. Use this resource group only for resources that share the cluster's lifecycle.

Note

Modifying any resource under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action and will cause cluster operation failures. You can prevent changes from being made to the node resource group. [Block users from modifying resources](node-resource-group-lockdown) that the AKS cluster manages.

### Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?

By default, AKS names the node resource group *MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location*, but you can provide your own name.

To specify your own resource group name, install the [aks-preview](/en-us/cli/azure/aks) Azure CLI extension version *0.3.2* or later. When you create an AKS cluster by using the `az aks create`

command, use the `--node-resource-group`

parameter and specify a name for the resource group. If you use an [Azure Resource Manager template](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/2022-09-01/managedclusters) to deploy an AKS cluster, you can define the resource group name by using the `nodeResourceGroup`

property.

- The Azure resource provider automatically creates the secondary resource group.
- You can specify a custom resource group name only when you create the cluster.

As you work with the node resource group, you can't:

- Specify an existing resource group for the node resource group.
- Specify a different subscription for the node resource group.
- Change the node resource group name after you create the cluster.
- Specify names for the managed resources within the node resource group.
- Modify or delete Azure-created tags of managed resources within the node resource group.

### Can I modify tags and other properties of the AKS resources in the node resource group?

You might get unexpected scaling and upgrading errors if you modify or delete Azure-created tags and other resource properties in the node resource group. AKS allows you to create and modify custom tags created by end users, and you can add those tags when you [create a node pool](manage-node-pools#specify-a-taint-label-or-tag-for-a-node-pool). You might want to create or modify custom tags, for example, to assign a business unit or cost center. Another option is to apply policies and modify tags through the AKS resource itself—specifically via the cluster and node pools..

Azure-created tags are created for their respective Azure services, and you should always allow them. For AKS, there are the `aks-managed`

and `k8s-azure`

tags. Modifying any *Azure-created tags* on resources under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action, which breaks the service-level objective (SLO).

Note

In the past, the tag name `Owner`

was reserved for AKS to manage the public IP that's assigned on the front-end IP of the load balancer. Now, services use the `aks-managed`

prefix. For legacy resources, don't use Azure policies to apply the `Owner`

tag name. Otherwise, all resources on your AKS cluster deployment and update operations will break. This restriction doesn't apply to newly created resources.

### Why do I see aks-managed prefixed Helm releases on my cluster, and why does their revision count keep increasing?

AKS uses Helm to deliver components to your cluster. You can safely ignore `aks-managed`

prefixed Helm releases. Continuously increasing revisions on these Helm releases are expected and safe.

## Quotas, limits, and region availability

### Which Azure regions currently provide AKS?

For a complete list of available regions, see [AKS regions and availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across regions?

No. AKS clusters are regional resources and can't span regions. For guidance on how to create an architecture that includes multiple regions, see [best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery](operator-best-practices-multi-region#plan-for-multiregion-deployment).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across availability zones?

Yes, you can deploy an AKS cluster across one or more [availability zones](availability-zones) in [regions that support them](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

### Can I have different VM sizes in a single cluster?

Yes, you can use different VM sizes in your AKS cluster by creating [multiple node pools](create-node-pools).

### What's the size limit on a container image in AKS?

AKS doesn't set a limit on the container image size. But the larger the image, the higher the memory demand. A larger size could potentially exceed resource limits or the overall available memory of worker nodes. By default, memory for VM size Standard_DS2_v2 for an AKS cluster is set to 7 GiB.

When a container image is excessively large, as in the terabyte (TB) range, the kubelet might not be able to pull it from your container registry to a node because of the lack of disk space.

For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update doesn't automatically run and apply the latest updates. You should perform an upgrade on the cluster and the Windows Server node pools in your AKS cluster. Follow a regular schedule based on the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, and then removes the older nodes. For more information on this process, see [Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

### Are AKS images required to run as root?

The following images have functional requirements to run as root, and exceptions must be filed for any policies:

*mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/coredns**mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/calico/node**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes-csi/azuredisk-csi*

## Security, access, and identity

### Can I limit who has access to the Kubernetes API server?

Yes, there are two options for limiting access to the API server:

- Use
[API server authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges)if you want to maintain a public endpoint for the API server but restrict access to a set of trusted IP ranges. - Use a
[private cluster](private-clusters)if you want to limit the API server to be accessible*only*from within your virtual network.

### Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes?

AKS patches CVEs that have a *vendor fix* every week. CVEs without a fix are waiting on a vendor fix before they can be remediated. The AKS images are automatically updated within 30 days. We recommend that you apply an updated node image on a regular cadence to ensure that the latest patched images and OS patches are all applied and current. You can do this task:

- Manually, through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
- By upgrading your AKS cluster. The cluster upgrades
[cordon and drain nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)automatically. Then it brings a new node online with the latest Ubuntu image and a new patch version or a minor Kubernetes version. For more information, see[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster). - By using a
[node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade).

### Are there security threats that target AKS that I should be aware of?

Microsoft provides guidance for other actions that you can take to secure your workloads through services like [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks). For information on a security threat related to AKS and Kubernetes, see [New large-scale campaign targets Kubeflow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/new-large-scale-campaign-targets-kubeflow/ba-p/2425750) (June 8, 2021).

### Does AKS store any customer data outside the cluster's region?

No. All data is stored in the cluster's region.

### How can I avoid permission ownership setting slow issues when the volume has numerous files?

Traditionally, if your pod is running as a nonroot user (which it should), you must specify an `fsGroup`

parameter inside the pod's security context so that the volume is readable and writable by the pod. For more information on this requirement, see [Configure a security context for a pod or container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

A side effect of setting `fsGroup`

is that each time a volume is mounted, Kubernetes must use the `chown()`

and `chmod()`

commands recursively for all the files and directories inside the volume (with a few exceptions). This scenario happens even if group ownership of the volume already matches the requested `fsGroup`

parameter. This configuration might be expensive for larger volumes with lots of small files, which can cause pod startup to take a long time. This scenario was a known problem before v1.20. The workaround is to set the pod to run as root:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: security-context-demo
spec:
securityContext:
runAsUser: 0
fsGroup: 0
```


The issue was resolved with Kubernetes version 1.20. For more information, see [Kubernetes 1.20: Granular control of volume permission changes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/14/kubernetes-release-1.20-fsgroupchangepolicy-fsgrouppolicy/).

## Networking

### How does the managed control plane communicate with my nodes?

AKS uses a secure tunnel communication to allow the `api-server`

and individual node kubelets to communicate, even on separate virtual networks. The tunnel is secured through mutual Transport Layer Security encryption. The current main tunnel that AKS uses is [Konnectivity, previously known as apiserver-network-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/). Verify that all network rules follow the [Azure required network rules and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)](limit-egress-traffic).

### Can my pods use the API server FQDN instead of the cluster IP?

Yes, you can add the annotation `kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

to pods to set the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`

variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This modification is useful in cases where your cluster egress is done via a layer 7 firewall. An example is when you use Azure Firewall with application rules.

### Can I configure NSGs with AKS?

AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. AKS modifies only the network interface NSG settings. If you're using Container Network Interface (CNI), you also must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod classless interdomain routing (CIDR) ranges. If you're using kubenet, you must also ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod CIDR. For more information, see [Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

### How does time synchronization work in AKS?

AKS nodes run the chrony service, which pulls time from the local host. Containers that run on pods get the time from the AKS nodes. Applications that open inside a container use time from the container of the pod.

## Add-ons, extensions, and integrations

### Can I use custom VM extensions?

No. AKS is a managed service. Manipulation of the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources isn't supported. To install custom components, use the Kubernetes APIs and mechanisms. For example, use DaemonSets to install any required components.

### What Kubernetes admission controllers does AKS support? Can admission controllers be added or removed?

AKS supports the following [admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/):

`NamespaceLifecycle`

`LimitRanger`

`ServiceAccount`

`DefaultIngressClass`

`DefaultStorageClass`

`DefaultTolerationSeconds`

`MutatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ResourceQuota`

`PodNodeSelector`

`PodTolerationRestriction`

`ExtendedResourceToleration`


Currently, you can't modify the list of admission controllers in AKS.

### Can I use admission controller webhooks on AKS?

Yes, you can use admission controller webhooks on AKS. We recommend that you exclude internal AKS namespaces, which are marked with the `control-plane`

label. For example:

```
namespaceSelector:
matchExpressions:
- key: control-plane
operator: DoesNotExist
```


AKS firewalls the API server egress so that your admission controller webhooks need to be accessible from within the cluster.

### Can admission controller webhooks affect kube-system and internal AKS namespaces?

To protect the stability of the system and prevent custom admission controllers from affecting internal services in the `kube-system`

namespace, AKS has an admissions enforcer, which automatically excludes `kube-system`

and AKS internal namespaces. This service ensures that the custom admission controllers don't affect the services that run in `kube-system`

.

If you have a critical use case for deploying something on `kube-system`

(not recommended) in support of your custom admission webhook, you can add the following label or annotation so that the admissions enforcer ignores it:

- Label:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": "true"`

- Annotation:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": true`


### Is Azure Key Vault integrated with AKS?

[Azure Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver](csi-secrets-store-driver) provides native integration of Azure Key Vault into AKS.

### Can I use FIPS cryptographic libraries with deployments on AKS?

Nodes that are enabled with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are now supported on Linux-based node pools. For more information, see [Add a FIPS-enabled node pool](enable-fips-nodes).

### How are AKS add-ons updated?

Any patch, including a security patch, is automatically applied to the AKS cluster. Anything bigger than a patch, like major or minor version changes (which can have breaking changes to your deployed objects), are updated when you update your cluster if a new release is available. For information on when a new release is available, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

### What is the purpose of the AKS Linux extension that I see installed on my Linux virtual machine scale sets instances?

The AKS Linux extension is an Azure VM extension that installs and configures monitoring tools on Kubernetes worker nodes. The extension is installed on all new and existing Linux nodes. It configures the following monitoring tools:

[Node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): Collects hardware telemetry from the VM and makes it available by using a metrics endpoint. Then, a monitoring tool, such as Prometheus, can scrap these metrics.[Node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector): Aims to make various node problems visible to upstream layers in the cluster management stack. It's a systemd unit that runs on each node, detects node problems, and reports them to the cluster's API server by using`Events`

and`NodeConditions`

.[ig](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2260320): Is an eBPF-powered open-source framework for debugging and observing Linux and Kubernetes systems. It provides a set of tools (or gadgets) that gather relevant information that users can use to identify the cause of performance issues, crashes, or other anomalies. Notably, its independence from Kubernetes enables users to employ it also for debugging control plane issues.

These tools help provide observability around many node health-related problems, such as:

**Infrastructure daemon issues:**NTP service down**Hardware issues:**Bad CPU, memory, or disk**Kernel issues:**Kernel deadlock, corrupted file system**Container runtime issues:**Unresponsive runtime daemon

The extension *doesn't require extra outbound access* to any URLs, IP addresses, or ports beyond the [documented AKS egress requirements](limit-egress-traffic). It doesn't require any special permissions granted in Azure. It uses `kubeconfig`

to connect to the API server to send the monitoring data that's collected.

## Troubleshoot cluster issues

### Why is it taking so long to delete my cluster?

Most clusters are deleted upon user request. In some cases, especially cases where you bring your own resource group or perform cross-resource group tasks, deletion can take more time or even fail. If you have an issue with deletions, double-check that you don't have locks on the resource group. Also make sure that any resources outside the resource group are disassociated from the resource group.

### Why is it taking so long to create or update my cluster?

If you have issues with creating and updating clusters, make sure that you don't have any assigned policies or service constraints that might block your AKS cluster from managing resources like VMs, load balancers, or tags.

### If I have pods or deployments in NodeLost or Unknown states, can I still upgrade my cluster?

You can, but we don't recommend it. Perform updates when the state of the cluster is known and healthy.

### If I have a cluster with one or more nodes in an Unhealthy state, or if it's shut down, can I perform an upgrade?

No. Delete or remove any nodes that are in a failed state or otherwise from the cluster before you upgrade.

### I tried to delete my cluster, but I see the error "[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed."

Most commonly, this error arises if you have one or more NSGs in use that are still associated with the cluster. Remove them and attempt to delete the cluster again.

### I ran an upgrade, but now my pods are in crash loops and readiness probes fail.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

### My cluster was working, but suddenly I can't provision load balancers or mount persistent volume claims.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

## Retirements and deprecations

### Which Linux OS versions are deprecated on AKS?

Starting on March 17, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=485795). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

### Which Windows OS versions are deprecated on AKS?

Starting on March 01, 2026, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2019 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.33+ can't use Windows Server 2019. Starting on April 01, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=aks-will-stop-support-for-windows-server-2019-on-march-1-2026). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
Starting on March 15, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2022 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.36+ can't use Windows Server 2022. Starting on April 01, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=ws2022-retirement-aks).

# Autoscaling CoreDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to configure and customize CoreDNS autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## Configure CoreDNS horizontal pod scaling

Due to the elastic nature of AKS, it's common to experience sudden spikes in DNS traffic within your clusters. These spikes can lead to an increase in memory consumption by CoreDNS pods. In some cases, this increased memory consumption can cause `Out of memory`

issues.

To preempt this issue, AKS clusters autoscale CoreDNS pods to reduce memory usage per pod. The default settings for this autoscaling logic are stored in the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. However, you might observe that the default autoscaling of CoreDNS pods isn't always aggressive enough to prevent `Out of memory`

issues for your CoreDNS pods. In this case, you can directly modify the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. Keep in mind that simply increasing the number of CoreDNS pods without addressing the root cause of the `Out of memory`

issue might only provide a temporary fix. If there's not enough memory available across the nodes where the CoreDNS pods are running, increasing the number of CoreDNS pods won't help. You might need to investigate further and implement appropriate solutions such as optimizing resource usage, adjusting resource requests and limits, or adding more memory to the nodes.

CoreDNS uses the [horizontal cluster proportional autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler) for pod autoscaling. You can edit the `coredns-autoscaler`

to configure the scaling logic for the number of CoreDNS pods. The `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap currently supports two different ConfigMap key values: `linear`

and `ladder`

, which correspond to two supported control modes.

- The
`linear`

controller yields a number of replicas in [min,max] range equivalent to`max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

. - The
`ladder`

controller calculates the number of replicas by consulting two different step functions, one for core scaling and another for node scaling, yielding the max of the two replica values.

For more information on the control modes and ConfigMap format, see the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler#control-patterns-and-configmap-formats).

Important

We recommend a minimum of *two* CoreDNS pod replicas per cluster.

### View the current `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap

Get the current

`coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap using thecommand.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmap coredns-autoscaler --namespace kube-system --output yaml`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`apiVersion: v1 data: ladder: '{"coresToReplicas":[[1,2],[512,3],[1024,4],[2048,5]],"nodesToReplicas":[[1,2],[8,3],[16,4],[32,5]]}' kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-autoscaler namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "..." creationTimestamp: "..."`


Note

The configuration provided serves as a potential starting point, but you should customize the values based on your specific cluster requirements and DNS traffic patterns. One way to determine the appropriate number of replicas for your environment is to use the linear scaling formula: `replicas = max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

to determine replica counts based on core / node count in the cluster.

## CoreDNS vertical pod autoscaling behavior

CoreDNS uses the original provided resource requests/limits when enabling the [add-on autoscaling feature](optimized-addon-scaling) to prevent service unavailability during the CoreDNS pod restart process.

The following table outlines the default requests/limits and request-to-limit ratios for the AKS CoreDNS add-on:

| Resource | Requests/limits | Request-to-limit ratio |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | `100 m / 3 cores` |
Approximately 1:30 |
| Memory | `70 Mi / 500 Mi` |
Approximately 1:7 |

If the recommended CPU requests are *500 m*, VPA adjusts the CPU limits to *15* to maintain this ratio. Similarly, if the recommended memory requests are *700 Mi*, VPA adjusts the memory limit to *5000 Mi*.

VPA sets CoreDNS CPU and memory limits to large values based on the VPA recommended CPU/Memory request and AKS defined request-to-limit ratio. These adjustments are beneficial for handling multiple requests during peak service times. The drawback is that CoreDNS might consume all the CPU and memory available resource on the node when the peak service time.

It's difficult to set a single ideal CPU and memory requests/limits value to meet the requirements of both large cluster and small cluster at the same time. By enabling optimized add-on scaling, you have the flexibility to customize the CoreDNS CPU and memory requests/limits or use VPA to autoscale CoreDNS to meet specific cluster requirements. Keep the following scenarios in mind when deciding whether to customize the resource configuration or use VPA:

- You're considering whether VPA is suitable for your CoreDNS service and want to only view the VPA recommendations. You can disable VPA for CoreDNS by enabling the override VPA update mode to
*Off*if you don't want VPA to automatically update the pods.[Customize the resource configuration in Deployment](customize-resource-configuration)to set the CPU/Memory requests/limits to the value you prefer. - You're considering using VPA but want to restrict the ratio of request-to-limit so VPA won't bump the CPU and Memory limit to large values at one time. You can customize resources in the Deployment and update the CPU and Memory requests/limits value to keep the ratio of request-to-limit to
*1:2*or*1:3*. - If a VPA container policy sets maxAllowed CPU and Memory, the recommended resource requests won't exceed those limits. Customizing the resource configuration allows you to increase or decrease the maxAllowed values and control the recommendations of VPA.

For more information, see [Enable add-on autoscaling on your AKS cluster (Preview)](optimized-addon-scaling).

# Simplified application autoscaling with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple and is a Cloud Native Computing Federation (CNCF) Graduate project.

It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.

The KEDA add-on makes it even easier by deploying a managed KEDA installation, providing you with [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) that you can scale your applications with on your Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster.

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.32.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Architecture

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/) provides two main components:

**KEDA operator**allows end-users to scale workloads in or out from 0 to N instances with support for Kubernetes Deployments, Jobs,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource.**Metrics server**exposes external metrics to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes for autoscaling purposes such as messages in a Kafka topic, or number of events in an Azure event hub. Due to upstream limitations, KEDA must be the only installed external metric adapter.


Learn more about how KEDA works in the [official KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/).

## Installation

KEDA can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the KEDA add-on using an [ARM template](keda-deploy-add-on-arm) or [Azure CLI](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

The KEDA add-on provides a fully supported installation of KEDA that is integrated with AKS.

## Capabilities and features

KEDA provides the following capabilities and features:

- Build sustainable and cost-efficient applications with scale-to-zero
- Scale application workloads to meet demand using
[a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) - Autoscale applications with
`ScaledObjects`

, such as Deployments,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource - Autoscale job-like workloads with
`ScaledJobs`

- Use production-grade security by decoupling autoscaling authentication from workloads
- Bring-your-own external scaler to use tailor-made autoscaling decisions
- Integrate with
[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview)for authentication

Note

If you plan to use workload identity, [enable the workload identity add-on](workload-identity-deploy-cluster) before enabling the KEDA add-on.

## Add-on limitations

The KEDA AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- KEDA's
[HTTP add-on (preview)](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on)to scale HTTP workloads isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - KEDA's
[external scaler for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)to scale based on Azure Cosmos DB change feed isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - Only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of that the KEDA add-on should be the only external metrics server inside the cluster.
- Multiple KEDA installations aren't supported

- It's not recommended to combine KEDA's
`ScaledObject`

with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload. They compete with each other because KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in the background and results in odd scaling behavior.- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created and the KEDA`ScaledObject`

would fail to be created. - If a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created first and then an HPA is created, the HPA creation isn't blocked.

- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA

For general KEDA questions, we recommend [visiting the FAQ overview](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/reference/faq/).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Supported Kubernetes and KEDA versions

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version is installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

# Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create extension instances in an AKS cluster, setting required and optional parameters including options related to updates and configurations. You can also view, list, update, and delete extension instances.

Before you begin, read about [cluster extensions](cluster-extensions).

Note

The examples provided in this article are not complete, and are only meant to showcase functionality. For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, see the [az k8s-extension CLI reference](/en-us/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).The

`Microsoft.ContainerService`

and`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

resource providers must be registered on your subscription. To register these providers, run the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --wait az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait`

An AKS cluster. This cluster must have been created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters. For new clusters created with

`az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters, switch to manage identity by running`az aks update`

with the`--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see[Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version >= 2.16.0 installed. We recommend using the latest version.The latest version of the

`k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extensions. Install the extension by running the following command:`az extension add --name k8s-extension`

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

### Required parameters

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--name` |
Name of the extension instance |
`--extension-type` |
The type of extension you want to install on the cluster. For example: `Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes` |

Name of the AKS cluster on which the extension instance has to be created |
`--resource-group` |
The resource group containing the AKS cluster |
`--cluster-type` |
The cluster type on which the extension instance has to be created. Specify `managedClusters` as it maps to AKS clusters |

### Optional parameters

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--auto-upgrade-minor-version` |
Boolean property that specifies if the extension minor version will be upgraded automatically or not. Default: `true` . If this parameter is set to true, you can't set `version` parameter, as the version will be dynamically updated. If set to `false` , extension won't be auto-upgraded even for patch versions. |
`--version` |
Version of the extension to be installed (specific version to pin the extension instance to). Must not be supplied if auto-upgrade-minor-version is set to `true` . |
`--configuration-settings` |
Settings that can be passed into the extension to control its functionality. Pass values as space separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-settings-file` |
Path to the JSON file having key value pairs to be used for passing in configuration settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-protected-settings` |
These settings are not retrievable using `GET` API calls or `az k8s-extension show` commands, and are thus used to pass in sensitive settings. Pass values as space separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-protected-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-protected-settings-file` |

`--release-namespace` |
This parameter indicates the namespace within which the release is to be created. This parameter is only relevant if `scope` parameter is set to `cluster` . |
`--release-train` |
Extension authors can publish versions in different release trains such as `Stable` , `Preview` , etc. If this parameter isn't set explicitly, `Stable` is used as default. This parameter can't be used when `--auto-upgrade-minor-version` parameter is set to `false` . |
`--target-namespace` |
This parameter indicates the namespace within which the release will be created. Permission of the system account created for this extension instance will be restricted to this namespace. This parameter is only relevant if the `scope` parameter is set to `namespace` . |
`--plan-name` |
Plan ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. |
`--plan-product` |
Product ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. An example of this is the name of the ISV offering used. |
`--plan-publisher` |
Publisher ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. |

```


## List all extensions installed on the cluster

To list all extensions installed on a cluster, use `k8s-extension list`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters.

```
az k8s-extension list --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters
```


## Update extension instance

Note

Refer to documentation for the specific extension type to understand the specific settings in `--configuration-settings`

and `--configuration-protected-settings`

that are able to be updated. For `--configuration-protected-settings`

, all settings are expected to be provided, even if only one setting is being updated. If any of these settings are omitted, those settings will be considered obsolete and deleted.

To update an existing extension instance, use `k8s-extension update`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. The following command updates the auto-upgrade setting for an Azure Machine Learning extension instance:

```
az k8s-extension update --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters
```


### Required parameters for update

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--name` |
Name of the extension instance |
`--extension-type` |
The type of extension you want to install on the cluster. For example: Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes |
`--cluster-name` |
Name of the AKS cluster on which the extension instance has to be created |
`--resource-group` |
The resource group containing the AKS cluster |
`--cluster-type` |
The cluster type on which the extension instance has to be created. Specify `managedClusters` as it maps to AKS clusters |

If updating a Kubernetes application procured through Marketplace, the following parameters are also required:

| Parameter name | Description |

`--plan-name` |
Plan ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. |
`--plan-product` |
Product ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. An example of this is the name of the ISV offering used. |
`--plan-publisher` |
Publisher ID of the extension, found on the Marketplace page in the Azure portal under Usage Information + Support. |

### Optional parameters for update

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--auto-upgrade-minor-version` |
Boolean property that specifies if the extension minor version will be upgraded automatically or not. Default: `true` . If this parameter is set to true, you cannot set `version` parameter, as the version will be dynamically updated. If set to `false` , extension won't be auto-upgraded even for patch versions. |
`--version` |
Version of the extension to be installed (specific version to pin the extension instance to). Must not be supplied if auto-upgrade-minor-version is set to `true` . |
`--configuration-settings` |
Settings that can be passed into the extension to control its functionality. Only the settings that require an update need to be provided. The provided settings would be replaced with the provided values. Pass values as space separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-settings-file` |
Path to the JSON file having key value pairs to be used for passing in configuration settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-protected-settings` |
These settings are not retrievable using `GET` API calls or `az k8s-extension show` commands, and are thus used to pass in sensitive settings. When you update a setting, all settings are expected to be specified. If some settings are omitted, those settings would be considered obsolete and deleted. Pass values as space separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-protected-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-protected-settings-file` |
Path to the JSON file having key value pairs to be used for passing in sensitive settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-protected-settings` can't be used in the same command. |
`--scope` |
Scope of installation for the extension - `cluster` or `namespace` |
`--release-train` |
Extension authors can publish versions in different release trains such as `Stable` , `Preview` , etc. If this parameter isn't set explicitly, `Stable` is used as default. This parameter can't be used when `autoUpgradeMinorVersion` parameter is set to `false` . |

## Delete extension instance

To delete an extension instance on a cluster, use `k8s-extension-delete`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters.

```
az k8s-extension delete --name azureml --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters
```


Note

The Azure resource representing this extension gets deleted immediately. The Helm release on the cluster associated with this extension is only deleted when the agents running on the Kubernetes cluster have network connectivity and can reach out to Azure services again to fetch the desired state.

# Best practices for network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes, by default, operates as a flat network where all pods can communicate freely with each other. This unrestricted connectivity can be convenient for developers but poses significant security risks as applications scale. Imagine an organization deploying multiple microservices, each handling sensitive data, customer transactions, or backend operations. Without any restrictions, any compromised pod could potentially access unauthorized data or disrupt services.

To address these security concerns, [Network Policies in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow administrators to control and restrict traffic between workloads. They provide a declarative way to enforce traffic rules, ensuring secure and controlled network behavior within a cluster.

## What is Kubernetes Network Policy?

A Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that control how pods communicate with each other and with external services. It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, allowing administrators to enforce security and segmentation at the namespace level. By implementing Network Policies, you gain:

**Stronger security posture**: Prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the cluster.**Compliance and governance**: Enforce regulatory requirements by controlling communication pathways.**Reduced blast radius**: Limit the impact of a compromised workload by restricting its network access.

Initially, Network Policies were designed to operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model, enabling basic control over pod-to-pod and external communications. However, advanced network policy engines like Cilium have extended Network Policies to Layer 7 (Application Layer), allowing deeper control over application traffic for modern cloud-native applications.

Network Policies are defined at the namespace level, meaning each policy applies to workloads within a specific namespace. The main components of a Network Policy include:

**Pod selector**: Defines which pods the policy applies to based on labels.**Ingress rules**: Specify the allowed incoming connections.**Egress rules**: Specify the allowed outgoing connections.**Policy types**: Define whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming), egress (outgoing), or both.

## Foundations of building effective network policies

Building effective network policies in Kubernetes isn't just about writing YAML configurations—it requires a deep understanding of your application architecture, traffic patterns, and security requirements. Without a clear picture of how workloads communicate, enforcing security policies can lead to unintended disruptions or gaps in protection. The following sections cover how to systematically approach network policy design.

### Understanding your workload connectivity

Before implementing network policies, you need visibility into how workloads communicate with each other and external services. This step ensures that policies don’t inadvertently block critical traffic while effectively limiting unnecessary exposure.

**Leverage Visibility Tools:**in addition to the network requirements provided by application team you can use tools like[Cilium Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble), and[Retina](https://retina.sh/)help you analyze pod-to-pod traffic, identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database. Identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database.**The importance of labels in network policies:**Traditionally, network security policies have relied on static IP addresses to define traffic rules. This approach is problematic in Kubernetes because pods are ephemeral—created and destroyed frequently, often with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Maintaining security rules based on constantly changing IPs would require continuous updates, making policy management inefficient and error-prone.

Labels solve this challenge by providing a stable way to group workloads. Instead of relying on fixed IPs, Kubernetes Network Policies use labels to define security rules that remain consistent even as pods restart or shift across nodes. For example, a policy can allow communication between pods labeled `app: frontend`

and `app: backend`

, ensuring traffic flows as intended regardless of pod IP changes. This label-based approach is critical for achieving scalable, intent-driven network security in cloud-native environments.

A well-defined labeling strategy simplifies policy management, reduces misconfigurations, and enhances security enforcement across clusters.

**Define Micro-segmentation:**Organizing workloads into security zones (e.g., frontend, backend, database) helps enforce the principle of least privilege. For instance, microservices handling customer transactions should be isolated from general-purpose applications.

### Layered security approach for Kubernetes

Relying solely on basic Kubernetes Network Policies might not be sufficient for all security needs. A layered approach ensures comprehensive protection across different levels of network communication.

**(L3/L4) policies**: The foundation of network security, controlling traffic based on pod labels and namespaces at the IP, port, and protocol level.**FQDN-based policies**: Restrict egress traffic to specific external domains, ensuring workloads can only reach approved external services (for example: only allowing access to*microsoft.com*for API calls).**Layer 7 policies**: Introduces fine-grained control over traffic by filtering requests based on HTTP methods, headers, and paths. This is useful for securing APIs and enforcing application-layer security policies.

### Management of Network Policies

Who should manage network policies? This often depends on an organization’s structure and security requirements. A well-balanced approach allows both security teams and application developers to collaborate effectively.

**Centralized security administration**: Security or networking teams should define baseline policies to enforce global security requirements, such as default deny-all rules or compliance-driven restrictions.**Developer autonomy with guardrails**: Application teams should be able to define service-specific network policies within their namespaces, enabling security while maintaining agility.**Policy lifecycle management**: Regularly reviewing and updating policies ensures that security remains aligned with evolving application architectures. Observability tools can help detect policy misconfigurations and missing rules.

#### Example: Securing a multi-tier web application with Network Policies

**Step 1: Understanding workload connectivity**

- Visibility tools: Use Cilium Hubble to observe how pods communicate.


Mapping connectivity:

Source Destination Protocol Port Frontend Backend TCP 8080 Backend Database TCP 5432 Backend External Payment Gateway TCP 443

**Step 2: Applying labels for policy enforcement**

By labeling workloads correctly, policies can remain stable even if pod IPs change.

`app: frontend`

for UI pods.`app: backend`

for API pods.`app: database`

for DB pods.

**Step 3: Implementing application-level Network Policies**

In this example, we use two layers of network policies: an L3/L4 basic policy to control traffic between microservices and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) policy to control egress traffic with external payment gateway.

| Allow frontend to communicate with backend | Allow backend to access the database | Allow backend to reach external payment API |
|---|---|---|
Policy 1: Frontend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` Policy 2: Backend ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: frontend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` |
Policy 1: Backend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: database` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` Policy 2: Database ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` |
Policy 1: Backend`spec:` ` endpointSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` egress:` ` - toFQDNs:` ` - matchName: payments.example.com` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 443` |

**Step 4: Managing and maintaining policies**

Security and platform teams enforce baseline deny rules.

Baseline policy Platform policy Security - Default deny all traffic - Allow DNS

- Allow Logs- Block traffic

to known

malicious IPs

and domainsEnsuring that the application's network policies comply with platform and security requirements while avoiding any policy violations.

## Azure Powered by Cilium

[Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security for Kubernetes workloads. Unlike traditional CNIs that rely on iptables-based packet filtering, Azure CNI powered by Cilium uses eBPF to operate at the kernel level, enabling efficient and scalable network policy enforcement. On Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cilium is the only supported network policy engine, reflecting Azure’s investment in performance, scalability, and security.
Azure Kubernetes Service integrates Cilium as a managed component, simplifying network security enforcement. Administrators can define Cilium Network Policies directly within their AKS clusters without requiring external controllers.

Cilium extends the usage of labels with Identities. Large clusters with many pods might experience scale issues where constantly updating IP filters occurs with a high pod churn rate. Under the hood, Identities map to labels and allow connections to initiate as soon as the identity resolves rather than needing to update rules on nodes.

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

Use the following command to create a cluster with Azure CNI powered by cilium

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Anatomy of the Cilium Network Policy

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium, you can configure network policies natively in Kubernetes using two available formats:

**The standard**, which supports L3 and L4 policies at ingress or egress of the Pod.`NetworkPolicy`

resource**The extended**, which is available as a CustomResourceDefinition that supports specification of policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

format

With these CRDs, we can define security policies, and Kubernetes automatically distributes these policies to all the nodes in the cluster.

A Network Policy consists of several key components:

**Pod selector**: Specifies which pods the policy applies to using labels.**Policy types**: Determines whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming traffic), egress (outgoing traffic), or both.**Ingress rules**: Defines allowed sources (pods, namespaces, or IP ranges) and ports.**Egress rules**: Defines allowed destinations and ports.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: frontend-egress namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: frontend policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080`


## Advanced Network Policy

Azure Kubernetes services offers the [Advanced Container Networking Service (ACNS)](/en-us/azure/aks/advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium) a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of AKS clusters.

A key feature of ACNS is Container Network Security, which offers advanced security functionalities to safeguard containerized workloads. One notable aspect is the ability to implement advanced network policies, including Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering and Layer 7 (L7) policies, allowing for more granular control over both egress traffic and application-layer communication.

### Secure Egress traffic with FQDN Filtering

Traditionally, network policies in Kubernetes are based on IP addresses. However, in dynamic environments where pod IPs frequently change, managing such policies becomes cumbersome. [FQDN filtering](/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-concepts#overview-of-fqdn-filtering) simplifies this by allowing policies to be defined using domain names instead of IP addresses. This approach provides a more intuitive and user-friendly method of controlling network traffic, allowing organizations to enforce security policies with greater precision and flexibility.

Implementing FQDN filtering in AKS clusters requires enabling ACNS and configuring the necessary policies to define allowed or blocked domains, thereby enhancing the security posture of your containerized applications.

To enable Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), use the flag --enable-acns

#### Example: Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Build a network policy that allows traffic to “bing.com”

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


### Protection and security for APIs with L7 policies

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication, securing these interactions at the network layer alone is no longer sufficient. Standard network policies operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), controlling which pods can communicate, but they lack visibility into the actual API requests being made.

Layer 7 (L7) policies provide the following benefits and features:

**Granular API security**: Enforce policies based on HTTP, gRPC, or Kafka request data, rather than just IP addresses and ports.**Reduced attack surface**: Prevent unauthorized access and mitigate API-based attacks by filtering traffic at the application layer.**Compliance and auditing**: Ensure adherence to security standards by logging and controlling specific API interactions.**Simplified policy management**: Avoid the operational burden of additional sidecar proxies by leveraging built-in Cilium-powered L7 controls.

L7 policies AKS are enabled through ACNS and are available to customers using Azure CNI powered by Cilium. These policies support HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka protocols.

To enforce L7 policies, customers define `CiliumNetworkPolicy`

resources, specifying rules for application-layer traffic control.

#### Example: Enable ACNS on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Allow only GET requests to /api from the frontend pod to the backend service on port 8080

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


## Strategies for network policies

Securing Kubernetes workloads requires a thoughtful approach to defining and enforcing network policies. A well-designed strategy ensures that applications communicate only as intended, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and potential breaches. The following sections cover key strategies for implementing effective Kubernetes Network Policies.

### Adopt a Zero-Trust model

By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted communication between all pods in a cluster. A Zero-Trust approach dictates that no traffic should be trusted by default, and only explicitly allowed communication paths should be permitted. Implementing a default deny-all network policy ensures that only necessary traffic flows between workloads.

Example of a deny-all policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
- Egress
```


### Namespace and multi-tenancy segmentation

In multi-tenant environments, namespaces help isolate workloads. Different teams typically manage their applications within dedicated namespaces, ensuring logical isolation between workloads. This separation is critical when multiple applications run alongside each other. Applying network policies at the namespace scope is often the first step in securing workloads, as it prevents unrestricted lateral movement between applications managed by different teams.

For example, restrict all ingress traffic to a namespace, allowing only traffic from the same namespace:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: restrict-cross-namespace
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
- namespaceSelector:
matchLabels:
name: team-a
```


### Microsegmentation for workload isolation

While namespace-based segmentation is an essential first step in securing multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, application-level microsegmentation provides fine-grained control over how workloads interact within a namespace. Namespace isolation alone does not prevent unintended or unauthorized communication between different applications within the same namespace. This is where pod-level segmentation becomes critical.

For instance, if a frontend service should only talk to a backend service within the same namespace, a policy using pod labels can enforce this restriction:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-to-backend
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 8080
```


This prevents frontend pods from making unintended connections to other services, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement inside the namespace.

By combining namespace-wide isolation with fine-grained application-level policies, teams can implement a multi-layered security model that prevents unauthorized traffic while allowing necessary communication for application functionality.

### Layered security approach

Network security should be implemented in layers, combining multiple levels of enforcement:

**L3/L4 policies**: Restrict traffic at the IP and port level (for example: allow TCP traffic on port 443).**FQDN-based filtering**: Restrict external communication based on domain names rather than IP addresses.**L7 policies**: Control communication based on application-layer attributes (for example: allow only HTTP GET requests to specific API paths).

For example, a Cilium L7 policy can restrict frontend services to only issue GET requests to the backend API:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


This prevents the frontend from making POST or DELETE requests, limiting the attack surface.

### Integrating RBAC with Network Policy management

Role-based access control (RBAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users or teams can create, modify, or delete network policies. Without proper access controls, a misconfigured policy could either expose workloads to unauthorized access or unintentionally block critical application traffic.

By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC in conjunction with network policies, organizations can enforce separation of duties between platform administrators, security teams, and application developers. A typical approach is:

- Platform or security teams define baseline security policies that enforce compliance and restrict external access.
- Application teams are granted limited permissions to create or update network policies only for their respective namespaces.

For example, the following RBAC policy allows developers to create and modify network policies but only within their assigned namespace:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: network-policy-editor
namespace: team-a
rules:
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
resources: ["networkpolicies"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```


This role can then be bound to a specific team using a RoleBinding:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
name: team-a-network-policy-binding
namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer@example.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: network-policy-editor
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


By restricting network policy modifications to designated teams and namespaces, organizations can prevent accidental misconfigurations or unauthorized changes while still allowing flexibility for developers to implement application-specific security policies.

This approach reinforces the principle of least privilege while ensuring that network segmentation strategies remain consistent, secure, and aligned with organizational policies.

## Legacy and third-party solutions

### Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)

Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) is a legacy solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies on AKS. As we continue to evolve our networking stack, we intend to deprecate NPM soon.

We strongly recommend all customers transition to Cilium Network Policy, which provides better performance, scalability, and enhanced security through eBPF-based enforcement. Cilium is the future of network policy in AKS and offers a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to NPM.

### NetworkPolicy support for Windows nodes

AKS doesn't natively support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Windows nodes out of the box. To enable network policies for Windows workloads, you can use Calico for Windows nodes, which is integrated into AKS to simplify deployment. You can enable it using the `--network-policy calico`

flag when creating a cluster.

Microsoft doesn't maintain the Calico images used in this integration. Our support is limited to ensuring Calico is properly integrated with AKS and functions as expected within the platform. Any issues related to Calico upstream bugs, feature requests, or troubleshooting beyond AKS integration should be directed to the Calico open-source community or Tigera, the maintainers of Calico.

### Calico open source – Third-party solution

Calico open source is a widely used third-party solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies. It supports both Linux and Windows nodes and provides advanced networking and security capabilities, including network policy enforcement, workload identity, and encryption.

While Calico is integrated with AKS for Windows network policies (`--network-policy calico`

), it remains an open-source project maintained by Tigera. Microsoft doesn't maintain Calico images and provides limited support focused on ensuring proper integration with AKS. For advanced troubleshooting, feature requests, or issues beyond AKS integration, we recommend reaching out to the Calico open-source community or Tigera.

For Linux nodes, we strongly recommend using Cilium for network policy enforcement. For Windows nodes, we recommend using Calico.

## Conclusion

Network policies are a fundamental part of Kubernetes security, enabling organizations to control traffic flow, enforce workload isolation, and reduce the attack surface. As cloud-native environments evolve, relying solely on basic Layer 3/4 policies is no longer sufficient. Advanced solutions, such as Layer 7 filtering and FQDN-based policies, provide the granular security and flexibility needed to protect modern applications.

By following best practices including zero-trust model, microsegmentation, and adopting scalable solutions like Azure managed Cilium teams can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. As Kubernetes networking continues to evolve, adopting modern, observability-driven approaches will be key to securing workloads effectively.

# Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


```
az aks create \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--node-count 3 \

## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ...

## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx/agentPools/mynpxxx", "name": "mynpxxx", "osType": "Windows", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools" }`

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet frequently asked questions

**Can I deploy VMs in my cluster subnet?**Yes for Azure CNI Node Subnet, the VMs can be deployed in the same subnet as the AKS cluster.

**What source IP do external systems see for traffic that originates in an Azure CNI-enabled pod?**Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. But for

[Azure CNI dynamic IP allocation](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet#dynamic-ip-allocation-mode), no matter the connection is inside the same virtual network or cross virtual networks, the pod IP is always the source address for any traffic from the pod. This is because the[Azure CNI for dynamic IP allocation](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet#dynamic-ip-allocation-mode)implements[Microsoft Azure Container Networking](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking)infrastructure, which gives end-to-end experience. Hence, it eliminates the use of, which is still used by traditional Azure CNI.`ip-masq-agent`

**Can I configure per-pod network policies?**Yes, Kubernetes network policy is available in AKS. To get started, see

[Secure traffic between pods by using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).**Is the maximum number of pods deployable to a node configurable?**With

[Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly.

**Can I use a different subnet within my cluster virtual network for the***Kubernetes service address range*?It's not recommended, but this configuration is possible. The service address range is a set of virtual IPs (VIPs) that Kubernetes assigns to internal services in your cluster. Azure Networking has no visibility into the service IP range of the Kubernetes cluster. The lack of visibility into the cluster's service address range can lead to issues. It's possible to later create a new subnet in the cluster virtual network that overlaps with the service address range. If such an overlap occurs, Kubernetes could assign a service an IP that's already in use by another resource in the subnet, causing unpredictable behavior or failures. By ensuring you use an address range outside the cluster's virtual network, you can avoid this overlap risk. Yes, when you deploy a cluster with the Azure CLI or a Resource Manager template. See

section for later use.

`{ "type": "Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions", "apiVersion": "2022-11-01", "name": "[parameters('extensionResourceName')]", "properties": { "extensionType": "[variables('clusterExtensionTypeName')]", "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true, "releaseTrain": "[variables('releaseTrain')]", "configurationSettings": { "title": "[parameters('app-title')]", "value1": "[parameters('app-value1')]", "value2": "[parameters('app-value2')]" },`

Note

If there are no configuration settings in the ARM template, refer to the application-related documentation in Azure Marketplace or on the partner's website.


## Accept terms and agreements

Before you can deploy a Kubernetes application, you need to accept its terms and agreements. To do so, run the following command, using the values you copied for `plan-publisher`

, `plan-offerID`

, and `plan-name`

.

```
az vm image terms accept --offer <plan-offerID> --plan <plan-name> --publisher <plan-publisher>

# Scale node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As your application workload demands change, you might need to scale the number of nodes in a node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this article, you learn how to manually and automatically scale node pools in AKS.

## Prerequisites for AKS node pool scaling

- An existing AKS cluster with at least one node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with node pools](create-node-pools). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Scale a node pool manually

Scale the number of nodes in a node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool scale`

][az-aks-nodepool-scale] command. The`--node-count`

flag specifies the desired number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the node pool is scaled to five nodes.`az aks nodepool scale \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --node-count 5 \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pools using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Scaling*state with a new count of five nodes:`[ { ... "count": 5, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Scaling", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes for the scale operation to complete. After the scale operation is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Scale a node pool automatically with the cluster autoscaler

You can use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) with multiple node pools, and you can enable it on individual node pools and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

flag. The`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

flags specify the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the cluster autoscaler is enabled with a minimum count of one node and a maximum count of five nodes:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

If you want to disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool, use the [`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the `--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

flag instead of `--update-cluster-autoscaler`

.

## Next steps: Manage node pools in AKS

To learn more about managing node pools in AKS, see [Manage node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](manage-node-pools).

# Overview of FQDN filtering

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

# Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects unscheduled pods, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demand. It also regularly checks nodes that don't have any scheduled pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article helps you understand how the cluster autoscaler works in AKS. It also provides guidance, best practices, and considerations when configuring the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads. If you want to enable, disable, or update the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

## About the cluster autoscaler

Clusters often need a way to scale automatically to adjust to changing application demands, such as between workdays and evenings or weekends. AKS clusters can scale in the following ways:

- The
**cluster autoscaler**periodically checks for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. Manual scaling is disabled when you use the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see[How does scale up work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-up-work). - The
uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) - The
automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage to ensure pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the required CPU and memory resources.[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler)


It's a common practice to enable cluster autoscaler for nodes and either the Vertical Pod Autoscaler or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pods. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, it applies the specified scaling rules when the node pool size is lower than the minimum node count, up to the maximum node count. The cluster autoscaler waits to take effect until a new node is needed in the node pool or until a node might be safely deleted from the current node pool. For more information, see [How does scale down work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-down-work)

## Best practices and considerations

- When implementing
**availability zones with the cluster autoscaler**, we recommend using a single node pool for each zone. You can set the`--balance-similar-node-groups`

parameter to`True`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale up operations. When this approach isn't implemented, scale down operations can disrupt the balance of nodes across zones.

Note

The Cluster Autoscaler is not zone-aware, and zone allocation is handled by the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Sets. The above best practice becomes even more relevant when using zone-based [pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) on a single multi-zonal node pool, as restrictive constraints may leave pods in a pending state, especially in capacity-constrained regions or during zone-down scenarios.

For

**clusters with more than 400 nodes**, we recommend using Azure CNI or Azure CNI Overlay.To

**effectively run workloads concurrently on both Spot and On-demand node pools**, consider using. This approach allows you to scale out nodepools based on assigned priority. The following configuration illustrates this setup.*priority expanders*`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander namespace: kube-system data: priorities: |- 10: - .*spotpool1.* - .*spotpool2.* 50: - .*ondemandpool1.*`

Exercise caution when

**assigning CPU/Memory requests on pods**. The cluster autoscaler scales up based on pending pods rather than CPU/Memory pressure on nodes.For

**clusters concurrently hosting both long-running workloads, like web apps, and short/bursty job workloads**, we recommend separating them into distinct node pools with[Affinity Rules](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)/[expanders](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders).Use

[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)to help prevent unnecessary node drain or scale down operations. Specifying the annotation[cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#cluster-autoscaler-kubernetes-io-safe-to-evict)on the Pod spec will also prevent the pods from being evicted. Use this annotation with caution, as it may cause the Cluster Autoscaler encounter issues when draining a node with a running Pod that includes this annotation.In an autoscaler-enabled node pool, scale down nodes by removing workloads, instead of manually reducing the min/ max count of the node pool. This can be problematic if the node pool is already at maximum capacity or if there are active workloads running on the nodes, potentially causing unexpected behavior by the cluster autoscaler.

Nodes don't scale up if pods have a PriorityClass value below -10. Priority -10 is reserved for

[overprovisioning pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler). For more information, see[Using the cluster autoscaler with Pod Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-cluster-autoscaler-work-with-pod-priority-and-preemption).**Don't combine other node autoscaling mechanisms**, such as Virtual Machine Scale Set autoscalers, with the cluster autoscaler.The cluster autoscaler

**might be unable to scale down if pods can't move, such as in the following situations**:- A directly created pod not backed by a controller object, such as a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
- A pod disruption budget (PDB) that's too restrictive and doesn't allow the number of pods to fall below a certain threshold.
- A pod uses node selectors or anti-affinity that can't be honored if scheduled on a different node.
For more information, see
[What types of pods can prevent the cluster autoscaler from removing a node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node).


Important

**Don't make changes to individual nodes within the autoscaled node pools**. All nodes in the same node group should have uniform capacity, labels, taints and system pods running on them.

- The cluster autoscaler isn't responsible for enforcing a "maximum node count" in a cluster node pool irrespective of pod scheduling considerations. If any non-cluster autoscaler actor sets the node pool count to a number beyond the cluster autoscaler's configured maximum, the cluster autoscaler doesn't automatically remove nodes. The cluster autoscaler scale down behaviors remain scoped to removing underutilized nodes. The sole purpose of the cluster autoscaler's max node count configuration is to enforce an upper limit for scale up operations. It doesn't have any effect on scale down considerations.

## Cluster autoscaler profile

The [cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler-profile-settings) is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler. You can configure the cluster autoscaler profile when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster.

### Optimizing the cluster autoscaler profile

You should fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile settings according to your specific workload scenarios while also considering tradeoffs between performance and cost. This section provides examples that demonstrate those tradeoffs.

It's important to note that the cluster autoscaler profile settings are cluster-wide and applied to all autoscale-enabled node pools. Any scaling actions that take place in one node pool can affect the autoscaling behavior of other node pools, which can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you apply consistent and synchronized profile configurations across all relevant node pools to ensure you get your desired results.

#### Example 1: Optimizing for performance

For clusters that handle substantial and bursty workloads with a primary focus on performance, we recommend increasing the `scan-interval`

and decreasing the `scale-down-utilization-threshold`

. These settings help batch multiple scaling operations into a single call, optimizing scaling time and the utilization of compute read/write quotas. It also helps mitigate the risk of swift scale down operations on underutilized nodes, enhancing the pod scheduling efficiency. Also increase `ok-total-unready-count`

and `max-total-unready-percentage`

.

For clusters with daemonset pods, we recommend setting `ignore-daemonsets-utilization`

to `true`

, which effectively ignores node utilization by daemonset pods and minimizes unnecessary scale down operations. See [profile for bursty workloads](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-bursty-workloads)

#### Example 2: Optimizing for cost

If you want a [cost-optimized profile](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down), we recommend setting the following parameter configurations:

- Reduce
`scale-down-unneeded-time`

, which is the amount of time a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. - Reduce
`scale-down-delay-after-add`

, which is the amount of time to wait after a node is added before considering it for scale down. - Increase
`scale-down-utilization-threshold`

, which is the utilization threshold for removing nodes. - Increase
`max-empty-bulk-delete`

, which is the maximum number of nodes that can be deleted in a single call. - Set
`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

to false. - Increase
`ok-total-unready-count`

and`max-total-unready-percentage`

.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors

If the extension fails to create or update, try suggestions and solutions in the [Azure App Configuration extension troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/extensions/troubleshoot-app-configuration-extension-installation-errors).

## Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider errors via the [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#troubleshooting).

## Delete the extension

If you need to delete the extension and remove Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider from your AKS cluster, you can use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --cluster-type managedClusters --name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider
```


## Next Steps

- Learn more about
[extra settings and preferences you can set on the Azure App Configuration extension](azure-app-configuration-settings). - Once you successfully install Azure App Configuration extension in your AKS cluster, try
[quickstart](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service)to learn how to use it. - See all the supported features of
[Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/reference-kubernetes-provider).

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Use a service principal with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require either a [Microsoft Entra service principal](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or a [managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources. This article describes how to create a Microsoft Entra service principal and use it with your AKS cluster.

Note

For optimal security and ease of use, we recommend using managed identities instead of service principals to authorize access from an AKS cluster to other resources in Azure. A managed identity is a special type of service principal that you can use to get Microsoft Entra credentials without the need to manage and secure credentials. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- If using Azure PowerShell, you need Azure PowerShell version 5.0.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

- You need permissions to register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and to assign the application to a role in your subscription. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you need to ask your Microsoft Entra ID or subscription administrator to assign the necessary permissions or create the service principal for you.

## Considerations when using a service principal

Keep the following considerations in mind when using a Microsoft Entra service principal with AKS:

- The service principal for Kubernetes is a part of the cluster configuration, but don't use this identity to deploy the cluster. Instead,
[create a service principal](#create-a-service-principal)first, then use that service principal to create the AKS cluster. - Every service principal is associated with a Microsoft Entra application. You can associate the service principal for a Kubernetes cluster with any valid Microsoft Entra application name (for example:
`https://www.contoso.org/example`

). The URL for the application doesn't have to be a real endpoint. - When you specify the service principal
**client ID**, use the value of the application ID (`appId`

for Azure CLI or`ApplicationId`

for Azure PowerShell). - On the agent node virtual machines (VMs) in the AKS cluster, the service principal credentials are stored in the
`/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`

file. - When you delete an AKS cluster that you created using the
command or the`az aks create`

cmdlet, the service principal created isn't automatically deleted. See the`New-AzAksCluster`

[steps to delete a service principal](#delete-a-service-principal). - If you're using a service principal from a different Microsoft Entra tenant, there are other considerations around the permissions available when you deploy the cluster. You might not have the appropriate permissions to read and write directory information. For more information, see
[What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

## Create a service principal

Create a service principal using the

command.`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`# Set environment variable SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "name": "http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the values for

`appId`

and`password`

from the output to use when creating the AKS cluster.

Create a service principal using the

command.`New-AzADServicePrincipal`

`# Set environment variable $SpName = <your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $SpName -OutVariable sp`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`Secret : System.Security.SecureString ServicePrincipalNames : {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal} ApplicationId : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : myAKSClusterServicePrincipal Id : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Type :`

The values are stored in a variable that you use when creating the AKS cluster.

Decrypt the value stored in the

**Secret**secure string using the following command.`$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)`


## Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--service-principal`

and`--client-secret`

parameters set to specify the`appId`

and`password`

values.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> APP_ID=<app-id> CLIENT_SECRET=<password-value> # Create the AKS cluster az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --service-principal $APP_ID \ --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Convert the service principal

`ApplicationId`

and`Secret`

to a**PSCredential**object using the following command.`$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($sp.ApplicationId, $sp.Secret)`

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

cmdlet and specify the`New-AzAksCluster`

`ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret`

parameter with the**PSCredential**object as its value.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> # Create the AKS cluster New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ClusterName -ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret $Cred`


Note

If you're using an existing service principal with customized secret, make sure the secret isn't longer than 190 bytes.

## Delegate access to other Azure resources

You can use the service principal for the AKS cluster to access other resources. For example, if you want to deploy your AKS cluster into an existing Azure virtual network (VNet) subnet, connect to ACR, or access keys or secrets in a key vault from your cluster, then you need to delegate access to those resources to the service principal. To delegate access, assign an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role to the service principal.

When you assign roles, you specify the scope for the role assignment, such as a resource group or VNet resource. The role assignment determines what permissions the service principal has on the resource and at what scope.

Important

Permissions granted to a service principal associated with a cluster can take up 60 minutes to propagate.

## Create a role assignment

Note

The scope for a resource needs to be a full resource ID, such as `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup`

or `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupVnet/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet`

.

Create a role assignment using the

command. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`az role assignment create`

`--assignee`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`--scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`az role assignment create \ --assignee <app-id> \ --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User"`


Create a role assignment using the

cmdlet. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`New-AzRoleAssignment`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`-Scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`New-AzRoleAssignment -ApplicationId <app-id> ` -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" ` -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User"`


## Grant access to Azure Container Registry

If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. We recommend following the steps in [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration) to integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal.

## Grant access to networking resources

If you're using advanced networking with a VNet and subnet or public IP addresses in different resource group, you can assign the [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) built-in role on the subnet within the VNet. Alternatively, you can create a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with permissions to access the network resources in that resource group. For more information, see [AKS service permissions](concepts-identity#aks-service-permissions).

## Grant access to storage disks

If you need to access existing disk resources in another resource group, assign one of the following sets of role permissions:

- Create a
[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)and define the*Microsoft.Compute/disks/read*and*Microsoft.Compute/disks/write*role permissions. - Assign the
[Virtual Machine Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor)built-in role on the resource group.

## Grant access to Azure Container Instances

If you use virtual kubelet to integrate with AKS and run Azure Container Instances (ACI) in resource group separate from the AKS cluster, you need to assign *Contributor* permissions to the AKS cluster service principal for the ACI resource group.

## Delete a service principal

Query for the service principal client ID (

`servicePrincipalProfile.clientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecommand with the`az ad sp delete`

`--id`

parameter. The [`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> # Delete the service principal az ad sp delete --id $(az aks show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId \ --output tsv)`


Query for the service principal client ID (

`ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecmdlet with the`Remove-AzADServicePrincipal`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter. The [`Get-AzAksCluster`

][get-azakscluster] cmdlet retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> $ClientId = (Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster ).ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId # Delete the service principal Remove-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $ClientId`


## Resolve service principal credential issues

Azure CLI caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

Azure PowerShell caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

If these credentials expire, you might encounter errors during AKS cluster deployment. If there's an issue with the cached credentials, you might receive an error message similar to the following error message:

```
Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'.
Details: The credentials in ServicePrincipalProfile were invalid. Please see https://aka.ms/aks-sp-help for more details.
Details: adal: Refresh request failed. Status Code = '401'.
```


You can check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command with the

`"[].endDateTime"`

query. The output shows you the `endDateTime`

of your credentials.```
az ad app credential list \
--id <app-id> \
--query "[].endDateTime" \
--output tsv
```


- Check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the
cmdlet. The output shows you the`Get-AzADAppCredential`

`EndDate`

of your credentials.

```
Get-AzADAppCredential -ApplicationId <app-id>
```


**The default expiration time for the service principal credentials is one year**. If your credentials are older than one year, you can [reset the existing credentials](update-credentials#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials) or [create a new service principal](update-credentials#create-a-new-service-principal).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to configure SSH access (preview) on your AKS clusters or node pools, during initial deployment or at a later time.

AKS supports the following configuration options to manage SSH access on cluster nodes:

**Disabled SSH**: Completely disable SSH access to cluster nodes for enhanced security**Entra ID based SSH**: Use Microsoft Entra ID credentials for SSH authentication. Benefits of using Entra ID based SSH:**Centralized identity management**: Use your existing Entra ID identities to access cluster nodes**No SSH key management**: Eliminates the need to generate, distribute, and rotate SSH keys**Enhanced security**: Leverage Entra ID security features like Conditional Access and MFA**Audit and compliance**: Centralized logging of access events through Entra ID logs**Just-in-time access**: Combine with Azure RBAC for granular access control

**Local User SSH**: Traditional SSH key-based authentication for node access

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables for your resource group, cluster name, and location:

```
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group-name>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<your-cluster-name>"
export LOCATION="<your-azure-region>"
```


## Limitations

- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not yet available for Windows node pool.
- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not supported for AKS automatic because of
[node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown)preventing role assignments.

## Configure SSH access

To improve security and support your corporate security requirements or strategy, AKS supports disabling SSH both on the cluster and at the node pool level. Disable SSH introduces a simplified approach compared to configuring [network security group rules](concepts-security#azure-network-security-groups) on the AKS subnet/node network interface card (NIC). Disable SSH only supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools.

When you disable SSH at cluster creation time, it takes effect after the cluster is created. However, when you disable SSH on an existing cluster or node pool, AKS doesn't automatically disable SSH. At any time, you can choose to perform a nodepool upgrade operation. The disable/enable SSH operation takes effect after the node image update is complete.

Note

When you disable SSH at the cluster level, it applies to all existing node pools. Any node pools created after this operation will have SSH enabled by default, and you'll need to run these commands again in order to disable it.

Note

[kubectl debug node](node-access) continues to work after you disable SSH because it doesn't depend on the SSH service.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Disable SSH on a new cluster deployment

By default, the SSH service on AKS cluster nodes is open to all users and pods running on the cluster. You can prevent direct SSH access from any network to cluster nodes to help limit the attack vector if a container in a pod becomes compromised.

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a new cluster, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on all the node pools during cluster creation.Important

After you disable the SSH service, you can't SSH into the cluster to perform administrative tasks or to troubleshoot.

Note

On a newly created cluster, disable SSH will only configure the first system node pool. All other node pools need to be configured at the node pool level.

```
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command to add a node pool, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To disable SSH on an existing cluster, you need to disable SSH for each node pool on this cluster.

### Re-enable SSH access

To re-enable SSH access on a node pool, update the node pool with either `--ssh-access localuser`

(for traditional SSH key-based access) or `--ssh-access entraid`

(for Entra ID based access). See the respective sections for detailed instructions.

You can configure your AKS cluster to use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for SSH authentication to cluster nodes. This eliminates the need to manage SSH keys and allows you to use your Entra ID credentials to access nodes securely.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH on a new cluster

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH authentication during cluster creation.```
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for an existing node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing cluster, you need to enable it for each node pool individually.

Local user SSH access uses traditional SSH key-based authentication. This is the default SSH access method for AKS clusters.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Create an AKS cluster with SSH keys

Use the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to deploy an AKS cluster with an SSH public key. You can either specify the key or a key file using the `--ssh-key-value`

argument, or use `--ssh-access localuser`

to explicitly set local user SSH access.

| SSH parameter | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`--generate-ssh-key` |
If you don't have your own SSH keys, specify `--generate-ssh-key` . The Azure CLI automatically generates a set of SSH keys and saves them in the default directory `~/.ssh/` . |
|
`--ssh-key-value` |
Public key path or key contents to install on node VMs for SSH access. For example, `ssh-rsa AAAAB...snip...UcyupgH azureuser@linuxvm` . |
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
`--ssh-access localuser` |
Explicitly enable local user SSH access with key-based authentication. | |
`--no-ssh-key` |
If you don't require SSH keys, specify this argument. However, AKS automatically generates a set of SSH keys because the Azure Virtual Machine resource dependency doesn't support an empty SSH keys file. As a result, the keys aren't returned and can't be used to SSH into the node VMs. The private key is discarded and not saved. |

Note

If no parameters are specified, the Azure CLI defaults to referencing the SSH keys stored in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

file. If the keys aren't found, the command returns the message `An RSA key file or key value must be supplied to SSH Key Value`

.

**Examples:**

To create a cluster and use the default generated SSH keys:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --generate-ssh-key`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

To explicitly enable local user SSH access:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-access localuser --generate-ssh-key`


### Enable local user SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


### Enable local user SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


Important

For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


### Update SSH public key on an existing AKS cluster

Use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command to update the SSH public key (preview) on your cluster. This operation updates the key on all node pools. You can either specify a key or a key file using the

`--ssh-key-value`

argument.Note

Updating the SSH keys is supported on Azure virtual machine scale sets with AKS clusters.

**Examples:**

To specify a new SSH public key value:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza-xxx'`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`


Important

After you update the SSH key, AKS doesn't automatically update your node pool. At any time, you can choose to perform a [nodepool upgrade operation](node-image-upgrade). The update SSH keys operation takes effect after a node image update is complete. For clusters with [Node Auto-provisioning](node-autoprovision) enabled, a node image update can be performed by applying a new label to the Kubernetes NodePool custom resource.

## Verify SSH service status

After disabling SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is inactive on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is disabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:36:53 UTC; 25min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: inactive (dead)`

, which confirms SSH is disabled on the node.

After enabling Entra ID based SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active and configured for Entra ID authentication on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

After configuring local user SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

# Tutorial - Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this tutorial, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker`

commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) system.

Note

Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Use

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)to clone the sample application to your development environment.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git`

Change into the cloned directory.

`cd aks-store-demo`


## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [ docker-compose-quickstart YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the

[repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main)you cloned.

## Create container images and run application

You can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the

`docker compose`

command:`docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d`

View the created images using the

command.`docker images`

`docker images`

The following condensed example output shows the created images:

`REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID aks-store-demo-product-service latest 72f5cd7e6b84 aks-store-demo-order-service latest 54ad5de546f9 aks-store-demo-store-front latest 1125f85632ae ...`

View the running containers using the

command.`docker ps`

`docker ps`

The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

`CONTAINER ID IMAGE f27fe74cfd0a aks-store-demo-product-service df1eaa137885 aks-store-demo-order-service b3ce9e496e96 aks-store-demo-store-front 31df28627ffa rabbitmq:3.13.2-management-alpine`


## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. * Do not delete the container images* - you use them in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

command.`docker-compose down`

`docker compose down`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample application, created container images for the application, and then tested the application. You learned how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.

# Use Arm-based processor (Arm64) Virtual Machines (VMs) in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster for cost effectiveness

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Arm-based processors (Arm64)](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/cobalt-overview) are power-efficient and cost-effective, but don't compromise on performance. These Arm64 VMs are engineered to efficiently run dynamic, scalable workloads and can deliver up to 50% better price-performance than comparable x86-based VMs for scale-out workloads.

Because of their ability to scale workloads efficiently, Arm64 VMs are well-suited for web or application servers, open-source databases, cloud-native applications, gaming servers, and other high traffic applications.

Note

While a combination of CPU, memory, and networking capacity configurations heavily influences the cost effectiveness of a SKU, Arm64 VM types are recommended for cost optimization.

In this article, you'll learn how to add a Arm64 VM to an existing node pool.

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Limitations

- Arm64 VMs aren't supported for Windows node pools.
- Existing node pools can't be updated to use an Arm64 VM.
- Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS)-enabled node pools are only supported with Arm64 SKUs when using Azure Linux 3.0+.
- Arm64 node pools aren't supported on Defender-enabled clusters with Kubernetes version 1.29.0 or lower.

## Create node pools with Arm64 VMs

The Arm64 processor provides low power compute for your Kubernetes workloads. Arm64 virtual machines can be added to existing clusters even mixing Intel and Arm architecture node pools within a cluster. To create an Arm64 node pool, you need to choose a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series), [Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or [Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series) series virtual machine.

### Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

Use [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) to add a node pool with an Arm64 VM to an existing cluster. Alternatively, if you're using

[Azure Linux 3.0+](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/how-to-enable-azure-linux-3), you can add a node pool with an Arm64 VM and

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled.

Add a node pool with an Arm64 VM

`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

Add a FIPS-enabled node pool with an Arm64 VM

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use the

with`az aks nodepool add`

`--enable-fips-image`

and`--os-sku`

parameters.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $ARM_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --os-sku AzureLinux --enable-fips-image --kubernetes-version 1.31 --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_D2pds_v5`

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see

[Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
Update a node pool with an Arm64 VM to enable FIPS

Limitations:

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)enabled aren't supported with Ubuntu OS. - Node pools with Arm64 VMs and
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)require kubernetes version 1.31+.

Use

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter to enable FIPS on an existing node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

- Node pools with Arm64 VMs and

For more information on verifying FIPS enablement and disabling FIPS, see [Enable FIPS node pools](enable-fips-nodes).

## Verify the node pool uses Arm64

Verify a node pool uses Arm64 using the [ az aks nodepool show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command and verify the

`vmSize`

is a [Dpsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dpsv5-dpdsv5-series),

[Dplsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dplsv5-dpldsv5-series), or

[Epsv5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/epsv5-epdsv5-series)series.

```
az aks nodepool show \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name mynodepool \
--query vmSize
```


The following example output shows the node pool uses Arm64:

```
"Standard_D2pds_v5"
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to add a node pool with an Arm64 VM to an AKS cluster.

# Autoscaling CoreDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to configure and customize CoreDNS autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## Configure CoreDNS horizontal pod scaling

Due to the elastic nature of AKS, it's common to experience sudden spikes in DNS traffic within your clusters. These spikes can lead to an increase in memory consumption by CoreDNS pods. In some cases, this increased memory consumption can cause `Out of memory`

issues.

To preempt this issue, AKS clusters autoscale CoreDNS pods to reduce memory usage per pod. The default settings for this autoscaling logic are stored in the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. However, you might observe that the default autoscaling of CoreDNS pods isn't always aggressive enough to prevent `Out of memory`

issues for your CoreDNS pods. In this case, you can directly modify the `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap. Keep in mind that simply increasing the number of CoreDNS pods without addressing the root cause of the `Out of memory`

issue might only provide a temporary fix. If there's not enough memory available across the nodes where the CoreDNS pods are running, increasing the number of CoreDNS pods won't help. You might need to investigate further and implement appropriate solutions such as optimizing resource usage, adjusting resource requests and limits, or adding more memory to the nodes.

CoreDNS uses the [horizontal cluster proportional autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler) for pod autoscaling. You can edit the `coredns-autoscaler`

to configure the scaling logic for the number of CoreDNS pods. The `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap currently supports two different ConfigMap key values: `linear`

and `ladder`

, which correspond to two supported control modes.

- The
`linear`

controller yields a number of replicas in [min,max] range equivalent to`max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

. - The
`ladder`

controller calculates the number of replicas by consulting two different step functions, one for core scaling and another for node scaling, yielding the max of the two replica values.

For more information on the control modes and ConfigMap format, see the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-proportional-autoscaler#control-patterns-and-configmap-formats).

Important

We recommend a minimum of *two* CoreDNS pod replicas per cluster.

### View the current `coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap

Get the current

`coredns-autoscaler`

ConfigMap using thecommand.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmap coredns-autoscaler --namespace kube-system --output yaml`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`apiVersion: v1 data: ladder: '{"coresToReplicas":[[1,2],[512,3],[1024,4],[2048,5]],"nodesToReplicas":[[1,2],[8,3],[16,4],[32,5]]}' kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-autoscaler namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "..." creationTimestamp: "..."`


Note

The configuration provided serves as a potential starting point, but you should customize the values based on your specific cluster requirements and DNS traffic patterns. One way to determine the appropriate number of replicas for your environment is to use the linear scaling formula: `replicas = max( ceil( cores * 1/coresPerReplica ) , ceil( nodes * 1/nodesPerReplica ) )`

to determine replica counts based on core / node count in the cluster.

## CoreDNS vertical pod autoscaling behavior

CoreDNS uses the original provided resource requests/limits when enabling the [add-on autoscaling feature](optimized-addon-scaling) to prevent service unavailability during the CoreDNS pod restart process.

The following table outlines the default requests/limits and request-to-limit ratios for the AKS CoreDNS add-on:

| Resource | Requests/limits | Request-to-limit ratio |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | `100 m / 3 cores` |
Approximately 1:30 |
| Memory | `70 Mi / 500 Mi` |
Approximately 1:7 |

If the recommended CPU requests are *500 m*, VPA adjusts the CPU limits to *15* to maintain this ratio. Similarly, if the recommended memory requests are *700 Mi*, VPA adjusts the memory limit to *5000 Mi*.

VPA sets CoreDNS CPU and memory limits to large values based on the VPA recommended CPU/Memory request and AKS defined request-to-limit ratio. These adjustments are beneficial for handling multiple requests during peak service times. The drawback is that CoreDNS might consume all the CPU and memory available resource on the node when the peak service time.

It's difficult to set a single ideal CPU and memory requests/limits value to meet the requirements of both large cluster and small cluster at the same time. By enabling optimized add-on scaling, you have the flexibility to customize the CoreDNS CPU and memory requests/limits or use VPA to autoscale CoreDNS to meet specific cluster requirements. Keep the following scenarios in mind when deciding whether to customize the resource configuration or use VPA:

- You're considering whether VPA is suitable for your CoreDNS service and want to only view the VPA recommendations. You can disable VPA for CoreDNS by enabling the override VPA update mode to
*Off*if you don't want VPA to automatically update the pods.[Customize the resource configuration in Deployment](customize-resource-configuration)to set the CPU/Memory requests/limits to the value you prefer. - You're considering using VPA but want to restrict the ratio of request-to-limit so VPA won't bump the CPU and Memory limit to large values at one time. You can customize resources in the Deployment and update the CPU and Memory requests/limits value to keep the ratio of request-to-limit to
*1:2*or*1:3*. - If a VPA container policy sets maxAllowed CPU and Memory, the recommended resource requests won't exceed those limits. Customizing the resource configuration allows you to increase or decrease the maxAllowed values and control the recommendations of VPA.

For more information, see [Enable add-on autoscaling on your AKS cluster (Preview)](optimized-addon-scaling).

# Simplified application autoscaling with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple and is a Cloud Native Computing Federation (CNCF) Graduate project.

It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.

The KEDA add-on makes it even easier by deploying a managed KEDA installation, providing you with [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) that you can scale your applications with on your Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster.

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.32.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Architecture

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/) provides two main components:

**KEDA operator**allows end-users to scale workloads in or out from 0 to N instances with support for Kubernetes Deployments, Jobs,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource.**Metrics server**exposes external metrics to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes for autoscaling purposes such as messages in a Kafka topic, or number of events in an Azure event hub. Due to upstream limitations, KEDA must be the only installed external metric adapter.


Learn more about how KEDA works in the [official KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/).

## Installation

KEDA can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the KEDA add-on using an [ARM template](keda-deploy-add-on-arm) or [Azure CLI](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

The KEDA add-on provides a fully supported installation of KEDA that is integrated with AKS.

## Capabilities and features

KEDA provides the following capabilities and features:

- Build sustainable and cost-efficient applications with scale-to-zero
- Scale application workloads to meet demand using
[a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) - Autoscale applications with
`ScaledObjects`

, such as Deployments,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource - Autoscale job-like workloads with
`ScaledJobs`

- Use production-grade security by decoupling autoscaling authentication from workloads
- Bring-your-own external scaler to use tailor-made autoscaling decisions
- Integrate with
[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview)for authentication

Note

If you plan to use workload identity, [enable the workload identity add-on](workload-identity-deploy-cluster) before enabling the KEDA add-on.

## Add-on limitations

The KEDA AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- KEDA's
[HTTP add-on (preview)](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on)to scale HTTP workloads isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - KEDA's
[external scaler for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)to scale based on Azure Cosmos DB change feed isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - Only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of that the KEDA add-on should be the only external metrics server inside the cluster.
- Multiple KEDA installations aren't supported

- It's not recommended to combine KEDA's
`ScaledObject`

with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload. They compete with each other because KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in the background and results in odd scaling behavior.- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created and the KEDA`ScaledObject`

would fail to be created. - If a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created first and then an HPA is created, the HPA creation isn't blocked.

- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA

For general KEDA questions, we recommend [visiting the FAQ overview](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/reference/faq/).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Supported Kubernetes and KEDA versions

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version is installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

# AKS frequently asked questions

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Support

### Does AKS offer a service-level agreement?

AKS provides service-level agreement (SLA) guarantees in the [Standard pricing tier with the Uptime SLA feature](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

### What is platform support, and what does it include?

Platform support is a reduced support plan for unsupported n-3 version clusters. Platform support includes only Azure infrastructure support.

For more information, see the [platform support policy](supported-kubernetes-versions).

### Does AKS automatically upgrade my unsupported clusters?

Yes, AKS initiates auto-upgrades for unsupported clusters. When a cluster in an n-3 version (where *n* is the latest supported AKS minor version that's generally available) is about to drop to n-4, AKS automatically upgrades the cluster to n-2 to remain in an AKS support policy.

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions](supported-kubernetes-versions), [Planned maintenance windows](planned-maintenance), and [Automatic upgrades](auto-upgrade-cluster).

### Can I apply Azure reservation discounts to my AKS agent nodes?

AKS agent nodes are billed as standard Azure virtual machines (VMs). If you purchased [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) for the VM size that you're using in AKS, those discounts are automatically applied.

## Operations

### Can I run Windows Server containers on AKS?

Yes, AKS supports Windows Server containers. For more information, see the [Windows Server on AKS FAQ](windows-faq).

### What Linux operating systems (OS) are supported on AKS?

AKS supports four main Linux operating systems, including Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), [Azure Linux OS Guard](use-azure-linux-os-guard), and [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks). When specifying `--os-type Linux`

during node pool creation or cluster creation, the default OS is Ubuntu Linux.

### What operating systems (OS) versions are supported on AKS?

When using `--os-sku Ubuntu`

, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 22.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.25-1.34. AKS defaults to Ubuntu 24.04 in Kubernetes versions 1.35+.
When using `--os-sku AzureLinux`

, AKS defaults to Azure Linux 3.0 in Kubernetes versions 1.32+.
In some scenarios, like FIPS-enabled node pools, the default OS version might differ. See [node images](node-images) for more information.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between Azure tenants?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between tenants is currently unsupported.

### Can I move or migrate my cluster between subscriptions?

No. Moving your AKS cluster between subscriptions is currently unsupported.

### Can I move my AKS cluster or AKS infrastructure resources to other resource groups or rename them?

No. Moving or renaming your AKS cluster and its associated resources isn't supported.

### Can I restore my cluster after I delete it?

No. You can't restore your cluster after you delete it. When you delete your cluster, the node resource group and all its resources are also deleted.

If you want to keep any of your resources, move them to another resource group before you delete your cluster. If you want to protect against accidental deletes, you can lock the AKS managed resource group that's hosting your cluster resources by using [Node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown).

### Can I scale my AKS cluster to zero?

You can completely [stop a running AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster) or [scale or autoscale all or specific User node pools](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0) to zero.

You can't directly scale [system node pools](use-system-pools) to zero.

### Can I use the virtual machine scale set APIs to scale manually?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS APIs (`az aks scale`

).

### Can I use virtual machine scale sets to manually scale to zero nodes?

No. Scale operations that use the virtual machine scale set APIs aren't supported. You can use the AKS API to scale nonsystem node pools to zero or [stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Can I stop or deallocate all my VMs?

No. This configuration isn't supported. [Stop your cluster](start-stop-cluster) instead.

### Why are two resource groups created with AKS?

AKS builds upon many Azure infrastructure resources, including virtual machine scale sets, virtual networks, and managed disks. These integrations enable you to apply many of the core capabilities of the Azure platform within the managed Kubernetes environment provided by AKS. For example, you can use most Azure VM types directly with AKS, and you can use Azure Reservations to receive discounts on those resources automatically.

To enable this architecture, each AKS deployment spans two resource groups:

- You create the first resource group. This group contains only the Kubernetes service resource. The AKS resource provider automatically creates the second resource group during deployment. An example of the second resource group is
*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. For information on how to specify the name of this second resource group, see the next section. - The second resource group, known as the
*node resource group*, contains all of the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster. These resources include the Kubernetes node VMs, virtual networking, and storage. By default, the node resource group has a name like*MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_eastus*. AKS automatically deletes the node resource group whenever you delete the cluster. Use this resource group only for resources that share the cluster's lifecycle.

Note

Modifying any resource under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action and will cause cluster operation failures. You can prevent changes from being made to the node resource group. [Block users from modifying resources](node-resource-group-lockdown) that the AKS cluster manages.

### Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?

By default, AKS names the node resource group *MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location*, but you can provide your own name.

To specify your own resource group name, install the [aks-preview](/en-us/cli/azure/aks) Azure CLI extension version *0.3.2* or later. When you create an AKS cluster by using the `az aks create`

command, use the `--node-resource-group`

parameter and specify a name for the resource group. If you use an [Azure Resource Manager template](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/2022-09-01/managedclusters) to deploy an AKS cluster, you can define the resource group name by using the `nodeResourceGroup`

property.

- The Azure resource provider automatically creates the secondary resource group.
- You can specify a custom resource group name only when you create the cluster.

As you work with the node resource group, you can't:

- Specify an existing resource group for the node resource group.
- Specify a different subscription for the node resource group.
- Change the node resource group name after you create the cluster.
- Specify names for the managed resources within the node resource group.
- Modify or delete Azure-created tags of managed resources within the node resource group.

### Can I modify tags and other properties of the AKS resources in the node resource group?

You might get unexpected scaling and upgrading errors if you modify or delete Azure-created tags and other resource properties in the node resource group. AKS allows you to create and modify custom tags created by end users, and you can add those tags when you [create a node pool](manage-node-pools#specify-a-taint-label-or-tag-for-a-node-pool). You might want to create or modify custom tags, for example, to assign a business unit or cost center. Another option is to apply policies and modify tags through the AKS resource itself—specifically via the cluster and node pools..

Azure-created tags are created for their respective Azure services, and you should always allow them. For AKS, there are the `aks-managed`

and `k8s-azure`

tags. Modifying any *Azure-created tags* on resources under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action, which breaks the service-level objective (SLO).

Note

In the past, the tag name `Owner`

was reserved for AKS to manage the public IP that's assigned on the front-end IP of the load balancer. Now, services use the `aks-managed`

prefix. For legacy resources, don't use Azure policies to apply the `Owner`

tag name. Otherwise, all resources on your AKS cluster deployment and update operations will break. This restriction doesn't apply to newly created resources.

### Why do I see aks-managed prefixed Helm releases on my cluster, and why does their revision count keep increasing?

AKS uses Helm to deliver components to your cluster. You can safely ignore `aks-managed`

prefixed Helm releases. Continuously increasing revisions on these Helm releases are expected and safe.

## Quotas, limits, and region availability

### Which Azure regions currently provide AKS?

For a complete list of available regions, see [AKS regions and availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across regions?

No. AKS clusters are regional resources and can't span regions. For guidance on how to create an architecture that includes multiple regions, see [best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery](operator-best-practices-multi-region#plan-for-multiregion-deployment).

### Can I spread an AKS cluster across availability zones?

Yes, you can deploy an AKS cluster across one or more [availability zones](availability-zones) in [regions that support them](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-region-support).

### Can I have different VM sizes in a single cluster?

Yes, you can use different VM sizes in your AKS cluster by creating [multiple node pools](create-node-pools).

### What's the size limit on a container image in AKS?

AKS doesn't set a limit on the container image size. But the larger the image, the higher the memory demand. A larger size could potentially exceed resource limits or the overall available memory of worker nodes. By default, memory for VM size Standard_DS2_v2 for an AKS cluster is set to 7 GiB.

When a container image is excessively large, as in the terabyte (TB) range, the kubelet might not be able to pull it from your container registry to a node because of the lack of disk space.

For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update doesn't automatically run and apply the latest updates. You should perform an upgrade on the cluster and the Windows Server node pools in your AKS cluster. Follow a regular schedule based on the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, and then removes the older nodes. For more information on this process, see [Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

### Are AKS images required to run as root?

The following images have functional requirements to run as root, and exceptions must be filed for any policies:

*mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/coredns**mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/calico/node**mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes-csi/azuredisk-csi*

## Security, access, and identity

### Can I limit who has access to the Kubernetes API server?

Yes, there are two options for limiting access to the API server:

- Use
[API server authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges)if you want to maintain a public endpoint for the API server but restrict access to a set of trusted IP ranges. - Use a
[private cluster](private-clusters)if you want to limit the API server to be accessible*only*from within your virtual network.

### Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes?

AKS patches CVEs that have a *vendor fix* every week. CVEs without a fix are waiting on a vendor fix before they can be remediated. The AKS images are automatically updated within 30 days. We recommend that you apply an updated node image on a regular cadence to ensure that the latest patched images and OS patches are all applied and current. You can do this task:

- Manually, through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.
- By upgrading your AKS cluster. The cluster upgrades
[cordon and drain nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)automatically. Then it brings a new node online with the latest Ubuntu image and a new patch version or a minor Kubernetes version. For more information, see[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster). - By using a
[node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade).

### Are there security threats that target AKS that I should be aware of?

Microsoft provides guidance for other actions that you can take to secure your workloads through services like [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks). For information on a security threat related to AKS and Kubernetes, see [New large-scale campaign targets Kubeflow](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/new-large-scale-campaign-targets-kubeflow/ba-p/2425750) (June 8, 2021).

### Does AKS store any customer data outside the cluster's region?

No. All data is stored in the cluster's region.

### How can I avoid permission ownership setting slow issues when the volume has numerous files?

Traditionally, if your pod is running as a nonroot user (which it should), you must specify an `fsGroup`

parameter inside the pod's security context so that the volume is readable and writable by the pod. For more information on this requirement, see [Configure a security context for a pod or container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

A side effect of setting `fsGroup`

is that each time a volume is mounted, Kubernetes must use the `chown()`

and `chmod()`

commands recursively for all the files and directories inside the volume (with a few exceptions). This scenario happens even if group ownership of the volume already matches the requested `fsGroup`

parameter. This configuration might be expensive for larger volumes with lots of small files, which can cause pod startup to take a long time. This scenario was a known problem before v1.20. The workaround is to set the pod to run as root:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: security-context-demo
spec:
securityContext:
runAsUser: 0
fsGroup: 0
```


The issue was resolved with Kubernetes version 1.20. For more information, see [Kubernetes 1.20: Granular control of volume permission changes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/14/kubernetes-release-1.20-fsgroupchangepolicy-fsgrouppolicy/).

## Networking

### How does the managed control plane communicate with my nodes?

AKS uses a secure tunnel communication to allow the `api-server`

and individual node kubelets to communicate, even on separate virtual networks. The tunnel is secured through mutual Transport Layer Security encryption. The current main tunnel that AKS uses is [Konnectivity, previously known as apiserver-network-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/). Verify that all network rules follow the [Azure required network rules and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)](limit-egress-traffic).

### Can my pods use the API server FQDN instead of the cluster IP?

Yes, you can add the annotation `kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

to pods to set the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`

variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This modification is useful in cases where your cluster egress is done via a layer 7 firewall. An example is when you use Azure Firewall with application rules.

### Can I configure NSGs with AKS?

AKS doesn't apply network security groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. AKS modifies only the network interface NSG settings. If you're using Container Network Interface (CNI), you also must ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod classless interdomain routing (CIDR) ranges. If you're using kubenet, you must also ensure that the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic between the node and pod CIDR. For more information, see [Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

### How does time synchronization work in AKS?

AKS nodes run the chrony service, which pulls time from the local host. Containers that run on pods get the time from the AKS nodes. Applications that open inside a container use time from the container of the pod.

## Add-ons, extensions, and integrations

### Can I use custom VM extensions?

No. AKS is a managed service. Manipulation of the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) resources isn't supported. To install custom components, use the Kubernetes APIs and mechanisms. For example, use DaemonSets to install any required components.

### What Kubernetes admission controllers does AKS support? Can admission controllers be added or removed?

AKS supports the following [admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/):

`NamespaceLifecycle`

`LimitRanger`

`ServiceAccount`

`DefaultIngressClass`

`DefaultStorageClass`

`DefaultTolerationSeconds`

`MutatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`

`ResourceQuota`

`PodNodeSelector`

`PodTolerationRestriction`

`ExtendedResourceToleration`


Currently, you can't modify the list of admission controllers in AKS.

### Can I use admission controller webhooks on AKS?

Yes, you can use admission controller webhooks on AKS. We recommend that you exclude internal AKS namespaces, which are marked with the `control-plane`

label. For example:

```
namespaceSelector:
matchExpressions:
- key: control-plane
operator: DoesNotExist
```


AKS firewalls the API server egress so that your admission controller webhooks need to be accessible from within the cluster.

### Can admission controller webhooks affect kube-system and internal AKS namespaces?

To protect the stability of the system and prevent custom admission controllers from affecting internal services in the `kube-system`

namespace, AKS has an admissions enforcer, which automatically excludes `kube-system`

and AKS internal namespaces. This service ensures that the custom admission controllers don't affect the services that run in `kube-system`

.

If you have a critical use case for deploying something on `kube-system`

(not recommended) in support of your custom admission webhook, you can add the following label or annotation so that the admissions enforcer ignores it:

- Label:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": "true"`

- Annotation:
`"admissions.enforcer/disabled": true`


### Is Azure Key Vault integrated with AKS?

[Azure Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver](csi-secrets-store-driver) provides native integration of Azure Key Vault into AKS.

### Can I use FIPS cryptographic libraries with deployments on AKS?

Nodes that are enabled with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are now supported on Linux-based node pools. For more information, see [Add a FIPS-enabled node pool](enable-fips-nodes).

### How are AKS add-ons updated?

Any patch, including a security patch, is automatically applied to the AKS cluster. Anything bigger than a patch, like major or minor version changes (which can have breaking changes to your deployed objects), are updated when you update your cluster if a new release is available. For information on when a new release is available, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

### What is the purpose of the AKS Linux extension that I see installed on my Linux virtual machine scale sets instances?

The AKS Linux extension is an Azure VM extension that installs and configures monitoring tools on Kubernetes worker nodes. The extension is installed on all new and existing Linux nodes. It configures the following monitoring tools:

[Node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter): Collects hardware telemetry from the VM and makes it available by using a metrics endpoint. Then, a monitoring tool, such as Prometheus, can scrap these metrics.[Node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector): Aims to make various node problems visible to upstream layers in the cluster management stack. It's a systemd unit that runs on each node, detects node problems, and reports them to the cluster's API server by using`Events`

and`NodeConditions`

.[ig](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2260320): Is an eBPF-powered open-source framework for debugging and observing Linux and Kubernetes systems. It provides a set of tools (or gadgets) that gather relevant information that users can use to identify the cause of performance issues, crashes, or other anomalies. Notably, its independence from Kubernetes enables users to employ it also for debugging control plane issues.

These tools help provide observability around many node health-related problems, such as:

**Infrastructure daemon issues:**NTP service down**Hardware issues:**Bad CPU, memory, or disk**Kernel issues:**Kernel deadlock, corrupted file system**Container runtime issues:**Unresponsive runtime daemon

The extension *doesn't require extra outbound access* to any URLs, IP addresses, or ports beyond the [documented AKS egress requirements](limit-egress-traffic). It doesn't require any special permissions granted in Azure. It uses `kubeconfig`

to connect to the API server to send the monitoring data that's collected.

## Troubleshoot cluster issues

### Why is it taking so long to delete my cluster?

Most clusters are deleted upon user request. In some cases, especially cases where you bring your own resource group or perform cross-resource group tasks, deletion can take more time or even fail. If you have an issue with deletions, double-check that you don't have locks on the resource group. Also make sure that any resources outside the resource group are disassociated from the resource group.

### Why is it taking so long to create or update my cluster?

If you have issues with creating and updating clusters, make sure that you don't have any assigned policies or service constraints that might block your AKS cluster from managing resources like VMs, load balancers, or tags.

### If I have pods or deployments in NodeLost or Unknown states, can I still upgrade my cluster?

You can, but we don't recommend it. Perform updates when the state of the cluster is known and healthy.

### If I have a cluster with one or more nodes in an Unhealthy state, or if it's shut down, can I perform an upgrade?

No. Delete or remove any nodes that are in a failed state or otherwise from the cluster before you upgrade.

### I tried to delete my cluster, but I see the error "[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed."

Most commonly, this error arises if you have one or more NSGs in use that are still associated with the cluster. Remove them and attempt to delete the cluster again.

### I ran an upgrade, but now my pods are in crash loops and readiness probes fail.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

### My cluster was working, but suddenly I can't provision load balancers or mount persistent volume claims.

Confirm that your service principal isn't expired. For more information, see [AKS service principal](kubernetes-service-principal) and [AKS update credentials](update-credentials).

## Retirements and deprecations

### Which Linux OS versions are deprecated on AKS?

Starting on March 17, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=485795). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

### Which Windows OS versions are deprecated on AKS?

Starting on March 01, 2026, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2019 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.33+ can't use Windows Server 2019. Starting on April 01, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=aks-will-stop-support-for-windows-server-2019-on-march-1-2026). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
Starting on March 15, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2022 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.36+ can't use Windows Server 2022. Starting on April 01, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=ws2022-retirement-aks).

# Best practices for network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes, by default, operates as a flat network where all pods can communicate freely with each other. This unrestricted connectivity can be convenient for developers but poses significant security risks as applications scale. Imagine an organization deploying multiple microservices, each handling sensitive data, customer transactions, or backend operations. Without any restrictions, any compromised pod could potentially access unauthorized data or disrupt services.

To address these security concerns, [Network Policies in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow administrators to control and restrict traffic between workloads. They provide a declarative way to enforce traffic rules, ensuring secure and controlled network behavior within a cluster.

## What is Kubernetes Network Policy?

A Network Policy in Kubernetes is a set of rules that control how pods communicate with each other and with external services. It provides fine-grained control over network traffic, allowing administrators to enforce security and segmentation at the namespace level. By implementing Network Policies, you gain:

**Stronger security posture**: Prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the cluster.**Compliance and governance**: Enforce regulatory requirements by controlling communication pathways.**Reduced blast radius**: Limit the impact of a compromised workload by restricting its network access.

Initially, Network Policies were designed to operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) of the OSI model, enabling basic control over pod-to-pod and external communications. However, advanced network policy engines like Cilium have extended Network Policies to Layer 7 (Application Layer), allowing deeper control over application traffic for modern cloud-native applications.

Network Policies are defined at the namespace level, meaning each policy applies to workloads within a specific namespace. The main components of a Network Policy include:

**Pod selector**: Defines which pods the policy applies to based on labels.**Ingress rules**: Specify the allowed incoming connections.**Egress rules**: Specify the allowed outgoing connections.**Policy types**: Define whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming), egress (outgoing), or both.

## Foundations of building effective network policies

Building effective network policies in Kubernetes isn't just about writing YAML configurations—it requires a deep understanding of your application architecture, traffic patterns, and security requirements. Without a clear picture of how workloads communicate, enforcing security policies can lead to unintended disruptions or gaps in protection. The following sections cover how to systematically approach network policy design.

### Understanding your workload connectivity

Before implementing network policies, you need visibility into how workloads communicate with each other and external services. This step ensures that policies don’t inadvertently block critical traffic while effectively limiting unnecessary exposure.

**Leverage Visibility Tools:**in addition to the network requirements provided by application team you can use tools like[Cilium Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble), and[Retina](https://retina.sh/)help you analyze pod-to-pod traffic, identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database. Identify which services need to communicate and define their ingress and egress dependencies. For example, a frontend might need to reach a backend API, but it shouldn’t talk directly to a database.**The importance of labels in network policies:**Traditionally, network security policies have relied on static IP addresses to define traffic rules. This approach is problematic in Kubernetes because pods are ephemeral—created and destroyed frequently, often with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Maintaining security rules based on constantly changing IPs would require continuous updates, making policy management inefficient and error-prone.

Labels solve this challenge by providing a stable way to group workloads. Instead of relying on fixed IPs, Kubernetes Network Policies use labels to define security rules that remain consistent even as pods restart or shift across nodes. For example, a policy can allow communication between pods labeled `app: frontend`

and `app: backend`

, ensuring traffic flows as intended regardless of pod IP changes. This label-based approach is critical for achieving scalable, intent-driven network security in cloud-native environments.

A well-defined labeling strategy simplifies policy management, reduces misconfigurations, and enhances security enforcement across clusters.

**Define Micro-segmentation:**Organizing workloads into security zones (e.g., frontend, backend, database) helps enforce the principle of least privilege. For instance, microservices handling customer transactions should be isolated from general-purpose applications.

### Layered security approach for Kubernetes

Relying solely on basic Kubernetes Network Policies might not be sufficient for all security needs. A layered approach ensures comprehensive protection across different levels of network communication.

**(L3/L4) policies**: The foundation of network security, controlling traffic based on pod labels and namespaces at the IP, port, and protocol level.**FQDN-based policies**: Restrict egress traffic to specific external domains, ensuring workloads can only reach approved external services (for example: only allowing access to*microsoft.com*for API calls).**Layer 7 policies**: Introduces fine-grained control over traffic by filtering requests based on HTTP methods, headers, and paths. This is useful for securing APIs and enforcing application-layer security policies.

### Management of Network Policies

Who should manage network policies? This often depends on an organization’s structure and security requirements. A well-balanced approach allows both security teams and application developers to collaborate effectively.

**Centralized security administration**: Security or networking teams should define baseline policies to enforce global security requirements, such as default deny-all rules or compliance-driven restrictions.**Developer autonomy with guardrails**: Application teams should be able to define service-specific network policies within their namespaces, enabling security while maintaining agility.**Policy lifecycle management**: Regularly reviewing and updating policies ensures that security remains aligned with evolving application architectures. Observability tools can help detect policy misconfigurations and missing rules.

#### Example: Securing a multi-tier web application with Network Policies

**Step 1: Understanding workload connectivity**

- Visibility tools: Use Cilium Hubble to observe how pods communicate.


Mapping connectivity:

Source Destination Protocol Port Frontend Backend TCP 8080 Backend Database TCP 5432 Backend External Payment Gateway TCP 443

**Step 2: Applying labels for policy enforcement**

By labeling workloads correctly, policies can remain stable even if pod IPs change.

`app: frontend`

for UI pods.`app: backend`

for API pods.`app: database`

for DB pods.

**Step 3: Implementing application-level Network Policies**

In this example, we use two layers of network policies: an L3/L4 basic policy to control traffic between microservices and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) policy to control egress traffic with external payment gateway.

| Allow frontend to communicate with backend | Allow backend to access the database | Allow backend to reach external payment API |
|---|---|---|
Policy 1: Frontend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` Policy 2: Backend ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: frontend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 8080` |
Policy 1: Backend egress`to:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: database` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` Policy 2: Database ingress`from:` ` - podSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 5432` |
Policy 1: Backend`spec:` ` endpointSelector:` ` matchLabels:` ` app: backend` ` egress:` ` - toFQDNs:` ` - matchName: payments.example.com` ` ports:` ` - protocol: TCP` ` port: 443` |

**Step 4: Managing and maintaining policies**

Security and platform teams enforce baseline deny rules.

Baseline policy Platform policy Security - Default deny all traffic - Allow DNS

- Allow Logs- Block traffic

malicious IPs

and domainsEnsuring that the application's network policies comply with platform and security requirements while avoiding any policy violations.

## Azure Powered by Cilium

[Azure Container Network Interface (CNI) powered by Cilium](/en-us/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security for Kubernetes workloads. Unlike traditional CNIs that rely on iptables-based packet filtering, Azure CNI powered by Cilium uses eBPF to operate at the kernel level, enabling efficient and scalable network policy enforcement. On Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Cilium is the only supported network policy engine, reflecting Azure’s investment in performance, scalability, and security.
Azure Kubernetes Service integrates Cilium as a managed component, simplifying network security enforcement. Administrators can define Cilium Network Policies directly within their AKS clusters without requiring external controllers.

Cilium extends the usage of labels with Identities. Large clusters with many pods might experience scale issues where constantly updating IP filters occurs with a high pod churn rate. Under the hood, Identities map to labels and allow connections to initiate as soon as the identity resolves rather than needing to update rules on nodes.

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

Use the following command to create a cluster with Azure CNI powered by cilium

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Anatomy of the Cilium Network Policy

With Azure CNI powered by Cilium, you can configure network policies natively in Kubernetes using two available formats:

**The standard**, which supports L3 and L4 policies at ingress or egress of the Pod.`NetworkPolicy`

resource**The extended**, which is available as a CustomResourceDefinition that supports specification of policies at Layers 3-7 for both ingress and egress.`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

format

With these CRDs, we can define security policies, and Kubernetes automatically distributes these policies to all the nodes in the cluster.

A Network Policy consists of several key components:

**Pod selector**: Specifies which pods the policy applies to using labels.**Policy types**: Determines whether the policy applies to ingress (incoming traffic), egress (outgoing traffic), or both.**Ingress rules**: Defines allowed sources (pods, namespaces, or IP ranges) and ports.**Egress rules**: Defines allowed destinations and ports.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: frontend-egress namespace: default spec: podSelector: matchLabels: app: frontend policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - podSelector: matchLabels: app: backend ports: - protocol: TCP port: 8080`


## Advanced Network Policy

Azure Kubernetes services offers the [Advanced Container Networking Service (ACNS)](/en-us/azure/aks/advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium) a suite of services designed to enhance the networking capabilities of AKS clusters.

A key feature of ACNS is Container Network Security, which offers advanced security functionalities to safeguard containerized workloads. One notable aspect is the ability to implement advanced network policies, including Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering and Layer 7 (L7) policies, allowing for more granular control over both egress traffic and application-layer communication.

### Secure Egress traffic with FQDN Filtering

Traditionally, network policies in Kubernetes are based on IP addresses. However, in dynamic environments where pod IPs frequently change, managing such policies becomes cumbersome. [FQDN filtering](/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-concepts#overview-of-fqdn-filtering) simplifies this by allowing policies to be defined using domain names instead of IP addresses. This approach provides a more intuitive and user-friendly method of controlling network traffic, allowing organizations to enforce security policies with greater precision and flexibility.

Implementing FQDN filtering in AKS clusters requires enabling ACNS and configuring the necessary policies to define allowed or blocked domains, thereby enhancing the security posture of your containerized applications.

To enable Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), use the flag --enable-acns

#### Example: Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Build a network policy that allows traffic to “bing.com”

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


### Protection and security for APIs with L7 policies

As modern applications increasingly rely on APIs for communication, securing these interactions at the network layer alone is no longer sufficient. Standard network policies operate at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), controlling which pods can communicate, but they lack visibility into the actual API requests being made.

Layer 7 (L7) policies provide the following benefits and features:

**Granular API security**: Enforce policies based on HTTP, gRPC, or Kafka request data, rather than just IP addresses and ports.**Reduced attack surface**: Prevent unauthorized access and mitigate API-based attacks by filtering traffic at the application layer.**Compliance and auditing**: Ensure adherence to security standards by logging and controlling specific API interactions.**Simplified policy management**: Avoid the operational burden of additional sidecar proxies by leveraging built-in Cilium-powered L7 controls.

L7 policies AKS are enabled through ACNS and are available to customers using Azure CNI powered by Cilium. These policies support HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka protocols.

To enforce L7 policies, customers define `CiliumNetworkPolicy`

resources, specifying rules for application-layer traffic control.

#### Example: Enable ACNS on an existing cluster

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


#### Example: Allow only GET requests to /api from the frontend pod to the backend service on port 8080

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


## Strategies for network policies

Securing Kubernetes workloads requires a thoughtful approach to defining and enforcing network policies. A well-designed strategy ensures that applications communicate only as intended, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and potential breaches. The following sections cover key strategies for implementing effective Kubernetes Network Policies.

### Adopt a Zero-Trust model

By default, Kubernetes allows unrestricted communication between all pods in a cluster. A Zero-Trust approach dictates that no traffic should be trusted by default, and only explicitly allowed communication paths should be permitted. Implementing a default deny-all network policy ensures that only necessary traffic flows between workloads.

Example of a deny-all policy:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
- Egress
```


### Namespace and multi-tenancy segmentation

In multi-tenant environments, namespaces help isolate workloads. Different teams typically manage their applications within dedicated namespaces, ensuring logical isolation between workloads. This separation is critical when multiple applications run alongside each other. Applying network policies at the namespace scope is often the first step in securing workloads, as it prevents unrestricted lateral movement between applications managed by different teams.

For example, restrict all ingress traffic to a namespace, allowing only traffic from the same namespace:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: restrict-cross-namespace
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
ingress:
- from:
- namespaceSelector:
matchLabels:
name: team-a
```


### Microsegmentation for workload isolation

While namespace-based segmentation is an essential first step in securing multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, application-level microsegmentation provides fine-grained control over how workloads interact within a namespace. Namespace isolation alone does not prevent unintended or unauthorized communication between different applications within the same namespace. This is where pod-level segmentation becomes critical.

For instance, if a frontend service should only talk to a backend service within the same namespace, a policy using pod labels can enforce this restriction:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-to-backend
namespace: team-a
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 8080
```


This prevents frontend pods from making unintended connections to other services, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement inside the namespace.

By combining namespace-wide isolation with fine-grained application-level policies, teams can implement a multi-layered security model that prevents unauthorized traffic while allowing necessary communication for application functionality.

### Layered security approach

Network security should be implemented in layers, combining multiple levels of enforcement:

**L3/L4 policies**: Restrict traffic at the IP and port level (for example: allow TCP traffic on port 443).**FQDN-based filtering**: Restrict external communication based on domain names rather than IP addresses.**L7 policies**: Control communication based on application-layer attributes (for example: allow only HTTP GET requests to specific API paths).

For example, a Cilium L7 policy can restrict frontend services to only issue GET requests to the backend API:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: frontend-l7-policy
namespace: default
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
app: backend
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "8080"
protocol: TCP
rules:
http:
- method: "GET"
path: "/api"
```


This prevents the frontend from making POST or DELETE requests, limiting the attack surface.

### Integrating RBAC with Network Policy management

Role-based access control (RBAC) plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users or teams can create, modify, or delete network policies. Without proper access controls, a misconfigured policy could either expose workloads to unauthorized access or unintentionally block critical application traffic.

By leveraging Kubernetes RBAC in conjunction with network policies, organizations can enforce separation of duties between platform administrators, security teams, and application developers. A typical approach is:

- Platform or security teams define baseline security policies that enforce compliance and restrict external access.
- Application teams are granted limited permissions to create or update network policies only for their respective namespaces.

For example, the following RBAC policy allows developers to create and modify network policies but only within their assigned namespace:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
name: network-policy-editor
namespace: team-a
rules:
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
resources: ["networkpolicies"]
verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```


This role can then be bound to a specific team using a RoleBinding:

```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
name: team-a-network-policy-binding
namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer@example.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: network-policy-editor
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


By restricting network policy modifications to designated teams and namespaces, organizations can prevent accidental misconfigurations or unauthorized changes while still allowing flexibility for developers to implement application-specific security policies.

This approach reinforces the principle of least privilege while ensuring that network segmentation strategies remain consistent, secure, and aligned with organizational policies.

## Legacy and third-party solutions

### Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM)

Azure Network Policy Manager (NPM) is a legacy solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies on AKS. As we continue to evolve our networking stack, we intend to deprecate NPM soon.

We strongly recommend all customers transition to Cilium Network Policy, which provides better performance, scalability, and enhanced security through eBPF-based enforcement. Cilium is the future of network policy in AKS and offers a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to NPM.

### NetworkPolicy support for Windows nodes

AKS doesn't natively support Kubernetes NetworkPolicy for Windows nodes out of the box. To enable network policies for Windows workloads, you can use Calico for Windows nodes, which is integrated into AKS to simplify deployment. You can enable it using the `--network-policy calico`

flag when creating a cluster.

Microsoft doesn't maintain the Calico images used in this integration. Our support is limited to ensuring Calico is properly integrated with AKS and functions as expected within the platform. Any issues related to Calico upstream bugs, feature requests, or troubleshooting beyond AKS integration should be directed to the Calico open-source community or Tigera, the maintainers of Calico.

### Calico open source – Third-party solution

Calico open source is a widely used third-party solution for enforcing Kubernetes network policies. It supports both Linux and Windows nodes and provides advanced networking and security capabilities, including network policy enforcement, workload identity, and encryption.

While Calico is integrated with AKS for Windows network policies (`--network-policy calico`

), it remains an open-source project maintained by Tigera. Microsoft doesn't maintain Calico images and provides limited support focused on ensuring proper integration with AKS. For advanced troubleshooting, feature requests, or issues beyond AKS integration, we recommend reaching out to the Calico open-source community or Tigera.

For Linux nodes, we strongly recommend using Cilium for network policy enforcement. For Windows nodes, we recommend using Calico.

## Conclusion

Network policies are a fundamental part of Kubernetes security, enabling organizations to control traffic flow, enforce workload isolation, and reduce the attack surface. As cloud-native environments evolve, relying solely on basic Layer 3/4 policies is no longer sufficient. Advanced solutions, such as Layer 7 filtering and FQDN-based policies, provide the granular security and flexibility needed to protect modern applications.

By following best practices including zero-trust model, microsegmentation, and adopting scalable solutions like Azure managed Cilium teams can enhance security while maintaining operational efficiency. As Kubernetes networking continues to evolve, adopting modern, observability-driven approaches will be key to securing workloads effectively.

# Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with API Server VNet Integration

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configured with API Server VNet Integration projects the API server endpoint directly into a delegated subnet in the VNet where AKS is deployed. API Server VNet Integration enables network communication between the API server and the cluster nodes without requiring a private link or tunnel. The API server is available behind an internal load balancer VIP in the delegated subnet, which the nodes are configured to utilize. By using API Server VNet Integration, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only.

## API server connectivity

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure subscription. Your cluster or node pool is in your Azure subscription. The server and the virtual machines that make up the cluster nodes can communicate with each other through the API server VIP and pod IPs that are projected into the delegated subnet.

API Server VNet Integration is supported for public or private clusters. You can add or remove public access after cluster provisioning. Unlike non-VNet integrated clusters, the agent nodes always communicate directly with the private IP address of the API server internal load balancer (ILB) IP without using DNS. All node to API server traffic is kept on private networking, and no tunnel is required for API server to node connectivity. Out-of-cluster clients needing to communicate with the API server can do so normally if public network access is enabled. If public network access is disabled, you should follow the same private DNS setup methodology as standard [private clusters](private-clusters).

## Prerequisites

- You must have Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed. You can check your version using the
`az --version`

command.

## Limitations

- API Server VNet Integration does not support
[Virtual Network Encryption](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview). Clusters deployed on**v3 or earlier AKS node SKUs**(which do not support VNet Encryption) are allowed but traffic will not be encrypted. Clusters deployed on**v4 or later AKS node SKUs**(which support VNet Encryption) are blocked because encrypted VNets are incompatible with API Server VNet Integration. See[AKS supported VM SKUs](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes)for details.

## Availability

- API Server VNet Integration is available in all GA public cloud regions except eastus2 and qatarcentral. We are continually working on enabling this feature in these regions and will update this page when these regions become available.

## Create an AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using managed VNet

You can configure your AKS clusters with API Server VNet Integration in managed VNet or bring-your-own VNet mode. You can create them as public clusters (with API server access available via a public IP) or private clusters (where the API server is only accessible via private VNet connectivity). You can also toggle between a public and private state without redeploying your cluster.

## Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using bring-your-own VNet

When using bring-your-own VNet, you must create and delegate an API server subnet to `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same virtual network. The minimum supported API server subnet size is a */28*.

The cluster identity needs permissions to both the API server subnet and the node subnet. Lack of permissions at the API server subnet can cause a provisioning failure.

Warning

An AKS cluster reserves at least 9 IPs in the subnet address space. Running out of IP addresses may prevent API server scaling and cause an API server outage.

### Create a resource group

- Create a resource group using the
command.`az group create`


```

## Convert an existing AKS cluster to API Server VNet Integration

Warning

**API Server VNet Integration is a one-way, capacity-sensitive feature.**

**Manual restart required.**

After enabling API Server VNet Integration using`az aks update --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

, due to control plane resource transition, you must immediately restart the cluster for the change to take effect. This restart is not automated. Delaying the restart increases the risk of capacity becoming unavailable, which can prevent the API server from starting. The cluster restart also ensures that all nodes reliably reconnect to the new API server endpoint.**Capacity is validated, but not reserved.**

AKS validates regional capacity when you enable the feature on an existing cluster, but this validation does not reserve capacity. If the restart is delayed and capacity becomes unavailable in the meantime, the cluster may fail to start after a stop or restart. Clusters that enabled this feature before general availability (GA), or that have not yet restarted since enablement, will not undergo capacity validation.**Feature cannot be disabled.**

Once enabled, the feature is permanent. You cannot disable API Server VNet Integration.

This upgrade performs a node-image version upgrade on all node pools and restarts all workloads while they undergo a rolling image upgrade.

Warning

Converting a cluster to API Server VNet Integration results in a change of the API Server IP address, though the hostname remains the same. If the IP address of the API server has been configured in any firewalls or network security group rules, those rules may need to be updated.

Update your cluster to API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


## Enable or disable private cluster mode on an existing cluster with API Server VNet Integration

AKS clusters configured with API Server VNet Integration can have public network access/private cluster mode enabled or disabled without redeploying the cluster. The API server hostname doesn't change, but public DNS entries are modified or removed if necessary.

Note

`--disable-private-cluster`

is currently in preview. For more information, see [Reference and support levels](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-types-and-status).

### Enable private cluster mode

Enable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-private-cluster`


### Disable private cluster mode

Disable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --disable-private-cluster`


## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name>`


## Expose the API server through Private Link

You can expose the API server endpoint of a private cluster with API Server VNet Integration using Azure Private Link. The following steps show how to create a Private Link Service (PLS) in the cluster VNet and connect to it from another VNet or subscription using a Private Endpoint.

### Create an API Server VNet Integration Private cluster

Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`


For more guidance on how to set up Private Link with API Server VNet Integration, see [Private Link with API Server VNet Integration](private-apiserver-vnet-integration-cluster).

## NSG security rules

All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. But if you have added NSG rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, ensure that the NSG security rules permit the following types of communication:

# Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create extension instances in an AKS cluster, setting required and optional parameters including options related to updates and configurations. You can also view, list, update, and delete extension instances.

Before you begin, read about [cluster extensions](cluster-extensions).

Note

The examples provided in this article are not complete, and are only meant to showcase functionality. For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, see the [az k8s-extension CLI reference](/en-us/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).The

`Microsoft.ContainerService`

and`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

resource providers must be registered on your subscription. To register these providers, run the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --wait az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait`

An AKS cluster. This cluster must have been created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters. For new clusters created with

`az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters, switch to manage identity by running`az aks update`

with the`--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see[Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version >= 2.16.0 installed. We recommend using the latest version.The latest version of the

`k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extensions. Install the extension by running the following command:`az extension add --name k8s-extension`

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

### Required parameters

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--name` |

# Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

While you can route egress traffic through an Azure Load Balancer, there are limitations on the number of outbound flows of traffic you can have. Azure NAT Gateway allows up to 64,512 outbound UDP and TCP traffic flows per IP address with a maximum of 16 IP addresses.

This article shows you how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a managed NAT gateway and a user-assigned NAT gateway for egress traffic. It also shows you how to disable OutboundNAT on Windows.

## Before you begin

- Make sure you're using the latest version of
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Make sure you're using Kubernetes version 1.20.x or above.
- Managed NAT gateway is incompatible with custom virtual networks.

Important

In non-private clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Create an AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway

- Create an AKS cluster with a new managed NAT gateway using the
command with the`az aks create`

`--outbound-type managedNATGateway`

,`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

, and`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameters. If you want the NAT gateway to operate out of a specific availability zone, specify the zone using`--zones`

. - If no zone is specified when creating a managed NAT gateway, then NAT gateway is deployed to "no zone" by default. When NAT gateway is placed in
**no zone**, Azure places the resource in a zone for you. For more information on non-zonal deployment model, see[non-zonal NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#non-zonal). - A managed NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones.

The following commands first create the required resource group, then the AKS cluster with a managed NAT gateway.

```
export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
export MY_AKS="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX"
az group create --name $MY_RG --location "eastus2"
```


Results:

```
{
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx",
"location": "eastus2",
"managedBy": null,
"name": "myResourceGroupxxx",
"properties": {
"provisioningState": "Succeeded"
},
"tags": null,
"type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```


```
az aks create \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--node-count 3 \
--outbound-type managedNATGateway \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 2 \
--nat-gateway-idle-timeout 4 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


- Update the outbound IP address or idle timeout using the
command with the`az aks update`

`--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count`

or`--nat-gateway-idle-timeout`

parameter.

The following example updates the NAT gateway managed outbound IP count for the AKS cluster to 5.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $MY_RG \
--name $MY_AKS \
--nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count 5
```


Results:

```
{
"aadProfile": null,
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
...
"name": "nodepool1",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx",
"fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
"id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx",
"name": "myNatClusterxxx",
...
"resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx",
...
"provisioningState": "Succeeded",
...
"type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster with a user-assigned NAT gateway

This configuration requires bring-your-own networking (via [Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni)) and that the NAT gateway is preconfigured on the subnet. The following commands create the required resources for this scenario.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3) export MY_RG="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az group create --name $MY_RG --location southcentralus`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroupxxx", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`

Create a managed identity for network permissions and store the ID to

`$IDENTITY_ID`

for later use.`export IDENTITY_NAME="myNatClusterId$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export IDENTITY_ID=$(az identity create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $IDENTITY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myNatClusterIdxxx`

Create a public IP for the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network public-ip create`

`export PIP_NAME="myNatGatewayPip$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $PIP_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --sku standard`

Results:

`{ "publicIp": { "ddosSettings": null, "dnsSettings": null, "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx", "ipAddress": null, "ipTags": [], "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayPipxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "sku": { "name": "Standard", "tier": "Regional" }, "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses", ... } }`

Create the NAT gateway using the

command.`az network nat gateway create`

`export NATGATEWAY_NAME="myNatGateway$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network nat gateway create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --public-ip-addresses $PIP_NAME`

Results:

`{ "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/natGateways/myNatGatewayxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myNatGatewayxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "publicIpAddresses": [ { "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myNatGatewayPipxxx" } ], ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/natGateways" }`

Important

A single NAT gateway resource can't be used across multiple availability zones. To ensure zone-resiliency, it is recommended to deploy a NAT gateway resource to each availability zone and assign to subnets containing AKS clusters in each zone. For more information on this deployment model, see

[NAT gateway for each zone](/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#zonal-nat-gateway-resource-for-each-zone-in-a-region-to-create-zone-resiliency). If no zone is configured for NAT gateway, the default zone placement is "no zone", in which Azure places NAT gateway into a zone for you.Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`export VNET_NAME="myVnet$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az network vnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $VNET_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/20`

Results:

`{ "newVNet": { "addressSpace": { "addressPrefixes": [ "172.16.0.0/20" ] }, ... "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx", "location": "southcentralus", "name": "myVnetxxx", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks", ... } }`

Create a subnet in the virtual network using the NAT gateway and store the ID to

`$SUBNET_ID`

for later use.`export SUBNET_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" export SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \ --name $SUBNET_NAME \ --address-prefixes 172.16.0.0/22 \ --nat-gateway $NATGATEWAY_NAME \ --query id \ --output tsv)`

Results:

`/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnetxxx/subnets/myNatClusterxxx`

Create an AKS cluster using the subnet with the NAT gateway and the managed identity using the

command.`az aks create`

`export AKS_NAME="myNatCluster$RANDOM_SUFFIX" az aks create \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --name $AKS_NAME \ --location southcentralus \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \ --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway \ --assign-identity $IDENTITY_ID \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Results:

`{ "aadProfile": null, "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "name": "nodepool1", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... } ], "dnsPrefix": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx", "fqdn": "myNatClusterxxx-dns-xxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx", "name": "myNatClusterxxx", ... "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" }`


## Disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Windows OutboundNAT can cause certain connection and communication issues with your AKS pods. An example issue is node port reuse. In this example, Windows OutboundNAT uses ports to translate your pod IP to your Windows node host IP, which can cause an unstable connection to the external service due to a port exhaustion issue.

Windows enables OutboundNAT by default. You can now manually disable OutboundNAT when creating new Windows agent pools.

### Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster with v1.26 or above. If you're using Kubernetes version 1.25 or older, you need to
[update your deployment configuration](tutorial-kubernetes-upgrade-cluster).

### Limitations

- You can't set cluster outbound type to LoadBalancer. You can set it to NAT Gateway or UDR:
[NAT Gateway](nat-gateway): NAT Gateway can automatically handle NAT connection and is more powerful than Standard Load Balancer. You might incur extra charges with this option.[UDR (UserDefinedRouting)](limit-egress-traffic): You must keep port limitations in mind when configuring routing rules.- If you need to switch from a load balancer to NAT Gateway, you can either add a NAT gateway into the VNet or run
to update the outbound type.`az aks upgrade`


Note

UserDefinedRouting has the following limitations:

- SNAT by Load Balancer (must use the default OutboundNAT) has "64 ports on the host IP".
- SNAT by Azure Firewall (disable OutboundNAT) has 2496 ports per public IP.
- SNAT by NAT Gateway (disable OutboundNAT) has 64512 ports per public IP.
- If the Azure Firewall port range isn't enough for your application, you need to use NAT Gateway.
- Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per
[IANA RFC 1918 or shared address space per IANA RFC 6598](/en-us/azure/firewall/snat-private-range).

### Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows

Manually disable OutboundNAT for Windows when creating new Windows agent pools using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

flag.Note

You can use an existing AKS cluster, but you might need to update the outbound type and add a node pool to enable

`--disable-windows-outbound-nat`

.The following command adds a Windows node pool to an existing AKS cluster, disabling OutboundNAT.

`export WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME="win$(head -c 1 /dev/urandom | xxd -p)" az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $MY_RG \ --cluster-name $MY_AKS \ --name $WIN_NODEPOOL_NAME \ --node-count 3 \ --os-type Windows \ --disable-windows-outbound-nat`

Results:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupxxx/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myNatClusterxxx/agentPools/mynpxxx", "name": "mynpxxx", "osType": "Windows", "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools" }`

# AKS Legacy Container Networking Interfaces (CNI)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), while [Azure CNI Overlay](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay) and [Azure CNI Pod Subnet](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet) are recommended for most scenarios, legacy networking models such as Azure CNI Node Subnet and kubenet are still available and supported. These legacy models offer different approaches to pod IP address management and networking, each with its own set of capabilities and considerations. This article provides an overview of these legacy networking options, detailing their prerequisites, deployment parameters, and key characteristics to help you understand their roles and how they can be used effectively within your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for Azure CNI Node Subnet:

The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.

AKS clusters can't use

`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least

[Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor)permissions on the subnet within the virtual network. If you want to define a[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

`Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`


The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a

[delegated subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, make sure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see
[Network security groups](concepts-network#network-security-groups).

## Azure CNI Node Subnet

With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.

With Azure CNI Node Subnet, each pod receives an IP address in the IP subnet and can communicate directly with other pods and services. Your clusters can be as large as the IP address range you specify. However, you must plan the IP address range in advance, and all the IP addresses are consumed by the AKS nodes based on the maximum number of pods they can support. Advanced network features and scenarios such as [virtual nodes](virtual-nodes-cli) or Network Policies (either Azure or Calico) are supported with Azure CNI.

### Deployment parameters

When you create an AKS cluster, the following parameters are configurable for Azure CNI networking:

**Virtual network**: The virtual network into which you want to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. You can create a new virtual network or use an existing one. If you want to use an existing virtual network, make sure it's in the same location and Azure subscription as your Kubernetes cluster. For information about the limits and quotas for an Azure virtual network, see [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

**Subnet**: The subnet within the virtual network where you want to deploy the cluster. You can add new subnets into the virtual network during the cluster creation process. For hybrid connectivity, the address range shouldn't overlap with any other virtual networks in your environment.

**Azure Network Plugin**: When Azure network plugin is used, the internal LoadBalancer service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Local" can't be accessed from VMs with an IP in clusterCIDR that doesn't belong to AKS cluster.

**Kubernetes service address range**: This parameter is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal [services](concepts-network-services) in your cluster. This range can't be updated after you create your cluster. You can use any private address range that satisfies the following requirements:

- Must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster.
- Must not overlap with any other virtual networks with which the cluster virtual network peers.
- Must not overlap with any on-premises IPs.
- Must not be within the ranges
`169.254.0.0/16`

,`172.30.0.0/16`

,`172.31.0.0/16`

, or`192.0.2.0/24`

.

While it's possible to specify a service address range within the same virtual network as your cluster, we don't recommend it. Overlapping IP ranges can result in unpredictable behavior. For more information, see the [FAQ](#azure-cni-pod-subnet-frequently-asked-questions). For more information on Kubernetes services, see [Services](concepts-network-services) in the Kubernetes documentation.

**Kubernetes DNS service IP address**: The IP address for the cluster's DNS service. This address must be within the *Kubernetes service address range*. Don't use the first IP address in your address range. The first address in your subnet range is used for the *kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local* address.

**Azure CNI**: That same basic*/24*subnet range can only support a maximum of*8*nodes in the cluster. This node count can only support up to*240*pods, with a default maximum of 30 pods per node.

Note

These maximums don't take into account upgrade or scale operations. In practice, you can't run the maximum number of nodes the subnet IP address range supports. You must leave some IP addresses available for scaling or upgrading operations.

## Virtual network peering and ExpressRoute connections

You can use [Azure virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) or [ExpressRoute connections](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) with *Azure CNI* to provide on-premises connectivity. Make sure you plan your IP addresses carefully to prevent overlap and incorrect traffic routing. For example, many on-premises networks use a *10.0.0.0/8* address range that's advertised over the ExpressRoute connection. We recommend creating your AKS clusters in Azure virtual network subnets outside of this address range, such as *172.16.0.0/16*.

For more information, see [Compare network models and their support scopes](concepts-network-cni-overview).

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet frequently asked questions

**Can I deploy VMs in my cluster subnet?**Yes for Azure CNI Node Subnet, the VMs can be deployed in the same subnet as the AKS cluster.

**What source IP do external systems see for traffic that originates in an Azure CNI-enabled pod?**Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. But for

[Azure CNI dynamic IP allocation](concepts-network-azure-cni-pod-subnet#dynamic-ip-allocation-mode), no matter the connection is inside the same virtual network or cross virtual networks, the pod IP is always the source address for any traffic from the pod.

Hence, it eliminates the use of, which is still used by traditional Azure CNI.`ip-masq-agent`

**Can I configure per-pod network policies?**Yes, Kubernetes network policy is available in AKS. To get started, see

[Secure traffic between pods by using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).**Is the maximum number of pods deployable to a node configurable?**With

[Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. Systems in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster see the pod IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. Systems outside the AKS cluster virtual network see the node IP as the source address for any traffic from the pod. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow.**Can I deploy VMs in my cluster subnet?**Yes.

# Scale node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As your application workload demands change, you might need to scale the number of nodes in a node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this article, you learn how to manually and automatically scale node pools in AKS.

## Prerequisites for AKS node pool scaling

- An existing AKS cluster with at least one node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with node pools](create-node-pools). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Scale a node pool manually

Scale the number of nodes in a node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool scale`

][az-aks-nodepool-scale] command. The`--node-count`

flag specifies the desired number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the node pool is scaled to five nodes.`az aks nodepool scale \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --node-count 5 \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pools using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Scaling*state with a new count of five nodes:`[ { ... "count": 5, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Scaling", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes for the scale operation to complete. After the scale operation is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Scale a node pool automatically with the cluster autoscaler

You can use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) with multiple node pools, and you can enable it on individual node pools and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

flag. The`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

flags specify the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the cluster autoscaler is enabled with a minimum count of one node and a maximum count of five nodes:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

If you want to disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool, use the [`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the `--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

flag instead of `--update-cluster-autoscaler`

.

# Overview of FQDN filtering

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Containerized environments present unique security challenges. Traditional network security methods, often reliant on IP-based filtering, can become cumbersome and less effective as IP addresses frequently change. Additionally, understanding network traffic patterns and identifying potential threats can be complex.

FQDN filtering offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for managing network policies. By defining these policies based on domain names rather than IP addresses, organizations can significantly simplify the process of policy management. This approach eliminates the need for frequent updates that are typically required when IP addresses change, as a result reducing the administrative burden and minimizing the risk of configuration errors.

In a Kubernetes cluster, pod IP addresses can change often, which makes it challenging to secure the pods with security policies using IP addresses. FQDN filtering allows you to create pod level policies using domain names rather than IP addresses, which eliminates the need to update policies when an IP address changes.

Note

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater is required in order to use Container Network security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

## Components of FQDN filtering

**Cilium Agent**: The Cilium Agent is a critical networking component that runs as a DaemonSet within Azure CNI clusters powered by Cilium. It handles networking, load balancing, and network policies for pods in the cluster. For pods with enforced FQDN policies, the Cilium Agent redirects packets to the ACNS Security Agent for DNS resolution and updates the network policy using the FQDN-IP mappings obtained from the ACNS Security Agent.

**ACNS Security Agent**: ACNS Security Agent runs as DaemonSet in Azure CNI powered by Cilium cluster with Advanced Container Networking services enabled. It handles DNS resolution for pods and on successful DNS resolution, it updates Cilium Agent with FQDN to IP mappings.

## How FQDN filtering works

When FQDN Filtering is enabled, DNS requests are first evaluated to determine if they should be allowed after which pods can only access specified domain names based on the network policy. The Cilium Agent marks DNS request packets originating from the pods, redirecting them to the ACNS Security Agent. This redirection occurs only for pods that are enforcing FQDN policies.

The ACNS Security Agent then decides whether to forward a DNS request to the DNS server based on the policy criteria. If permitted, the request is sent to the DNS server, and upon receiving the response, the ACNS Security Agent updates the Cilium Agent with FQDN mappings. This allows the Cilium Agent to update the network policy within the policy engine. The following image illustrates the high-level flow of FQDN Filtering.

## Key benefits

**Scalable security policy management**: Cluster and security admins don't have to update security policies each time an IP address changes making operations more efficient.

**Enhanced security compliance**: FQDN filtering supports a Zero Trust security model. Network traffic is restricted to trusted domains only mitigating risks from unauthorized access.

**Resilient Policy enforcement**: The ACNS Security Agent that is implemented with FQDN filtering ensures that DNS resolution continues seamlessly even if the Cilium agent goes down and policies continue to remain enforced. This implementation critically ensures that security and stability are maintained in dynamic and distributed environments.

## Considerations:

Container Network Security features require Azure CNI Powered by Cilium and Kubernetes version 1.29 and above.

Supported by

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP): FQDN filtering can be applied cluster wide via`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

.

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you cannot use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempts to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods may exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP(s), Kafka and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images may encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```

# Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects unscheduled pods, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demand. It also regularly checks nodes that don't have any scheduled pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article helps you understand how the cluster autoscaler works in AKS. It also provides guidance, best practices, and considerations when configuring the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads. If you want to enable, disable, or update the cluster autoscaler for your AKS workloads, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in AKS](cluster-autoscaler).

## About the cluster autoscaler

Clusters often need a way to scale automatically to adjust to changing application demands, such as between workdays and evenings or weekends. AKS clusters can scale in the following ways:

- The
**cluster autoscaler**periodically checks for pods that can't be scheduled on nodes because of resource constraints. The cluster then automatically increases the number of nodes. Manual scaling is disabled when you use the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see[How does scale up work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-up-work). - The
uses the Metrics Server in a Kubernetes cluster to monitor the resource demand of pods. If an application needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand.[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler) - The
automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage to ensure pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the required CPU and memory resources.[Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler)


It's a common practice to enable cluster autoscaler for nodes and either the Vertical Pod Autoscaler or Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for pods. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, it applies the specified scaling rules when the node pool size is lower than the minimum node count, up to the maximum node count. The cluster autoscaler waits to take effect until a new node is needed in the node pool or until a node might be safely deleted from the current node pool. For more information, see [How does scale down work?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-scale-down-work)

## Best practices and considerations

- When implementing
**availability zones with the cluster autoscaler**, we recommend using a single node pool for each zone. You can set the`--balance-similar-node-groups`

parameter to`True`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale up operations. When this approach isn't implemented, scale down operations can disrupt the balance of nodes across zones.

Note

The Cluster Autoscaler is not zone-aware, and zone allocation is handled by the underlying Virtual Machine Scale Sets. The above best practice becomes even more relevant when using zone-based [pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) on a single multi-zonal node pool, as restrictive constraints may leave pods in a pending state, especially in capacity-constrained regions or during zone-down scenarios.

For

**clusters with more than 400 nodes**, we recommend using Azure CNI or Azure CNI Overlay.To

**effectively run workloads concurrently on both Spot and On-demand node pools**, consider using. This approach allows you to scale out nodepools based on assigned priority. The following configuration illustrates this setup.*priority expanders*`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-autoscaler-priority-expander namespace: kube-system data: priorities: |- 10: - .*spotpool1.* - .*spotpool2.* 50: - .*ondemandpool1.*`

Exercise caution when

**assigning CPU/Memory requests on pods**. The cluster autoscaler scales up based on pending pods rather than CPU/Memory pressure on nodes.For

**clusters concurrently hosting both long-running workloads, like web apps, and short/bursty job workloads**, we recommend separating them into distinct node pools with[Affinity Rules](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#node-affinity)/[expanders](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-are-expanders).Use

[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)to help prevent unnecessary node drain or scale down operations. Specifying the annotation[cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#cluster-autoscaler-kubernetes-io-safe-to-evict)on the Pod spec will also prevent the pods from being evicted. Use this annotation with caution, as it may cause the Cluster Autoscaler encounter issues when draining a node with a running Pod that includes this annotation.In an autoscaler-enabled node pool, scale down nodes by removing workloads, instead of manually reducing the min/ max count of the node pool. This can be problematic if the node pool is already at maximum capacity or if there are active workloads running on the nodes, potentially causing unexpected behavior by the cluster autoscaler.

Nodes don't scale up if pods have a PriorityClass value below -10. Priority -10 is reserved for

[overprovisioning pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler). For more information, see[Using the cluster autoscaler with Pod Priority and Preemption](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-does-cluster-autoscaler-work-with-pod-priority-and-preemption).**Don't combine other node autoscaling mechanisms**, such as Virtual Machine Scale Set autoscalers, with the cluster autoscaler.The cluster autoscaler

**might be unable to scale down if pods can't move, such as in the following situations**:- A directly created pod not backed by a controller object, such as a Deployment or ReplicaSet.
- A pod disruption budget (PDB) that's too restrictive and doesn't allow the number of pods to fall below a certain threshold.
- A pod uses node selectors or anti-affinity that can't be honored if scheduled on a different node.
For more information, see
[What types of pods can prevent the cluster autoscaler from removing a node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#what-types-of-pods-can-prevent-ca-from-removing-a-node).


Important

**Don't make changes to individual nodes within the autoscaled node pools**. All nodes in the same node group should have uniform capacity, labels, taints and system pods running on them.

- The cluster autoscaler isn't responsible for enforcing a "maximum node count" in a cluster node pool irrespective of pod scheduling considerations. If any non-cluster autoscaler actor sets the node pool count to a number beyond the cluster autoscaler's configured maximum, the cluster autoscaler doesn't automatically remove nodes. The cluster autoscaler scale down behaviors remain scoped to removing underutilized nodes. The sole purpose of the cluster autoscaler's max node count configuration is to enforce an upper limit for scale up operations. It doesn't have any effect on scale down considerations.

## Cluster autoscaler profile

The [cluster autoscaler profile](cluster-autoscaler#cluster-autoscaler-profile-settings) is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler. You can configure the cluster autoscaler profile when you create a cluster or update an existing cluster.

### Optimizing the cluster autoscaler profile

You should fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile settings according to your specific workload scenarios while also considering tradeoffs between performance and cost. This section provides examples that demonstrate those tradeoffs.

It's important to note that the cluster autoscaler profile settings are cluster-wide and applied to all autoscale-enabled node pools. Any scaling actions that take place in one node pool can affect the autoscaling behavior of other node pools, which can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you apply consistent and synchronized profile configurations across all relevant node pools to ensure you get your desired results.

#### Example 1: Optimizing for performance

For clusters that handle substantial and bursty workloads with a primary focus on performance, we recommend increasing the `scan-interval`

and decreasing the `scale-down-utilization-threshold`

. These settings help batch multiple scaling operations into a single call, optimizing scaling time and the utilization of compute read/write quotas. It also helps mitigate the risk of swift scale down operations on underutilized nodes, enhancing the pod scheduling efficiency. Also increase `ok-total-unready-count`

and `max-total-unready-percentage`

.

For clusters with daemonset pods, we recommend setting `ignore-daemonsets-utilization`

to `true`

, which effectively ignores node utilization by daemonset pods and minimizes unnecessary scale down operations. See [profile for bursty workloads](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-bursty-workloads)

#### Example 2: Optimizing for cost

If you want a [cost-optimized profile](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down), we recommend setting the following parameter configurations:

- Reduce
`scale-down-unneeded-time`

, which is the amount of time a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. - Reduce
`scale-down-delay-after-add`

, which is the amount of time to wait after a node is added before considering it for scale down. - Increase
`scale-down-utilization-threshold`

, which is the utilization threshold for removing nodes. - Increase
`max-empty-bulk-delete`

, which is the maximum number of nodes that can be deleted in a single call. - Set
`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

to false. - Increase
`ok-total-unready-count`

and`max-total-unready-percentage`

.

## Common issues and mitigation recommendations

View scaling failures and scale-up not triggered events via [CLI or Portal](cluster-autoscaler#retrieve-cluster-autoscaler-logs-and-status).

### Not triggering scale up operations

| Common causes | Mitigation recommendations |

Node pool in backoff was introduced in version 0.6.2 and causes the cluster autoscaler to back off from scaling a node pool after a failure.

Depending on how long the scaling operations have been experiencing failures, it may take up to 30 minutes before making another attempt. You can reset the node pool's backoff state by disabling and then re-enabling autoscaling.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) is a Kubernetes operator that gets key-values, Key Vault references and feature flags from Azure App Configuration and builds them into Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets. Azure App Configuration extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to install and manage Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS cluster via Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription.
[Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - Permission with the
[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)role.

### Set up the Azure CLI extension for cluster extensions

Install the `k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extension by running the following commands:

```
az extension add --name k8s-extension
```


If the `k8s-extension`

extension is already installed, you can update it to the latest version using the following command:

```
az extension update --name k8s-extension
```


### Register the `KubernetesConfiguration`

resource provider

If you haven't previously used cluster extensions, you may need to register the resource provider with your subscription. You can check the status of the provider registration using the [az provider list](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-list) command, as shown in the following example:

```
az provider list --query "[?namespace=='Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration']" -o table
```


The *Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration* provider should report as *Registered*, as shown in the following example output:

```
Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy
--------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Registered RegistrationRequired
```


If the provider shows as *NotRegistered*, register the provider using the [az provider register](/en-us/cli/azure/provider#az-provider-register) as shown in the following example:

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
```


## Install the extension on your AKS cluster

Create the Azure App Configuration extension, which installs Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider on your AKS.

For example, install the latest version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider via the Azure App Configuration extension on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration
```


Important

The Azure App Configuration AKS extension is installed into the `azappconfig-system`

namespace by default. If you have Azure Policy assignments that validate or mutate pod specifications (for example, the built-in policy "Kubernetes clusters should disable automounting API credentials" which enforces `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

), exclude the `azappconfig-system`

namespace from those policies by adding it to the policy's namespace exclusion list so the extension can function correctly. Not excluding it may cause the extension pods to fail validation or appear non-compliant.

### Configure automatic updates

If you create Azure App Configuration extension without specifying a version, `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

*is automatically enabled*, configuring the Azure App Configuration extension to automatically update its minor version on new releases.

You can disable auto update by specifying the `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

parameter and setting the value to `false`

.

### Targeting a specific version

The same command-line argument is used for installing a specific version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider or rolling back to a previous version. Set `--auto-upgrade-minor-version`

to `false`

and `--version`

to the version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider you wish to install. If the `version`

parameter is omitted, the extension installs the latest version.

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider \
--extension-type Microsoft.AppConfiguration \
--auto-upgrade-minor-version false
--version 2.1.0
```


## Extension versions

The Azure App Configuration extension supports the following version of Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider:

`2.1.0`

`2.0.0`


## Troubleshoot extension installation errors

If the extension fails to create or update, try suggestions and solutions in the [Azure App Configuration extension troubleshooting guide](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/extensions/troubleshoot-app-configuration-extension-installation-errors).

## Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

Troubleshoot Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider errors via the [troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#troubleshooting).

## Delete the extension

If you need to delete the extension and remove Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider from your AKS cluster, you can use the following command:

```
az k8s-extension delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --cluster-type managedClusters --name appconfigurationkubernetesprovider
```


## Next Steps

- Learn more about
[extra settings and preferences you can set on the Azure App Configuration extension](azure-app-configuration-settings). - Once you successfully install Azure App Configuration extension in your AKS cluster, try
[quickstart](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service)to learn how to use it. - See all the supported features of
[Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/reference-kubernetes-provider).

# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Use a service principal with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require either a [Microsoft Entra service principal](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals) or a [managed identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) to dynamically create and manage other Azure resources. This article describes how to create a Microsoft Entra service principal and use it with your AKS cluster.

Note

For optimal security and ease of use, we recommend using managed identities instead of service principals to authorize access from an AKS cluster to other resources in Azure. A managed identity is a special type of service principal that you can use to get Microsoft Entra credentials without the need to manage and secure credentials. For more information, see [Use a managed identity in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- If using Azure PowerShell, you need Azure PowerShell version 5.0.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

- You need permissions to register an application with your Microsoft Entra tenant and to assign the application to a role in your subscription. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you need to ask your Microsoft Entra ID or subscription administrator to assign the necessary permissions or create the service principal for you.

## Considerations when using a service principal

Keep the following considerations in mind when using a Microsoft Entra service principal with AKS:

- The service principal for Kubernetes is a part of the cluster configuration, but don't use this identity to deploy the cluster. Instead,
[create a service principal](#create-a-service-principal)first, then use that service principal to create the AKS cluster. - Every service principal is associated with a Microsoft Entra application. You can associate the service principal for a Kubernetes cluster with any valid Microsoft Entra application name (for example:
`https://www.contoso.org/example`

). The URL for the application doesn't have to be a real endpoint. - When you specify the service principal
**client ID**, use the value of the application ID (`appId`

for Azure CLI or`ApplicationId`

for Azure PowerShell). - On the agent node virtual machines (VMs) in the AKS cluster, the service principal credentials are stored in the
`/etc/kubernetes/azure.json`

file. - When you delete an AKS cluster that you created using the
command or the`az aks create`

cmdlet, the service principal created isn't automatically deleted. See the`New-AzAksCluster`

[steps to delete a service principal](#delete-a-service-principal). - If you're using a service principal from a different Microsoft Entra tenant, there are other considerations around the permissions available when you deploy the cluster. You might not have the appropriate permissions to read and write directory information. For more information, see
[What are the default user permissions in Microsoft Entra ID?](/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions)

## Create a service principal

Create a service principal using the

command.`az ad sp create-for-rbac`

`# Set environment variable SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=<your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`{ "appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "displayName": "myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "name": "http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal", "password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" }`

Copy the values for

`appId`

and`password`

from the output to use when creating the AKS cluster.

Create a service principal using the

command.`New-AzADServicePrincipal`

`# Set environment variable $SpName = <your-service-principal-name> # Create the service principal New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $SpName -OutVariable sp`

Your output should be similar to the following example output:

`Secret : System.Security.SecureString ServicePrincipalNames : {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, http://myAKSClusterServicePrincipal} ApplicationId : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx ObjectType : ServicePrincipal DisplayName : myAKSClusterServicePrincipal Id : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Type :`

The values are stored in a variable that you use when creating the AKS cluster.

Decrypt the value stored in the

**Secret**secure string using the following command.`$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret) [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)`


## Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--service-principal`

and`--client-secret`

parameters set to specify the`appId`

and`password`

values.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> APP_ID=<app-id> CLIENT_SECRET=<password-value> # Create the AKS cluster az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --service-principal $APP_ID \ --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Convert the service principal

`ApplicationId`

and`Secret`

to a**PSCredential**object using the following command.`$Cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($sp.ApplicationId, $sp.Secret)`

Create an AKS cluster with an existing service principal using the

cmdlet and specify the`New-AzAksCluster`

`ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret`

parameter with the**PSCredential**object as its value.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> # Create the AKS cluster New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ClusterName -ServicePrincipalIdAndSecret $Cred`


Note

If you're using an existing service principal with customized secret, make sure the secret isn't longer than 190 bytes.

## Delegate access to other Azure resources

You can use the service principal for the AKS cluster to access other resources. For example, if you want to deploy your AKS cluster into an existing Azure virtual network (VNet) subnet, connect to ACR, or access keys or secrets in a key vault from your cluster, then you need to delegate access to those resources to the service principal. To delegate access, assign an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role to the service principal.

When you assign roles, you specify the scope for the role assignment, such as a resource group or VNet resource. The role assignment determines what permissions the service principal has on the resource and at what scope.

Important

Permissions granted to a service principal associated with a cluster can take up 60 minutes to propagate.

## Create a role assignment

Note

The scope for a resource needs to be a full resource ID, such as `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup`

or `/subscriptions/\<guid\>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupVnet/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet`

.

Create a role assignment using the

command. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`az role assignment create`

`--assignee`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`--scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`az role assignment create \ --assignee <app-id> \ --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User"`


Create a role assignment using the

cmdlet. Specify the value of the service principal app ID for the`New-AzRoleAssignment`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter and the scope for the role assignment for the`-Scope`

parameter. The following example assigns the service principal permissions to access secrets in a key vault:`New-AzRoleAssignment -ApplicationId <app-id> ` -Scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault-name>" ` -RoleDefinitionName "Key Vault Secrets User"`


## Grant access to Azure Container Registry

If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR) as your container image store, you need to grant permissions to the service principal for your AKS cluster to read and pull images. We recommend following the steps in [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration) to integrate with a registry and assign the appropriate role for the service principal.

## Grant access to networking resources

If you're using advanced networking with a VNet and subnet or public IP addresses in different resource group, you can assign the [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) built-in role on the subnet within the VNet. Alternatively, you can create a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with permissions to access the network resources in that resource group. For more information, see [AKS service permissions](concepts-identity#aks-service-permissions).

## Grant access to storage disks

If you need to access existing disk resources in another resource group, assign one of the following sets of role permissions:

- Create a
[custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)and define the*Microsoft.Compute/disks/read*and*Microsoft.Compute/disks/write*role permissions. - Assign the
[Virtual Machine Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor)built-in role on the resource group.

## Grant access to Azure Container Instances

If you use virtual kubelet to integrate with AKS and run Azure Container Instances (ACI) in resource group separate from the AKS cluster, you need to assign *Contributor* permissions to the AKS cluster service principal for the ACI resource group.

## Delete a service principal

Query for the service principal client ID (

`servicePrincipalProfile.clientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecommand with the`az ad sp delete`

`--id`

parameter. The [`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group-name> CLUSTER_NAME=<your-aks-cluster-name> # Delete the service principal az ad sp delete --id $(az aks show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId \ --output tsv)`


Query for the service principal client ID (

`ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId`

) and delete the service principal using thecmdlet with the`Remove-AzADServicePrincipal`

`-ApplicationId`

parameter. The [`Get-AzAksCluster`

][get-azakscluster] cmdlet retrieves the client ID for the specified AKS cluster.`# Set environment variables $ResourceGroupName = <your-resource-group-name> $ClusterName = <your-aks-cluster-name> $ClientId = (Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster ).ServicePrincipalProfile.ClientId # Delete the service principal Remove-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $ClientId`


## Resolve service principal credential issues

Azure CLI caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

Azure PowerShell caches the service principal credentials for AKS clusters.

If these credentials expire, you might encounter errors during AKS cluster deployment. If there's an issue with the cached credentials, you might receive an error message similar to the following error message:

```
Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'.
Details: The credentials in ServicePrincipalProfile were invalid. Please see https://aka.ms/aks-sp-help for more details.
Details: adal: Refresh request failed. Status Code = '401'.
```


You can check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command with the

`"[].endDateTime"`

query. The output shows you the `endDateTime`

of your credentials.```
az ad app credential list \
--id <app-id> \
--query "[].endDateTime" \
--output tsv
```


- Check the expiration date of your service principal credentials using the
cmdlet. The output shows you the`Get-AzADAppCredential`

`EndDate`

of your credentials.

```
Get-AzADAppCredential -ApplicationId <app-id>
```


**The default expiration time for the service principal credentials is one year**. If your credentials are older than one year, you can [reset the existing credentials](update-credentials#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials) or [create a new service principal](update-credentials#create-a-new-service-principal).
