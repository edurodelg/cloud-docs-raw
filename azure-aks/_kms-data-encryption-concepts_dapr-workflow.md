Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) stores sensitive data such as Kubernetes secrets in etcd, the distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes. For enhanced security and compliance requirements, AKS supports encryption of Kubernetes secrets at rest using the Kubernetes Key Management Service (KMS) provider integrated with Azure Key Vault.

This article explains the key concepts, encryption models, and key management options available for protecting Kubernetes secrets at rest in AKS.

## Understanding data encryption at rest

Data encryption at rest protects your data when it's stored on disk. Without encryption at rest, an attacker who gains access to the underlying storage could potentially read sensitive data like Kubernetes secrets.

AKS provides encryption for Kubernetes secrets stored in etcd:

| Layer | Description |
|---|---|
Azure platform encryption |
Azure Storage automatically encrypts all data at rest using 256-bit AES encryption. This encryption is always enabled and transparent to users. |
KMS provider encryption |
An optional layer that encrypts Kubernetes secrets before they're written to etcd using keys stored in Azure Key Vault. |

For more information about Azure's encryption at rest capabilities, see [Azure data encryption at rest](/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) and [Azure encryption models](/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models).

## KMS provider for data encryption

The [Kubernetes KMS provider](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/) is a mechanism that enables encryption of Kubernetes secrets at rest using an external key management system. AKS integrates with Azure Key Vault to provide this capability, giving you control over encryption keys while maintaining the security benefits of a managed Kubernetes service.

### How KMS encryption works

When you enable KMS for an AKS cluster:

**Secret creation**: When a secret is created, the Kubernetes API server sends the secret data to the KMS provider plugin.**Encryption**: The KMS plugin encrypts the secret data using a Data Encryption Key (DEK), which is itself encrypted using a Key Encryption Key (KEK) stored in Azure Key Vault.**Storage**: The encrypted secret is stored in etcd.**Secret retrieval**: When a secret is read, the KMS plugin decrypts the DEK using the KEK from Azure Key Vault, then uses the DEK to decrypt the secret data.

This envelope encryption approach provides both security and performance benefits. The DEK handles frequent encryption operations locally while the KEK in Azure Key Vault provides the security of a hardware-backed key management system.

## Key management options

AKS offers two key management options for KMS encryption:

### Platform-managed keys (PMK)

With platform-managed keys, AKS automatically manages the encryption keys for you:

- AKS creates and manages the encryption keys.
- Key rotation is handled automatically by the platform.
- No additional configuration or key vault setup is required.

**When to use platform-managed keys:**

- You want the simplest setup with minimal configuration.
- You don't have specific regulatory requirements that mandate customer-managed keys.
- You want automatic key rotation without manual intervention.

### Customer-managed keys (CMK)

With customer-managed keys, you have full control over the encryption keys:

- You create and manage your own Azure Key Vault and encryption keys.
- You control key rotation schedules and policies.

**When to use customer-managed keys:**

- You have regulatory or compliance requirements that mandate customer-managed keys.
- You need to control the key lifecycle, including rotation schedules and key versions.
- You require audit logs for all key operations.

### Key vault network access options

When using customer-managed keys, you can configure the network access for your Azure Key Vault:

| Network access | Description | Use case |
|---|---|---|
Public |
Key vault is accessible over the public internet with authentication. | Development environments, simpler setup |
Private |
Key vault has public network access disabled. AKS accesses the key vault through the

- The new
[KMS encryption with platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation](kms-data-encryption)experience requires**Kubernetes version 1.33 or later**. - The new
[KMS encryption with platform-managed keys or customer-managed keys with automatic key rotation](kms-data-encryption)experience is only supported on AKS clusters where[managed identity is used for the cluster's identity](use-managed-identity).

## Limitations

**No downgrade**: After enabling the new KMS encryption experience, you can't disable the feature.**Key deletion**: Deleting the encryption key or key vault makes your secrets unrecoverable.**Private endpoint access**: Key vault access using[private link/endpoint](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/private-link-service)isn't yet supported. For private key vaults, use the[trusted services firewall exception](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/network-security#key-vault-firewall-enabled-trusted-services-only).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

With Dapr Workflow, you can easily orchestrate messaging, state management, and failure-handling logic across various microservices. Dapr Workflow can help you create long-running, fault-tolerant, and stateful applications.

In this guide, you use the [provided order processing workflow example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dapr-workflows-aks-sample) to:

- Create an Azure Container Registry and an AKS cluster for this sample.
- Install the Dapr extension on your AKS cluster.
- Deploy the sample application to AKS.
- Start and query workflow instances using HTTP API calls.

The workflow example is an ASP.NET Core project with:

- A
that contains the setup of the app, including the registration of the workflow and workflow activities.`Program.cs`

file - Workflow definitions found in the
.`Workflows`

directory - Workflow activity definitions found in the
.`Activities`

directory

## Prerequisites

- An
[Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)with Owner or Admin role. [An Azure Kubernetes Service Role-Based Access Control Admin role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)- The latest version of the
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) - The latest version of
[Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/) - Latest
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Latest
[Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Set up the environment

### Clone the sample project

Clone the example workflow application.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dapr-workflows-aks-sample.git
```


Navigate to the sample's root directory.

```
cd dapr-workflows-aks-sample
```


### Create a Kubernetes cluster

Create a resource group to hold the AKS cluster.

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```


Create an AKS cluster.

```
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 2 --generate-ssh-keys
```


[Make sure kubectl is installed and pointed to your AKS cluster.](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#connect-to-cluster-using-kubectl) If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed.For more information, see the [Deploy an AKS cluster](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster) tutorial.

## Deploy the application to AKS

### Install Dapr on your AKS cluster

Install the Dapr extension on your AKS cluster. Before you start, make sure you have:

[Installed or updated the](dapr#add-the-azure-cli-extension-for-cluster-extensions).`k8s-extension`

[Registered the](dapr#register-the-kubernetesconfiguration-resource-provider)`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

service provider

```
az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --name dapr --extension-type Microsoft.Dapr
```


After a few minutes, you'll see output showing the Dapr connection to your AKS cluster. Next, initialize Dapr on your cluster.

```
dapr init -k
```


Verify Dapr is installed:

```
kubectl get pods -A
```


### Deploy the Redis Actor state store component

Navigate to the `Deploy`

directory in your forked version of the sample:

```
cd Deploy
```


Deploy the Redis component:

```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install redis bitnami/redis
kubectl apply -f redis.yaml
```


### Run the application

Once Redis is deployed, deploy the application to AKS:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```


Expose the Dapr sidecar and the sample app:

```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
export APP_URL=$(kubectl get svc/workflows-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export DAPR_URL=$(kubectl get svc/workflows-sample-dapr -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```


Verify that the above commands were exported:

```
echo $APP_URL
echo $DAPR_URL
```


## Start the workflow

Now that the application and Dapr are deployed to the AKS cluster, you can now start and query workflow instances. Restock items in the inventory using the following API call to the sample app:

```
curl -X GET $APP_URL/stock/restock
```


Start the workflow:

```
curl -i -X POST $DAPR_URL/v1.0/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/start \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "dapr-app-id: dwf-app" \
-d '{"Name": "Paperclips", "TotalCost": 99.95, "Quantity": 1}'
```


Expected output includes an auto-generated instance ID:

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Type: application/json
Traceparent: 00-00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000-00
Date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 15:35:00 GMT
Content-Length: 21
{"instanceID":"<generated-id>"}
```


Check the workflow status:

```
curl -i -X GET $DAPR_URL/v1.0/workflows/dapr/OrderProcessingWorkflow/<instance-id> \
-H "dapr-app-id: dwf-app"
```


Expected output:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Traceparent: 00-00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000000000-00
Date: Tue, 23 Apr 2024 15:51:02 GMT
Content-Length: 580
```


Monitor the application logs:

```
kubectl logs -l run=workflows-sample -c workflows-sample --tail=20
```


Expected output:

```
{
"instanceID":"1234",
"workflowName":"OrderProcessingWorkflow",
"createdAt":"2024-04-23T15:35:00.156714334Z",
"lastUpdatedAt":"2024-04-23T15:35:00.176459055Z",
"runtimeStatus":"COMPLETED",
"dapr.workflow.input":"{ \"input\" : {\"Name\": \"Paperclips\", \"TotalCost\": 99.95, \"Quantity\": 1}}",
"dapr.workflow.output":"{\"Processed\":true}"
}
```


Notice that the workflow status is marked as completed.
