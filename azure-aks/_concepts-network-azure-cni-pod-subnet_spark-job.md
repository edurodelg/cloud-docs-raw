Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure CNI Pod Subnet assigns IP addresses to pods from a separate subnet from your cluster Nodes. This feature is available in two modes: Dynamic IP Allocation and Static Block Allocation.

## Prerequisites

Note

When using Static Block Allocation of CIDRs, exposing an application as a Private Link Service using a Kubernetes Load Balancer Service isn't supported.

- Review the
[prerequisites](configure-azure-cni#prerequisites)for configuring basic Azure CNI networking in AKS, as the same prerequisites apply to this article. - Review the
[deployment parameters](azure-cni-overview#deployment-parameters)for configuring basic Azure CNI networking in AKS, as the same parameters apply. - AKS Engine and DIY clusters aren't supported.
- Azure CLI version
`2.37.0`

or later and the`aks-preview`

extension version`2.0.0b2`

or later. - Register the subscription-level feature flag for your subscription: 'Microsoft.ContainerService/AzureVnetScalePreview'.

## Dynamic IP allocation mode

Dynamic IP allocation helps mitigate pod IP address exhaustion issues by allocating pod IPs from a subnet that's separate from the subnet hosting the AKS cluster.

The Dynamic IP Allocation mode offers the following benefits:

**Better IP utilization**: IPs are dynamically allocated to cluster Pods from the Pod subnet. This leads to better utilization of IPs in the cluster compared to the traditional CNI solution, which does static allocation of IPs for every node.**Scalable and flexible**: Node and pod subnets can be scaled independently. A single pod subnet can be shared across multiple node pools of a cluster or across multiple AKS clusters deployed in the same VNet. You can also configure a separate pod subnet for a node pool.**High performance**: Since pods are assigned VNet IPs, they have direct connectivity to other cluster pods and resources in the VNet. The solution supports very large clusters without any degradation in performance.**Separate VNet policies for pods**: Since pods have a separate subnet, you can configure separate VNet policies for them that are different from node policies. This enables many useful scenarios, such as allowing internet connectivity only for pods and not for nodes, fixing the source IP for pod in a node pool using an Azure NAT Gateway, and using network security groups (NSGs) to filter traffic between node pools.**Kubernetes network policies**: Both the Azure Network Policies and Calico work with this mode.

### Plan IP addressing

With Dynamic IP Allocation, nodes and pods scale independently, so you can plan their address spaces separately. Since pod subnets can be configured to the granularity of a node pool, you can always add a new subnet when you add a node pool. The system pods in a cluster/node pool also receive IPs from the pod subnet, so this behavior needs to be accounted for.

IPs are allocated to nodes in batches of 16. Pod subnet IP allocation should be planned with a minimum of 16 IPs per node in the cluster, as the nodes request 16 IPs on startup and request another batch of 16 anytime there are <8 IPs unallocated in their allotment.

IP address planning for Kubernetes services and Docker Bridge remain unchanged.

## Static block allocation mode

Static block allocation helps mitigate potential pod subnet sizing and Azure address mapping limitations by assigning CIDR blocks to nodes rather than individual IPs.

The Static Block Allocation mode offers the following benefits:

**Better IP scalability**: CIDR blocks are statically allocated to the cluster nodes and are present for the lifetime of the node, as opposed to the traditional dynamic allocation of individual IPs with traditional CNI. This enables routing based on CIDR blocks and helps scale the cluster limit up to 1 million pods from the traditional 65K pods per cluster. Your Azure Virtual Network must be large enough to accommodate the scale of your cluster.**Flexibility**: Node and pod subnets can be scaled independently. A single pod subnet can be shared across multiple node pools of a cluster or across multiple AKS clusters deployed in the same VNet. You can also configure a separate pod subnet for a node pool.**High performance**: Since pods are assigned virtual network IPs, they have direct connectivity to other cluster pods and resources in the VNet.**Separate VNet policies for pods**: Since pods have a separate subnet, you can configure separate VNet policies for them that are different from node policies. This enables many useful scenarios such as allowing internet connectivity only for pods and not for nodes, fixing the source IP for pod in a node pool using an Azure NAT Gateway, and using NSGs to filter traffic between node pools.**Kubernetes network policies**: Cilium, Azure NPM, and Calico work with this solution.

### Limitations

Below are some of the limitations of using Azure CNI Static Block allocation:

- Minimum Kubernetes Version required is 1.28.
- Maximum subnet size supported is x.x.x.x/12 ~ 1 million IPs.
- Only a single mode of operation can be used per subnet. If a subnet uses Static Block allocation mode, it cannot use Dynamic IP allocation mode in a different cluster or node pool with the same subnet and vice versa.
- Only supported in new clusters or when adding node pools with a different subnet to existing clusters. Migrating or updating existing clusters or node pools is not supported.
- Across all the CIDR blocks assigned to a node in the node pool, one IP will be selected as the primary IP of the node. Thus, for network administrators selecting the
`--max-pods`

value try to use the calculation below to best serve your needs and have optimal usage of IPs in the subnet:

`max_pods = (N * 16) - 1`

where `N`

is any positive integer and `N`

> 0

### Plan IP addressing

With Static Block Allocation, nodes and pods scale independently, so you can plan their address spaces separately. Since pod subnets can be configured to the granularity of a node pool, you can always add a new subnet when you add a node pool. The system pods in a cluster/node pool also receive IPs from the pod subnet, so this behavior needs to be accounted for.

CIDR blocks of /28 (16 IPs) are allocated to nodes based on your `--max-pods`

configuration for your node pool, which defines the maximum number of pods per node. 1 IP is reserved on each node from all the available IPs on that node for internal purposes.

While planning your IPs, it's important to define your `--max-pods`

configuration using the following calculation: `max_pods_per_node = (16 * N) - 1`

, where `N`

is any positive integer greater than `0`

.

Ideal values with no IP wastage would require the max pods value to conform to the above expression.

See the following example cases:

Note

The examples assume /28 CIDR blocks (16 IPs each).

| Example case | `max_pods` |
CIDR Blocks allocated per node | Total IP available for pods | IP wastage for node |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low wastage (acceptable) | 30 | 2 | (16 * 2) - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 | 31 - 30 = 1 |
| Ideal case | 31 | 2 | (16 * 2) - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31 | 31 - 31 = 0 |
| High wastage (not recommended) | 32 | 3 | (16 * 3) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 | 47 - 32 = 15 |

IP address planning for Kubernetes services remains unchanged.

Note

Ensure your VNet has a sufficiently large and contiguous address space to support your cluster's scale.

# Add-ons, extensions, and other integrations with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides extra functionality for your clusters using add-ons and extensions. Open-source projects and third parties provide by more integrations that are commonly used with AKS. The [AKS support policy](support-policies) doesn't support the open-source and third-party integrations.

## Add-ons

Add-ons are a fully supported way to provide extra capabilities for your AKS cluster. The installation, configuration, and lifecycle of add-ons are managed on AKS. You can use the [ az aks enable-addons](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-enable-addons) command to install an add-on or manage the add-ons for your cluster.

AKS uses the following rules for applying updates to installed add-ons:

- Only an add-on's patch version can be upgraded within a Kubernetes minor version. The add-on's major/minor version isn't upgraded within the same Kubernetes minor version.
- The major/minor version of the add-on is only upgraded when moving to a later Kubernetes minor version.
- Any breaking or behavior changes to the add-on are announced well before, usually 60 days, for a GA minor version of Kubernetes on AKS.
- You can patch add-ons weekly with every new release of AKS, which is announced in the release notes. You can control AKS releases using the
[maintenance windows](planned-maintenance)and[release tracker](release-tracker).

### Exceptions

- Add-ons are upgraded to a new major/minor version (or breaking change) within a Kubernetes minor version if either the cluster's Kubernetes version or the add-on version are in preview.
- There can be unavoidable circumstances, such as CVE security patches or critical bug fixes, when you need to update an add-on within a GA minor version.

### Available add-ons

Cluster extensions build on top of certain Helm charts and provide an Azure Resource Manager-driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of different Azure capabilities on top of your Kubernetes cluster.

- For more information on the specific cluster extensions for AKS, see
[Deploy and manage cluster extensions for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-extensions?tabs=azure-cli). - For more information on available cluster extensions, see
[Currently available extensions](cluster-extensions?tabs=azure-cli#currently-available-extensions).

### Difference between extensions and add-ons

Extensions and add-ons are both supported ways to add functionality to your AKS cluster. When you install an add-on, the functionality is added as part of the AKS resource provider in the Azure API. When you install an extension, the functionality is added as part of a separate resource provider in the Azure API.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows from within GitHub.

- For more information on using GitHub Actions with Azure, see
[GitHub Actions for Azure](/en-us/azure/developer/github/github-actions). - For an example of using GitHub Actions with an AKS cluster, see
[Build, test, and deploy containers to Azure Kubernetes Service using GitHub Actions](kubernetes-action).

## Open-source and third-party integrations

There are many open-source and third-party integrations you can install on your AKS cluster. The [AKS support policy](support-policies) doesn't cover self-managed installations of the following projects. Some of these projects have managed experiences built on top of them (for example in the case of Prometheus, Grafana, and Istio). These managed experiences are noted in the 'More Details' column.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).
