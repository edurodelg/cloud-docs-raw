# Stop and start an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You may not need to continuously run your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads. For example, you may have a development cluster that you only use during business hours. This means there are times where your cluster might be idle, running nothing more than the system components. You can reduce the cluster footprint by [scaling all User node pools to 0](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0), but your

[is still required to run the system components while the cluster is running.](use-system-pools)

`System`

poolTo better optimize your costs during these periods, you can turn off, or stop, your cluster. This action stops your control plane and agent nodes, allowing you to save on all the compute costs, while maintaining all objects except standalone pods. The cluster state is stored for when you start it again, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

Caution

Stopping your cluster deallocates the control plane and releases the capacity. In regions experiencing capacity constraints, customers may be unable to start a stopped cluster. We do not recommend stopping mission critical workloads for this reason.

Note

AKS start operations will restore all objects from ETCD with the exception of standalone pods with the same names and ages. meaning that a pod's age will continue to be calculated from its original creation time. This count will keep increasing over time, regardless of whether the cluster is in a stopped state.

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### About the cluster stop/start feature

When using the cluster stop/start feature, the following conditions apply:

- This feature is only supported for Virtual Machine Scale Set backed clusters.
- You can't stop clusters which use the
[Node Autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision)feature. - The cluster state of a stopped AKS cluster is preserved for up to 12 months. If your cluster is stopped for more than 12 months, you can't recover the state. For more information, see the
[AKS support policies](support-policies). - You can only perform start or delete operations on a stopped AKS cluster. To perform other operations, like scaling or upgrading, you need to start your cluster first.
- If you provisioned PrivateEndpoints linked to private clusters, they need to be deleted and recreated again when starting a stopped AKS cluster.
- Because the stop process drains all nodes, any standalone pods (i.e. pods not managed by a Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, etc.) will be deleted.
- When you start your cluster back up, the following behavior is expected:
- The IP address of your API server may change.
- If you're using cluster autoscaler, when you start your cluster, your current node count may not be between the min and max range values you set. The cluster starts with the number of nodes it needs to run its workloads, which isn't impacted by your autoscaler settings. When your cluster performs scaling operations, the min and max values will impact your current node count, and your cluster will eventually enter and remain in that desired range until you stop your cluster.


## Stop an AKS cluster

Use the

command to stop a running AKS cluster, including the nodes and control plane. The following example stops a cluster named`az aks stop`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks stop --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has stopped using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows as`Stopped`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Stopped" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Stopping`

, your cluster hasn't fully stopped yet.

Important

If you're using [pod disruption budgets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/), the stop operation can take longer, as the drain process will take more time to complete.

## Start an AKS cluster

Caution

After utilizing the start/stop feature on AKS, it is essential to wait 15-30 minutes before restarting your AKS cluster. This waiting period is necessary because it takes several minutes for the relevant services to fully stop. Attempting to restart your cluster during this process can disrupt the shutdown process and potentially cause issues with the cluster or its workloads.

Use the

command to start a stopped AKS cluster. The cluster restarts with the previous control plane state and number of agent nodes. The following example starts a cluster named`az aks start`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks start --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has started using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows`Running`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Running" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Starting`

, your cluster hasn't fully started yet.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to enable and disable Advanced Container Networking Services, including [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability) and [Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security), on your AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - Azure CLI version 2.71.0 or higher. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Install the](#install-the-aks-preview-azure-cli-extension)version`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension`14.0.0b6`

or higher.[Register the](#register-the-advancednetworkingl7policypreview-feature-flag)in your subscription.`AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview`

feature flag- Clusters that have the Cilium data plane support
*Container Network Observability*and*Container Network Security*in Kubernetes version 1.29 and later.

## Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Install the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Register the `AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"`

Registration takes a few minutes to complete.

Verify successful registration using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingL7PolicyPreview"`


## Set environment variables

The examples in this article use the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example value |
|---|---|---|
`RESOURCE_GROUP` |
Name of the Azure resource group | `myResourceGroup` |
`LOCATION` |
Azure region for resources | `eastus` |
`CLUSTER_NAME` |
Name of the AKS cluster | `myAKSCluster` |

**All commands in this article assume these environment variables are set**. Make sure to replace the example values with your own values.

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`


## Create a new AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services

Note

When the `--acns-advanced-networkpolicies`

parameter is set to `L7`

, both Layer 7 and fully qualified domain name (FQDN) filtering policies are enabled. If you want to enable only FQDN filtering, set the parameter to `FQDN`

.

Create an AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services and Cilium using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-acns`

and`--network-dataplane cilium`

flags.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --kubernetes-version 1.29 \ --enable-acns \ --acns-advanced-networkpolicies <L7/FQDN>`


Important

The [Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security) feature isn't available for non-Cilium clusters.

Create an AKS cluster with Advanced Container Networking Services using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-acns`

flag.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --enable-acns`


## Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing AKS cluster with Cilium using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-acns`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-acns \ --acns-advanced-networkpolicies <L7/FQDN>`


Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-acns`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-acns`


## Disable Advanced Container Networking Services on an AKS cluster

Disable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-acns`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --disable-acns`


## Disable Container Network Observability on an AKS cluster

Disable the Container Network Observability feature without affecting other Advanced Container Networking Services features using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-acns-observability`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-acns \ --disable-acns-observability`


Container Network Observability is the only feature available for non-Cilium clusters, so you can disable it only by disabling the entire Advanced Container Networking Services suite.

Disable the Container Network Observability feature on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-acns`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --disable-acns`


## Disable Container Network Security on an AKS cluster

Disable the Container Network Security feature without affecting other Advanced Container Networking Services features using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-acns-security`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-acns \ --disable-acns-security`
