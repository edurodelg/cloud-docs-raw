This article provides resources you can use to better understand your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) usage and costs and identify cost optimization opportunities.

## About cost analysis

[Microsoft Cost Management](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/reporting-get-started) is a suite of FinOps tools that help you analyze, monitor, and optimize your cloud costs. It's available for Azure customers with access to a billing account, subscription, resource group, or management group. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Cost Management?](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management)

[Cost analysis](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/reporting-get-started#cost-analysis) is a feature of Cost Management that helps you understand your costs and usage. It provides insights into how your resources are being used and helps you identify opportunities to reduce costs. For more information, see [Start analyzing costs in Azure](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis).

## Cost analysis resources

### Cost analysis add-on for AKS

The cost analysis add-on for AKS allows you to view comprehensive cost data scoped to Kubernetes constructs, such as clusters and namespaces, and Azure Compute, Network, and Storage resources. Enable it on your AKS cluster by following the steps in [Enable the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost analysis add-on](cost-analysis). To learn more about viewing the cost data, see [View Kubernetes costs](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/view-kubernetes-costs).

### Azure Cost Optimization workbook

The [Azure Cost Optimization workbook](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-workbook-cost-optimization) provides a comprehensive view of your Azure costs and recommendations for optimizing them. For more information, see [Cost Optimization workbook](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-workbook-cost-optimization).

### Azure Orphaned Resources workbook

The [Azure Orphaned Resources workbook](https://github.com/dolevshor/azure-orphan-resources) helps you identify and manage unused resources in your Azure environment. For more information, see [Orphaned Resources workbook](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/fasttrackforazureblog/azure-orphan-resources/3492198).

# Deploy a fully managed resource group using node resource group lockdown in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS deploys infrastructure into your subscription for connecting to and running your applications. Changes made directly to resources in the [node resource group](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-resource-group) can affect cluster operations or cause future issues. For example, scaling, storage, or network configurations should be made through the Kubernetes API and not directly on these resources.

To prevent changes from being made to the node resource group, you can apply a deny assignment and block users from modifying resources created as part of the AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you need the following resources installed and configured:

- The Azure CLI version 2.44.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the current version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create an AKS cluster with node resource group lockdown

Create a cluster with node resource group lockdown using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level`

flag set to `ReadOnly`

. This configuration allows you to view the resources but not modify them.```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level ReadOnly \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Update an existing cluster with node resource group lockdown

Update an existing cluster with node resource group lockdown using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--nrg-lockdown-restriction-level`

flag set to `ReadOnly`

. This configuration allows you to view the resources but not modify them.```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --nrg-lockdown-restriction-level ReadOnly
```


## Remove node resource group lockdown from a cluster

Remove node resource group lockdown from an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the

`--nrg-restriction-level`

flag set to `Unrestricted`

. This configuration allows you to view and modify the resources.```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --nrg-lockdown-restriction-level Unrestricted
```
