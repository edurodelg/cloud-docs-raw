Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. The Kubernetes scheduler lets you control the distribution of compute resources, or limit the impact of maintenance events.

This best practices article focuses on basic Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Use resource quotas to provide a fixed amount of resources to teams or workloads
- Limit the impact of scheduled maintenance using pod disruption budgets

## Enforce resource quotas


Best practice guidancePlan and apply resource quotas at the namespace level. If pods don't define resource requests and limits, reject the deployment. Monitor resource usage and adjust quotas as needed.


Resource requests and limits are placed in the pod specification. Requests are used by the Kubernetes scheduler at deployment time to find an available node in the cluster. Limits and requests work at the individual pod level. For more information about how to define these values, see [Define pod resource requests and limits](developer-best-practices-resource-management#define-pod-resource-requests-and-limits).

To provide a way to reserve and limit resources across a development team or project, you should use *resource quotas*. These quotas are defined on a namespace, and can be used to set quotas on the following basis:

**Compute resources**, such as CPU and memory, or GPUs.**Storage resources**, including the total number of volumes or amount of disk space for a given storage class.**Object count**, such as maximum number of secrets, services, or jobs can be created.

Kubernetes doesn't overcommit resources. Once your cumulative resource request total passes the assigned quota, all further deployments will be unsuccessful.

When you define resource quotas, all pods created in the namespace must provide limits or requests in their pod specifications. If they don't provide these values, you can reject the deployment. Instead, you can [configure default requests and limits for a namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/).

The following example YAML manifest named *dev-app-team-quotas.yaml* sets a hard limit of a total of *10* CPUs, *20Gi* of memory, and *10* pods:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
name: dev-app-team
spec:
hard:
cpu: "10"
memory: 20Gi
pods: "10"
```


This resource quota can be applied by specifying the namespace, such as *dev-apps*:

```
kubectl apply -f dev-app-team-quotas.yaml --namespace dev-apps
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate resource quotas.

For more information about available resource objects, scopes, and priorities, see [Resource quotas in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/).

## Plan for availability using pod disruption budgets


Best practice guidanceTo maintain the availability of applications, define Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) to make sure that a minimum number of pods are available in the cluster.


There are two disruptive events that cause pods to be removed:

### Involuntary disruptions

*Involuntary disruptions* are events beyond the typical control of the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Hardware failure on the physical machine
- Kernel panic
- Deletion of a node VM

Involuntary disruptions can be mitigated by:

- Using multiple replicas of your pods in a deployment.
- Running multiple nodes in the AKS cluster.

### Voluntary disruptions

*Voluntary disruptions* are events requested by the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Cluster upgrades
- Updated deployment template
- Accidentally deleting a pod

Kubernetes provides *pod disruption budgets* for voluntary disruptions, letting you plan for how deployments or replica sets respond when a voluntary disruption event occurs. Using pod disruption budgets, cluster operators can define a minimum available or maximum unavailable resource count.

If you upgrade a cluster or update a deployment template, the Kubernetes scheduler will schedule extra pods on other nodes before allowing voluntary disruption events to continue. The scheduler waits to reboot a node until the defined number of pods are successfully scheduled on other nodes in the cluster.

Let's look at an example of a replica set with five pods that run NGINX. The pods in the replica set are assigned the label `app: nginx-frontend`

. During a voluntary disruption event, such as a cluster upgrade, you want to make sure at least three pods continue to run. The following YAML manifest for a *PodDisruptionBudget* object defines these requirements:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
minAvailable: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


You can also define a percentage, such as *60%*, which allows you to automatically compensate for the replica set scaling up the number of pods.

You can define a maximum number of unavailable instances in a replica set. Again, a percentage for the maximum unavailable pods can also be defined. The following pod disruption budget YAML manifest defines that no more than two pods in the replica set be unavailable:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
maxUnavailable: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


Once your pod disruption budget is defined, you create it in your AKS cluster as with any other Kubernetes object:

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-pdb.yaml
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate pod disruption budgets.

For more information about using pod disruption budgets, see [Specify a disruption budget for your application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/).

# Tutorial - Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this tutorial, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker`

commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) system.

Note

Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Use

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)to clone the sample application to your development environment.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git`

Change into the cloned directory.

`cd aks-store-demo`


## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [ docker-compose-quickstart YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the

[repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main)you cloned.

## Create container images and run application

You can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the

`docker compose`

command:`docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d`

View the created images using the

command.`docker images`

`docker images`

The following condensed example output shows the created images:

`REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID aks-store-demo-product-service latest 72f5cd7e6b84 aks-store-demo-order-service latest 54ad5de546f9 aks-store-demo-store-front latest 1125f85632ae ...`

View the running containers using the

command.`docker ps`

`docker ps`

The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

`CONTAINER ID IMAGE f27fe74cfd0a aks-store-demo-product-service df1eaa137885 aks-store-demo-order-service b3ce9e496e96 aks-store-demo-store-front 31df28627ffa rabbitmq:3.13.2-management-alpine`


## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. * Do not delete the container images* - you use them in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

command.`docker-compose down`

`docker compose down`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample application, created container images for the application, and then tested the application. You learned how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.
