Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Ingress in AKS is a Kubernetes resource that manages external HTTP-like traffic access to [services](concepts-network-services) within a cluster. An AKS ingress may provide services like load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. For more information about Kubernetes Ingress, see the [Kubernetes Ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Ingress controllers

When managing application traffic, Ingress controllers provide advanced capabilities by operating at layer 7. They can route HTTP traffic to different applications based on the inbound URL, allowing for more intelligent and flexible traffic distribution rules. For example, an ingress controller can direct traffic to different microservices depending on the URL path, enhancing the efficiency and organization of your services.

On the other hand, a LoadBalancer-type Service, when created, sets up an underlying Azure load balancer resource. This load balancer works at layer 4, distributing traffic to the pods in your Service on a specified port. However, layer 4 services are unaware of the actual applications and can't implement these types of complex routing rules.

Understanding the distinction between these two approaches helps in selecting the right tool for your traffic management needs.

## Compare ingress options

The following table lists the feature differences between the different ingress controller options:

| Feature | Application Routing addon | Application Gateway for Containers | Azure Service Mesh/Istio-based service mesh |
|---|---|---|---|
Ingress/Gateway controller |
NGINX ingress controller | Azure Application Gateway for Containers | Istio Ingress Gateway |
API |
Ingress API | Ingress API and Gateway API |
|

**Hosting****Scaling****Load balancing****SSL termination****mTLS****Static IP Address****Azure Key Vault stored SSL certificates****Azure DNS integration for DNS zone management**The following table lists the different scenarios where you might use each ingress controller:

| Ingress option | When to use |
|---|---|
Managed NGINX - Application Routing addon |
• In-cluster hosted, customizable, and scalable NGINX ingress controllers. • Basic load balancing and routing capabilities. • Internal and external load balancer configuration. • Static IP address configuration. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress API. |
Application Gateway for Containers |
• Azure hosted ingress gateway. • Flexible deployment strategies managed by the controller or bring your own Application Gateway for Containers. • Advanced traffic management features such as automatic retries, availability zone resiliency, mutual authentication (mTLS) to backend target, traffic splitting / weighted round robin, and autoscaling. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress and Gateway APIs. |
Istio Ingress Gateway |
• Based on Envoy, when using with Istio for a service mesh. • Advanced traffic management features such as rate limiting and circuit breaking. • Support for mTLS |

Note

Gateway API for [Istio ingress traffic](istio-deploy-ingress) is not yet supported for the Istio add-on, but is currently under active development.

## Create an Ingress resource

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing addon, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Client source IP preservation

Configure your ingress controller to preserve the client source IP on requests to containers in your AKS cluster. When your ingress controller routes a client's request to a container in your AKS cluster, the original source IP of that request is unavailable to the target container. When you enable *client source IP preservation*, the source IP for the client is available in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*.

If you're using client source IP preservation on your ingress controller, you can't use TLS pass-through. Client source IP preservation and TLS pass-through can be used with other services, such as the *LoadBalancer* type.

To learn more about client source IP preservation, see [How client source IP preservation works for LoadBalancer Services in AKS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/how-client-source-ip-preservation-works-for-loadbalancer/ba-p/3033722#:%7E:text=Enable%20Client%20source%20IP%20preservation%201%20Edit%20loadbalancer,is%20the%20same%20as%20the%20source%20IP%20%28srjumpbox%29.).

# Monitor the ingress-nginx controller metrics in the application routing add-on with Prometheus and Grafana

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The ingress-nginx controller in the application routing add-on exposes many metrics for requests, the nginx process, and the controller that can be helpful in analyzing the performance and usage of your application.

The application routing add-on exposes the Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`

on port 10254 and a private Service `nginx-metrics`

.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the
[application routing add-on enabled](/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing). - A Prometheus instance, such as Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.

## Validating the metrics endpoint

To validate the metrics are being collected, you can set up a port forward from a local port to port 10254 on the `nginx-metrics`

service.

```
kubectl port-forward -n app-routing-system service/nginx-metrics :10254
```


```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:43307 -> 10254
Forwarding from [::1]:43307 -> 10254
```


Note the local port (`43307`

in this case) and open http://localhost:43307/metrics in your browser. You should see the ingress-nginx controller metrics loading.

You can now terminate the `port-forward`

process to close the forwarding.

## Configuring Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus

Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible service that supports industry standard features such as PromQL, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus alerts. This service requires configuring the metrics addon for the Azure Monitor agent, which sends data to Prometheus. If your cluster isn't configured with the add-on, you can follow this article to configure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to send data to Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.

### Enable Service Monitor based scraping

Once your cluster is updated with the Azure Monitor agent, you need to configure the agent to enable scraping the metrics endpoint. You can [create a Pod or a Service Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-crd) to accomplish this.

The following creates a Service Monitor scrape metrics from the ingress-nginx controller deployed by the application routing add-on.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
name: nginx-monitor
namespace: app-routing-system
spec:
labelLimit: 63
labelNameLengthLimit: 511
labelValueLengthLimit: 1023
selector:
matchLabels:
app.kubernetes.io/component: ingress-controller
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: aks-app-routing-operator
app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
endpoints:
- port: prometheus
EOF
```


In a few minutes, the `ama-metrics`

pods in the `kube-system`

namespace should restart and pick up the new configuration.

## Review visualization of metrics in Azure Managed Grafana

Now that you have Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana configured, you should [access your Managed Grafana instance](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-portal#access-your-managed-grafana-instance).

There are two [official ingress-nginx dashboards](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards) dashboards that you can download and import into your Grafana instance:

- Ingress-nginx controller dashboard
- Request handling performance dashboard

### Ingress-nginx controller dashboard

This dashboard gives you visibility of request volume, connections, success rates, config reloads and configs out of sync. You can also use it to view the network IO pressure, memory and CPU use of the ingress controller. Finally, it also shows the P50, P95, and P99 percentile response times of your ingresses and their throughput.

You can download this dashboard from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards/nginx.json).

### Request handling performance dashboard

This dashboard gives you visibility into the request handling performance of the different ingress upstream destinations, which are your applications' endpoints that the ingress controller is forwarding traffic to. It shows the P50, P95 and P99 percentile of total request and upstream response times. You can also view aggregates of request errors and latency. Use this dashboard to review and improve the performance and scalability of your applications.

You can download this dashboard from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards/request-handling-performance.json).

### Importing a dashboard

To import a Grafana dashboard, expand the left menu and click on **Import** under Dashboards.

Then upload the desired dashboard file and click on **Load**.
