AKS cost recommendations in Azure Advisor follow AKS cost best practices and help you optimize your deployments to achieve cost-efficiency without compromising on reliability. Advisor analyzes your resource configuration and recommends solutions to optimize your AKS cluster.

With Advisor, you can:

- Get proactive, actionable, and personalized best practices recommendations.
- Identify opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend.
- Get recommendations with proposed actions inline.

Cost is one of five categories that Advisor recommendations can fall into. Other categories include reliability, security, performance, and operational excellence. For more information, see the
[Introduction to Azure Advisor](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

## Prerequisites

- To access Advisor recommendations you must have one of the following roles: Owner, Contributor, or Reader of a subscription, resource group, or resource.

## AKS cost recommendations

Recommendations are available for all clusters, but only the ones relevant to the cluster configuration and historical usage will be surfaced. There is no action required by the customer to enable Azure Advisor, as it is a provided by default for all Azure services out of box.

AKS cost recommendations include the following:

- Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler recommendation mode to rightsize resource requests and limits.
- Use Azure Kubernetes Service Cost Analysis.
- Fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile for rapid scale down and cost savings.

For more information, see [Cost recommendations](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-reference-cost-recommendations#azure-kubernetes-service).

### Enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler recommendation mode to rightsize resource requests and limits

Setting the correct request and limit values is difficult given the required amount of resources can vary greatly across workloads. Managing this at scale across hundreds or thousands of pods is an even greater challenge. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests and limits for your pods based on historical workload usage patterns to improve resource utilization.

If you don't want VPA to automatically adjust the values and want additional control, VPA recommendation only mode provides suggested values without making automatic changes. This enables you to review and implement suggested values manually, which can prevent potential disruptions and ensure better control over resource allocation. VPA recommendation mode is a great option to help prevent over-provisioning, a major driver of unnecessary spend.

For more information, see [Vertical pod autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](vertical-pod-autoscaler#vpa-overview).

### Use Azure Kubernetes Service cost analysis

AKS cost analysis add-on provides detailed insights into the cost of resources used by your AKS cluster. View costs broken down by Kubernetes constructs like clusters and namespaces. This feature helps you identify cost drivers, track historical trends, identify anomalies and clusters or workloads with optimization opportunities. Having cost monitoring in place is an easy way to get visibility into cluster spend and take action to achieve significant cost savings.

Note

This recommendation is only available for public cloud clusters running in Enterprise or MCA type subscriptions.

For more information, see [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost analysis](cost-analysis).

### Fine-tune the cluster autoscaler profile for rapid scale down and cost savings

The cluster autoscaler profile is a set of parameters that control the behavior of the cluster autoscaler, which automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster based on workload demand. Tuning these settings allows greater control over autoscaler behavior to optimize resource allocation for specific scenarios. A rapid scale down configuration means more aggressive node scale, which means less idle node costs.

For more information, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler#configure-cluster-autoscaler-profile-for-aggressive-scale-down).

## View the Advisor dashboard

You can view recommendations on the Advisor dashboard in Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure Advisor portal basics](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-get-started).

# Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to use virtual nodes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To rapidly scale application workloads in an AKS cluster, you can use virtual nodes. With virtual nodes, you have quick provisioning of pods, and only pay per second for their execution time. You don't need to wait for Kubernetes cluster autoscaler to deploy VM compute nodes to run more pods. Virtual nodes are only supported with Linux pods and nodes.

The virtual nodes add on for AKS is based on the open source project [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet).

This article gives you an overview of the region availability and networking requirements for using virtual nodes, and the known limitations.

## Regional availability

All regions, where ACI supports VNET SKUs, are supported for virtual nodes deployments. For more information, see [Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-region-availability).

For available CPU and memory SKUs in each region, review [Azure Container Instances Resource availability for Azure Container Instances in Azure regions - Linux container groups](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-region-availability#linux-container-groups)

## Network requirements

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and the AKS cluster. To support this communication, a virtual network subnet is created and delegated permissions are assigned. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). By default, AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet).

Pods running in Azure Container Instances (ACI) need access to the AKS API server endpoint, in order to configure networking.

## Limitations

Virtual nodes functionality is heavily dependent on ACI's feature set. In addition to the [quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quotas), the following are scenarios not supported with virtual nodes or are deployment considerations:

Using service principal to pull ACR images.

[Workaround](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/azure-aci/blob/master/README.md#private-registry)is to use[Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line).Important

Secrets built according to the Kubernetes documentation (for standard nodes) will not work with virtual nodes. A specific server format is required, as detailed in

.`ImageRegistryCredential`

- Azure Container Instances[Virtual Network Limitations](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-vnet)including VNet peering, Kubernetes network policies, and outbound traffic to the internet with network security groups.Init containers.

[Arguments](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-exec#restrictions)for exec in ACI.[DaemonSets](concepts-clusters-workloads#statefulsets-and-daemonsets)won't deploy pods to the virtual nodes.To schedule Windows Server containers to ACI, you need to manually install the open source

[Virtual Kubelet ACI](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/azure-aci)provider.Virtual nodes require AKS clusters with Azure CNI networking.

Using API server authorized ip ranges for AKS.

Volume mounting Azure Files share support

[General-purpose V2](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts)and[General-purpose V1](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts). However, virtual nodes currently don't support[Persistent Volumes](concepts-storage#persistent-volumes)and[Persistent Volume Claims](concepts-storage#persistent-volume-claims). Follow the instructions for mounting[a volume with Azure Files share as an inline volume](azure-csi-files-storage-provision#mount-file-share-as-an-inline-volume).Using IPv6 isn't supported.

Attaching managed identities to virtual node is not supported.

Virtual nodes don't support the

[Container hooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/)feature.

Virtual nodes are often one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:
