# Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with API Server VNet Integration

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configured with API Server VNet Integration projects the API server endpoint directly into a delegated subnet in the VNet where AKS is deployed. API Server VNet Integration enables network communication between the API server and the cluster nodes without requiring a private link or tunnel. The API server is available behind an internal load balancer VIP in the delegated subnet, which the nodes are configured to utilize. By using API Server VNet Integration, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains on the private network only.

## API server connectivity

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure subscription. Your cluster or node pool is in your Azure subscription. The server and the virtual machines that make up the cluster nodes can communicate with each other through the API server VIP and pod IPs that are projected into the delegated subnet.

API Server VNet Integration is supported for public or private clusters. You can add or remove public access after cluster provisioning. Unlike non-VNet integrated clusters, the agent nodes always communicate directly with the private IP address of the API server internal load balancer (ILB) IP without using DNS. All node to API server traffic is kept on private networking, and no tunnel is required for API server to node connectivity. Out-of-cluster clients needing to communicate with the API server can do so normally if public network access is enabled. If public network access is disabled, you should follow the same private DNS setup methodology as standard [private clusters](private-clusters).

## Prerequisites

- You must have Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed. You can check your version using the
`az --version`

command.

## Limitations

- API Server VNet Integration does not support
[Virtual Network Encryption](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-encryption-overview). Clusters deployed on**v3 or earlier AKS node SKUs**(which do not support VNet Encryption) are allowed but traffic will not be encrypted. Clusters deployed on**v4 or later AKS node SKUs**(which support VNet Encryption) are blocked because encrypted VNets are incompatible with API Server VNet Integration. See[AKS supported VM SKUs](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes)for details.

## Availability

- API Server VNet Integration is available in all GA public cloud regions except eastus2 and qatarcentral. We are continually working on enabling this feature in these regions and will update this page when these regions become available.

## Create an AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using managed VNet

You can configure your AKS clusters with API Server VNet Integration in managed VNet or bring-your-own VNet mode. You can create them as public clusters (with API server access available via a public IP) or private clusters (where the API server is only accessible via private VNet connectivity). You can also toggle between a public and private state without redeploying your cluster.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --location westus2 --name <resource-group>`


### Deploy a public cluster

Deploy a public AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration for managed VNet using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Deploy a private cluster

Deploy a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration for managed VNet using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using bring-your-own VNet

When using bring-your-own VNet, you must create and delegate an API server subnet to `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

, which grants the AKS service permissions to inject the API server pods and internal load balancer into that subnet. You can't use the subnet for any other workloads, but you can use it for multiple AKS clusters located in the same virtual network. The minimum supported API server subnet size is a */28*.

The cluster identity needs permissions to both the API server subnet and the node subnet. Lack of permissions at the API server subnet can cause a provisioning failure.

Warning

An AKS cluster reserves at least 9 IPs in the subnet address space. Running out of IP addresses may prevent API server scaling and cause an API server outage.

### Create a resource group

- Create a resource group using the
command.`az group create`


```
az group create --location <location> --name <resource-group>
```


### Create a virtual network

Create a virtual network using the

command.`az network vnet create`

`az network vnet create --name <vnet-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/16`

Create an API server subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <apiserver-subnet-name> \ --delegations Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters \ --address-prefixes 172.19.0.0/28`

Create a cluster subnet using the

command.`az network vnet subnet create`

`az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resource-group> \ --vnet-name <vnet-name> \ --name <cluster-subnet-name> \ --address-prefixes 172.19.1.0/24`


### Create a managed identity and give it permissions on the virtual network

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <managed-identity-name> --location <location>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the API server subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`

Assign the Network Contributor role to the cluster subnet using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --scope <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --assignee <managed-identity-client-id>`


### Deploy a public cluster

Deploy a public AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --vnet-subnet-id <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --assign-identity <managed-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Deploy a private cluster

Deploy a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --network-plugin azure \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --vnet-subnet-id <cluster-subnet-resource-id> \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id> \ --assign-identity <managed-identity-resource-id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Convert an existing AKS cluster to API Server VNet Integration

Warning

**API Server VNet Integration is a one-way, capacity-sensitive feature.**

**Manual restart required.**

After enabling API Server VNet Integration using`az aks update --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

, due to control plane resource transition, you must immediately restart the cluster for the change to take effect. This restart is not automated. Delaying the restart increases the risk of capacity becoming unavailable, which can prevent the API server from starting. The cluster restart also ensures that all nodes reliably reconnect to the new API server endpoint.**Capacity is validated, but not reserved.**

AKS validates regional capacity when you enable the feature on an existing cluster, but this validation does not reserve capacity. If the restart is delayed and capacity becomes unavailable in the meantime, the cluster may fail to start after a stop or restart. Clusters that enabled this feature before general availability (GA), or that have not yet restarted since enablement, will not undergo capacity validation.**Feature cannot be disabled.**

Once enabled, the feature is permanent. You cannot disable API Server VNet Integration.

This upgrade performs a node-image version upgrade on all node pools and restarts all workloads while they undergo a rolling image upgrade.

Warning

Converting a cluster to API Server VNet Integration results in a change of the API Server IP address, though the hostname remains the same. If the IP address of the API server has been configured in any firewalls or network security group rules, those rules may need to be updated.

Update your cluster to API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration \ --apiserver-subnet-id <apiserver-subnet-resource-id>`


## Enable or disable private cluster mode on an existing cluster with API Server VNet Integration

AKS clusters configured with API Server VNet Integration can have public network access/private cluster mode enabled or disabled without redeploying the cluster. The API server hostname doesn't change, but public DNS entries are modified or removed if necessary.

Note

`--disable-private-cluster`

is currently in preview. For more information, see [Reference and support levels](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-types-and-status).

### Enable private cluster mode

Enable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --enable-private-cluster`


### Disable private cluster mode

Disable private cluster mode using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-private-cluster`

flag.`az aks update --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --disable-private-cluster`


## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name>`


## Expose the API server through Private Link

You can expose the API server endpoint of a private cluster with API Server VNet Integration using Azure Private Link. The following steps show how to create a Private Link Service (PLS) in the cluster VNet and connect to it from another VNet or subscription using a Private Endpoint.

### Create an API Server VNet Integration Private cluster

Create a private AKS cluster with API Server VNet Integration using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-api-server-vnet-integration`

and`--enable-private-cluster`

flags.`az aks create --name <cluster-name> \ --resource-group <resource-group> \ --location <location> \ --enable-private-cluster \ --enable-apiserver-vnet-integration`


For more guidance on how to set up Private Link with API Server VNet Integration, see [Private Link with API Server VNet Integration](private-apiserver-vnet-integration-cluster).

## NSG security rules

All traffic within the VNet is allowed by default. But if you have added NSG rules to restrict traffic between different subnets, ensure that the NSG security rules permit the following types of communication:

| Destination | Source | Protocol | Port | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Cluster Subnet | TCP | 443 and 4443 | Required to enable communication between Nodes and the API server. |
| APIServer Subnet CIDR | Azure Load Balancer | TCP | 9988 | Required to enable communication between Azure Load Balancer and the API server. You can also enable all communications between the Azure Load Balancer and the API Server Subnet CIDR. |

# Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create extension instances in an AKS cluster, setting required and optional parameters including options related to updates and configurations. You can also view, list, update, and delete extension instances.

Before you begin, read about [cluster extensions](cluster-extensions).

Note

The examples provided in this article are not complete, and are only meant to showcase functionality. For a comprehensive list of commands and their parameters, see the [az k8s-extension CLI reference](/en-us/cli/azure/k8s-extension).

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).The

`Microsoft.ContainerService`

and`Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`

resource providers must be registered on your subscription. To register these providers, run the following command:`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --wait az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration --wait`

An AKS cluster. This cluster must have been created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions won't work with service principal-based clusters. For new clusters created with

`az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters, switch to manage identity by running`az aks update`

with the`--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see[Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version >= 2.16.0 installed. We recommend using the latest version.The latest version of the

`k8s-extension`

Azure CLI extensions. Install the extension by running the following command:`az extension add --name k8s-extension`

If the extension is already installed, make sure you're running the latest version by using the following command:

`az extension update --name k8s-extension`


## Create extension instance

Create a new extension instance with `k8s-extension create`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters. This example command creates an Azure Machine Learning extension instance on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name azureml --extension-type Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --configuration-settings enableInference=True allowInsecureConnections=True inferenceRouterServiceType=LoadBalancer
```


This example command creates a sample Kubernetes application (published on Marketplace) on your AKS cluster:

```
az k8s-extension create --name voteapp --extension-type Contoso.AzureVoteKubernetesAppTest --scope cluster --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters --plan-name testPlanID --plan-product testOfferID --plan-publisher testPublisherID --configuration-settings title=VoteAnimal value1=Cats value2=Dogs
```


Note

The Cluster Extensions service is unable to retain sensitive information for more than 48 hours. If the cluster extension agents don't have network connectivity for more than 48 hours and can't determine whether to create an extension on the cluster, then the extension transitions to `Failed`

state. Once in `Failed`

state, you'll need to run `k8s-extension create`

again to create a fresh extension instance.

### Required parameters

| Parameter name | Description |
|---|---|
`--name` |
Name of the extension instance |

Version of the extension to be installed (specific version to pin the extension instance to). Must not be supplied if auto-upgrade-minor-version is set to `true` . |
`--configuration-settings` |
Settings that can be passed into the extension to control its functionality. Only the settings that require an update need to be provided. The provided settings would be replaced with the provided values. Pass values as space separated `key=value` pairs after the parameter name. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings-file` can't be used in the same command. |
`--configuration-settings-file` |
Path to the JSON file having key value pairs to be used for passing in configuration settings to the extension. If this parameter is used in the command, then `--configuration-settings` can't be used in the same command. |

## Delete extension instance

To delete an extension instance on a cluster, use `k8s-extension-delete`

, passing in values for the mandatory parameters.

```
az k8s-extension delete --name azureml --cluster-name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --cluster-type managedClusters
```


Note

The Azure resource representing this extension gets deleted immediately. The Helm release on the cluster associated with this extension is only deleted when the agents running on the Kubernetes cluster have network connectivity and can reach out to Azure services again to fetch the desired state.
