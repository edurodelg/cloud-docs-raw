Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to configure container network metrics filtering for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Cilium to optimize data collection, reduce storage costs, and focus on the metrics most relevant to your monitoring needs.

Configure container network metrics filtering enables dynamic management of Hubble metrics cardinality through Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This feature allows you to dynamically control the cardinality, dimensions, and targets of Hubble metrics without restarting Cilium agents or Prometheus servers.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


The minimum version of the Azure CLI required to complete the steps in this article is

**2.73.0**. To find your version, run`az --version`

in the Azure CLI. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).An AKS cluster with Cilium data plane and

[Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview)enabled.Kubernetes version 1.32 or later.

Container network metrics filtering works specifically with Cilium data planes.

The minimum version of the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension to complete the steps in this article is`18.0.0b2`

.

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

Install or update the Azure CLI preview extension by using the [ az extension add](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_add) or

[command.](/en-us/cli/azure/extension#az_extension_update)

`az extension update`

```
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview
# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```


### Register the AdvancedNetworkingDynamicMetricsPreview feature flag

- First, register the AdvancedNetworkingDynamicMetricsPreview feature flag by using the
command:`az feature register`


```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingDynamicMetricsPreview"
```


- Verify successful registration by using the
command. It takes a few minutes for registration to complete.`az feature show`


```
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingDynamicMetricsPreview"
```


- When the feature shows
**Registered**, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider by using thecommand.`az provider register`


```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```


### Create a new AKS cluster with Cilium

If you already have an existing cluster, you can skip this step.

Use the `az aks create`

command with the `--enable-acns`

flag to create a new AKS cluster that has all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features include:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insight into your network traffic. To learn more, see[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more, see[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security).

```
# Set environment variables
export RESOURCE_GROUP="cnm-testing-rg"
export CLUSTER_NAME="cnm-cilium-cluster"
export LOCATION="eastus2euap" # Use canary region for preview features
# Create resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
# Create AKS cluster with Cilium and ACNS enabled
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--location $LOCATION \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--enable-acns \
--enable-managed-identity \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--kubernetes-version 1.32
```


### Get cluster credentials

Get your cluster credentials by using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_get_credentials) command:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --overwrite-existing
```


## Configure custom resources for metrics filtering

Container network metrics filtering uses the `ContainerNetworkMetric`

Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to define filtering rules. Only one CRD can exist per cluster, and changes take approximately 30 seconds to reconcile. If the CRD is not applied, all metrics will be collected.

```
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: : container-network-metric # Cluster scoped
spec:
filters:
- metric: flow
includeFilters: # List of include filters
- name: sample-filter # Filter name
from:
namespacedPod: # List of source namespace/pods. Prepend namespace with /
- sample-namespace/sample-pod
labelSelector: # Standard k8s label selector
matchLabels:
app: frontend
k8s.io/namespace: sample-namespace
matchExpressions:
- key: environment
operator: In
values:
- production
- staging
ip: # List of source IPs; can be CIDR
- "192.168.1.10"
- "10.0.0.1"
to:
namespacedPod:
- sample-namespace2/sample-pod2
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
k8s.io/namespace: sample-namespace2
matchExpressions:
- key: tier
operator: NotIn
values:
- dev
ip:
- "192.168.1.20"
- "10.0.1.1"
protocol: # List of protocols; can be tcp, udp, dns
- tcp
- udp
- dns
verdict: # List of verdicts; can be forwarded, dropped
- forwarded
- dropped
metric: dns
excludeFilters: # List of exclude filters
- name: sample-filter # Filter name
from:
namespacedPod: # List of source namespace/pods. Prepend namespace with /
- sample-namespace/sample-pod
labelSelector: # Standard k8s label selector
matchLabels:
app: frontend
k8s.io/namespace: sample-namespace
```


The following table describes the fields in the custom resource definition:

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
`filters.metric` |
String | Name of the metric you would like to apply the filter on. This is mandatory. The supported values are `dns` , `flow` , `tcp` , `drop` |
Mandatory |
`includeFilters` or `excludeFilters` |
[]filter | A list of filters that define network flows to include. Each filter specifies the source, destination, protocol, and other matching criteria. You must have at least one include or exclude filter. | Mandatory |
`filters.name` |
String | The name of the filter. | Optional |
`filters.protocol` |
[]string | The protocols to match for this filter. Valid values are `tcp` , `udp` , and `dns` . Because it's an optional parameter, if it isn't specified, logs with all protocols are included. |
Optional |
`filters.verdict` |
[]string | The verdict of the flow to match. Valid values are `forwarded` and `dropped` . Because it's an optional parameter, if it isn't specified, logs with all verdicts are included. |
Optional |
`filters.from` |
Endpoint | Specifies the source of the network flow. Can include IP addresses, label selectors, and namespace/pod pairs. | Optional |
`Endpoint.ip` |
[]string | It can be a single IP or a CIDR. | Optional |
`Endpoint.labelSelector` |
Object | A label selector is a mechanism to filter and query resources based on labels, so you can identify specific subsets of resources. A label selector can include two components: `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` . Use `matchLabels` for straightforward matching by specifying a key/value pair (for example, `{"app": "frontend"}` ). For more advanced criteria, use `matchExpressions` , where you define a label key, an operator (such as `In` , `NotIn` , `Exists` , or `DoesNotExist` ), and an optional list of values. Ensure that the conditions in both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` are met, because they're logically combined by `AND` . If no conditions are specified, the selector matches all resources. To match none, leave the selector null. Carefully define your label selector to target the correct set of resources. |
Optional |
`Endpoint.namespacedPod` |
[]string | A list of namespace and pod pairs (formatted as `namespace/pod` ) for matching the source. `name` should match the RegEx pattern `^.+$` . |
Optional |
`filters.to` |
Endpoint | Specifies the destination of the network flow. Can include IP addresses, label selectors, or namespace/pod pairs. | Optional |
`Endpoint.ip` |
[]string | It can be a single IP or a CIDR. | Optional |
`Endpoint.labelSelector` |
Object | A label selector to match resources based on their labels. | Optional |
`Endpoint.namespacedPod` |
[]string | A list of namespace and pod pairs (formatted as `namespace/pod` ) to match the destination. |
Optional |

Apply the `ContainerNetworkMetric`

custom resource to enable log collection at the cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f <crd.yaml>
```


## Clean up and reset

To clean up filtering configuration:

```
# Delete the CRD
kubectl delete ContainerNetworkMetric container-network-metric
```


## Example filtering configuration

- Create a basic filtering configuration that focuses on DNS metrics:

```
# basic-dns-filter.yaml
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: container-network-metric
spec:
filters:
- metric: dns # Supported: dns, flow, tcp, drop
excludeFilters:
- from:
namespacedPod: ["kube-system/coredns"]
```


- Configure filtering for TCP metrics with include and exclude filters:

```
# tcp-metrics-filter.yaml
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: container-network-metric
spec:
filters:
- metric: tcp
includeFilters:
- from:
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
tier: "frontend"
excludeFilters:
- to:
namespacedPod: ["kube-system/metrics-server"]
```


- Configure filtering for network flow metrics:

```
# flow-metrics-filter.yaml
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: container-network-metric
spec:
filters:
- metric: flow
includeFilters:
- from:
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
tier: "frontend"
- to:
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
tier: "backend"
excludeFilters:
- from:
namespacedPod: ["default/test"]
```


- Configure filtering for dropped packet metrics:

```
# drop-metrics-filter.yaml
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: container-network-metric
spec:
filters:
- metric: drop
excludeFilters:
- from:
namespacedPod: ["kube-system/"]
```


- Configure filtering for multiple metric types in a single CRD:

```
# multi-metrics-filter.yaml
apiVersion: acn.azure.com/v1alpha1
kind: ContainerNetworkMetric
metadata:
name: container-network-metric
spec:
filters:
- metric: dns
includeFilters:
- protocol: ["dns"]
excludeFilters:
- from:
namespacedPod: ["kube-system/*"]
- metric: tcp
includeFilters:
- protocol: ["tcp"]
- from:
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
environment: "production"
- metric: flow
excludeFilters:
- from:
namespacedPod: ["default/debug-*"]
- metric: drop
includeFilters:
- reason: ["Policy denied", "Invalid"]
```


## Best practices

Ensure you do not have conflicting include and exclude filter on the CRD.

Leverage Kubernetes label selectors for flexible filtering.

Always validate filtering configurations in development or staging

Regularly review filtered metrics to ensure important data isn't lost.

Remember that only one CRD can exist per cluster.


## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Issue**: CRD configuration not applied

**Solution**: Check that the feature flag is registered and only one CRD exists:

```
# Verify feature registration
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AdvancedNetworkingDynamicMetricsPreview"
# Check existing CRDs
kubectl get ContainerNetworkMetric
```


**Issue**: Metrics still showing after applying excludeFilters

**Solution**: Remember that preexisting metrics persist in Prometheus. You may need to wait for new metrics to be generated to see the filtering effects.

## Limitations

- This feature is specifically designed for Cilium data planes only
- Only one
`ContainerNetworkMetric`

CRD can exist per cluster - Preexisting metrics persist in Prometheus; new filtering rules apply to newly generated metrics
- Requires Kubernetes version 1.32 or later

# Set up Container Network Observability for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Azure managed Prometheus and Grafana

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to set up Container Network Observability for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Managed Prometheus and Grafana and BYO Prometheus and Grafana and to visualize the scraped metrics

You can use Container Network Observability to collect data about the network traffic of your AKS clusters. It enables a centralized platform for monitoring application and network health. Currently, metrics are stored in Prometheus and Grafana can be used to visualize them. Container Network Observability also offers the ability to enable Hubble. These capabilities are supported for both Cilium and non-Cilium clusters.

Container Network Observability is one of the features of Advanced Container Networking Services. For more information about Advanced Container Networking Services for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), see [What is Advanced Container Networking Services for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?](advanced-container-networking-services-overview)

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


- The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.56.0. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) enabled.

The `az aks create`

command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`

, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like FQDN filtering. To learn more visit[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security).

Note

Clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Observability and Container Network security starting with Kubernetes version 1.29.

```
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--location eastus \
--max-pods 250 \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--node-count 2 \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29 \
--enable-acns
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,

`--enable-acns`

, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features that includes [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-observability)and the

[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview#container-network-security)feature.

Note

Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


## Get cluster credentials

Once you have Get your cluster credentials using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Azure managed Prometheus and Grafana

Skip this Section if using BYO Prometheus and Grafana

Use the following example to install and enable Prometheus and Grafana for your AKS cluster.

### Create Azure Monitor resource

```
#Set an environment variable for the Grafana name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export AZURE_MONITOR_NAME="<azure-monitor-name>"
# Create Azure monitor resource
az resource create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--namespace microsoft.monitor \
--resource-type accounts \
--name $AZURE_MONITOR_NAME \
--location eastus \
--properties '{}'
```


### Create Azure Managed Grafana instance

Use [az grafana create](/en-us/cli/azure/grafana#az-grafana-create) to create a Grafana instance. The name of the Grafana instance must be unique.

```
# Set an environment variable for the Grafana name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export GRAFANA_NAME="<grafana-name>"
# Create Grafana instance
az grafana create \
--name $GRAFANA_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


### Place the Azure Managed Grafana and Azure Monitor resource IDs in variables

Use [az grafana show](/en-us/cli/azure/grafana#az-grafana-show) to place the Grafana resource ID in a variable. Use [az resource show](/en-us/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-show) to place the Azure Monitor resource ID in a variable. Replace **myGrafana** with the name of your Grafana instance.

```
grafanaId=$(az grafana show \
--name $GRAFANA_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--query id \
--output tsv)
azuremonitorId=$(az resource show \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $AZURE_MONITOR_NAME \
--resource-type "Microsoft.Monitor/accounts" \
--query id \
--output tsv)
```


### Link Azure Monitor and Azure Managed Grafana to the AKS cluster

Use [az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) to link the Azure Monitor and Grafana resources to your AKS cluster.

```
az aks update \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--enable-azure-monitor-metrics \
--azure-monitor-workspace-resource-id $azuremonitorId \
--grafana-resource-id $grafanaId
```


## Visualization

### Visualization using Azure Managed Grafana

Skip this step if using BYO Grafana

Note

The `hubble_flows_processed_total`

metric isn't scraped by default due to high metric cardinality in large scale clusters.
Because of this, the *Pods Flows* dashboards have panels with missing data. To enable this metric and populate the missing data, you need to modify the ama-metrics-settings-configmap. Specifically, update the default-targets-metrics-keep-list section. Follow the below steps to update the configmap:

- Get the latest ama-metrics-settings-configmap.(
[https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml)) - Locate the networkobservabilityHubble = ""
- Change it to networkobservabilityHubble = "hubble.*"
- Now the Pod flow metrics should populate.

To learn more about what minimal ingestion, see the [Minimal Ingestion Documentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration-minimal).

Make sure the Azure Monitor pods are running using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system | grep ama-`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`ama-metrics-5bc6c6d948-zkgc9 2/2 Running 0 (21h ago) 26h ama-metrics-ksm-556d86b5dc-2ndkv 1/1 Running 0 (26h ago) 26h ama-metrics-node-lbwcj 2/2 Running 0 (21h ago) 26h ama-metrics-node-rzkzn 2/2 Running 0 (21h ago) 26h ama-metrics-win-node-gqnkw 2/2 Running 0 (26h ago) 26h ama-metrics-win-node-tkrm8 2/2 Running 0 (26h ago) 26h`

We have created sample dashboards. They can be found under the

**Dashboards > Azure Managed Prometheus**folder. They have names like**"Kubernetes / Networking /**. The suite of dashboards includes:`<name>`

"**Clusters:**shows Node-level metrics for your clusters.**DNS (Cluster):**shows DNS metrics on a cluster or selection of Nodes.**DNS (Workload):**shows DNS metrics for the specified workload (for example, Pods of a DaemonSet or Deployment such as CoreDNS).**Drops (Workload):**shows drops to/from the specified workload (for example, Pods of a Deployment or DaemonSet).**Pod Flows (Namespace):**shows L4/L7 packet flows to/from the specified namespace (i.e. Pods in the Namespace).**Pod Flows (Workload):**shows L4/L7 packet flows to/from the specified workload (for example, Pods of a Deployment or DaemonSet).


### Visualization using BYO Grafana

Skip this step if using Azure managed Grafana

Add the following scrape job to your existing Prometheus configuration and restart your Prometheus server:

`- job_name: networkobservability-hubble kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: pod relabel_configs: - target_label: cluster replacement: myAKSCluster action: replace - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace, __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_k8s_app] regex: kube-system;(retina|cilium) action: keep - source_labels: [__address__] action: replace regex: ([^:]+)(?::\d+)? replacement: $1:9965 target_label: __address__ - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name] target_label: instance action: replace metric_relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__] regex: '|hubble_dns_queries_total|hubble_dns_responses_total|hubble_drop_total|hubble_tcp_flags_total' # if desired, add |hubble_flows_processed_total action: keep`

In

**Targets**of Prometheus, verify the**network-obs-pods**are present.Sign in to Grafana and import following example dashboards using the following IDs:

**Clusters:**shows Node-level metrics for your clusters. (ID:[18814](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18814-kubernetes-networking-clusters/))**DNS (Cluster):**shows DNS metrics on a cluster or selection of Nodes.(ID:[20925](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20925-kubernetes-networking-dns-cluster/))**DNS (Workload):**shows DNS metrics for the specified workload (for example, Pods of a DaemonSet or Deployment such as CoreDNS). (ID: [20926][https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20926-kubernetes-networking-dns-workload/](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20926-kubernetes-networking-dns-workload/))**Drops (Workload):**shows drops to/from the specified workload (for example, Pods of a Deployment or DaemonSet).(ID:[20927](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20927-kubernetes-networking-drops-workload/)).**Pod Flows (Namespace):**shows L4/L7 packet flows to/from the specified namespace (i.e. Pods in the Namespace). (ID:[20928](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20928-kubernetes-networking-pod-flows-namespace/))**Pod Flows (Workload):**shows L4/L7 packet flows to/from the specified workload (for example, Pods of a Deployment or DaemonSet). (ID:[20929](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20929-kubernetes-networking-pod-flows-workload/))

Note

- Depending on your Prometheus/Grafana instances' settings, some dashboard panels require specific tweaks to display all data.
- Cilium doesn't currently support DNS metrics/dashboards.

Important

This article aims to provide a simplistic understanding of how to identify OSM configurations and translate them to equivalent Istio configurations for migrating workloads from OSM to Istio. This by no means, is considered to be an exhaustive detailed guide.

This article provides practical guidance for mapping OSM policies to the [Istio](https://istio.io/) policies to help migrate your microservices deployments managed by OSM over to being managed by Istio. We utilize the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) as a base reference for current OSM users. The following walk-through deploys the Bookstore application. The same steps are followed and explain how to apply the OSM [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) traffic policies using the Istio equivalent.

If you are not using OSM and are new to Istio, start with [Istio's own Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to learn how to use the Istio service mesh for your applications. If you are currently using OSM, make sure you are familiar with the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) walk-through on how OSM configures traffic policies. The following walk-through does not duplicate the current documentation, and reference specific topics when relevant. You should be comfortable and fully aware of the bookstore application architecture before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- The OSM AKS add-on is uninstalled from your AKS cluster
- Any existing OSM Bookstore application, including namespaces, is uninstalled and deleted from your cluster
[Install the Istio AKS service mesh add-on](istio-deploy-addon)

## Modifications needed to the OSM Sample Bookstore Application

To allow for Istio to manage the OSM bookstore application, there are a couple of changes needed in the existing manifests. Those changes are with the bookstore and the mysql services.

### Bookstore Modifications

In the OSM Bookstore walk-through, the bookstore service is deployed along with another bookstore-v2 service to demonstrate how OSM provides traffic shifting. This deployed services allowed you to split the client (`bookbuyer`

) traffic between multiple service endpoints. The first new concept to understand how Istio handles what they refer to as [Traffic Shifting](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/).

OSM implementation of traffic shifting is based on the [SMI Traffic Split specification](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha4/traffic-split.md). The SMI Traffic Split specification requires the existence of multiple top-level services that are added as backends with the desired weight metric to shift client requests from one service to another. Istio accomplishes traffic shifting using a combination of a [Virtual Service](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) and a [Destination Rule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/). It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with both the concepts of a virtual service and destination rule.

Put simply, the Istio virtual service defines routing rules for clients that request the host (service name). Virtual Services allows for multiple versions of a deployment to be associated to one virtual service hostname for clients to target. Multiple deployments can be labeled for the same service, representing different versions of the application behind the same hostname. The Istio virtual service can then be configured to weight the request to a specific version of the service. The available versions of the service are configured to use the `subsets`

attribute in an Istio destination rule.

The modification made to the bookstore service and deployment for Istio removes the need to have an explicit second service to target, which the SMI Traffic Split needs. There's no need for another service account for the bookstore v2 service as well, since it's to be consolidated under the bookstore service. The original OSM [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest modification to Istio for both the bookstore v1 and v2 are shown in the below [Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts](#create-pods-services-and-service-accounts) section. We demonstrate how we do traffic splitting, known as traffic shifting later in the walk-through:

### MySql Modifications

Changes to the mysql stateful set are only needed in the service configuration. Under the service specification, OSM needed the `targetPort`

and `appProtocol`

attributes. These attributes are not needed for Istio. The following updated service for the mysqldb looks like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: mysqldb
labels:
app: mysqldb
service: mysqldb
spec:
ports:
- port: 3306
name: tcp
selector:
app: mysqldb
```


## Deploy the Modified Bookstore Application

Similar to the OSM Bookstore walk-through, we start with a new install of the bookstore application.

### Create the Namespaces

```
kubectl create namespace bookstore
kubectl create namespace bookbuyer
kubectl create namespace bookthief
kubectl create namespace bookwarehouse
```


### Add a namespace label for Istio sidecar injection

For OSM, using the command `osm namespace add <namespace>`

created the necessary annotations to the namespace for the OSM controller to add automatic sidecar injection. With Istio, you only need to just label a namespace to allow the Istio controller to be instructed to automatically inject the Envoy sidecar proxies.

```
kubectl label namespace bookstore istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookbuyer istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookthief istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookwarehouse istio-injection=enabled
```


### Deploy the Istio Virtual Service and Destination Rule for Bookstore

As mentioned earlier in the Bookstore Modification section, Istio handles traffic shifting utilizing a VirtualService weight attribute we configure later in the walk-through. We deploy the virtual service and destination rule for the bookstore service. We deploy only the bookstore version 1 even though the bookstore version 2 is deployed. The Istio virtual service is only supplying a route to the version 1 of bookstore. Different from how OSM handles traffic shifting (traffic split), OSM deployed another service for the bookstore version 2 application. OSM needed to set up traffic to be split between client requests using a TrafficSplit. When using traffic shifting with Istio, we can reference shifting traffic to multiple Kubernetes application deployments (versions) labeled for the same service.

In this walk-though, the deployment of both bookstore versions (v1 & v2) is deployed at the same time. Only the version 1 is reachable due to the virtual service configuration. There is no need to deploy another service for bookstore version 2, we enable a route to the bookstore version 2 later when we update the bookstore virtual service and provide the necessary weight attribute to do traffic shifting.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

- name: v2

version: v2
EOF
```


### Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts

We use a single manifest file that contains the modifications discussed earlier in the walk-through to deploy the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, `bookwarehouse`

, and `mysql`

applications.

kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookstore
kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookwarehouse
```


### View the Application UIs

Similar to the original OSM walk-through, if you have the OSM repo cloned you can utilize the port forwarding scripts to view the UIs of each application [here](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/#view-the-application-uis). For now, we are only concerned to view the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI.

```
cp .env.example .env
bash <<EOF
./scripts/port-forward-bookbuyer-ui.sh &
./scripts/port-forward-bookthief-ui.sh &
wait
EOF
```


In a browser, open up the following urls:

http://localhost:8080 - bookbuyer

http://localhost:8083 - bookthief

## Configure Istio's Traffic Policies

To maintain continuity with the original OSM Bookstore walk-through for the translation to Istio, we discuss [OSM's Permissive Traffic Policy Mode](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/traffic_policies/#permissive-traffic-policy-mode). OSM's permissive traffic policy mode was a concept of allowing or denying traffic in the mesh without any specific [SMI Traffic Access Control rule](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha3/traffic-access.md) deployed. The permissive traffic mode configuration existed to allow users to onboard applications into the mesh, while gaining mTLS encryption, without requiring explicit rules to allow applications in the mesh to communicate. The permissive traffic mode feature was to avoid breaking the communications of your application as soon as OSM managed it, and provide time to define your rules while ensuring that application communications was mTLS encrypted. This setting could be set to `true`

or `false`

via OSM's MeshConfig.

Istio handles mTLS enforcement differently. Different from OSM, Istio's permissive mode automatically configures sidecar proxies to use mTLS but allow the service to accept both plaintext and mTLS traffic. The equivalent to OSM's permissive mode configuration is to utilize Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

settings. `PeerAuthentication`

can be done granularly at the namespace or for the entire mesh. For more information on Istio's enforcement of mTLS, read the [Istio Mutual TLS Migration article](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/).

### Enforce Istio Strict Mode on Bookstore Namespaces

It is important to remember, just like OSM's permissive mode, Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

configuration is only related to the use of mTLS enforcement. Actual layer-7 policies, much like those used in OSM's HTTPRouteGroups, is handled using Istio's AuthorizationPolicy configurations you see later in the walk-through.

We granularly put the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, and `bookwarehouse`

namespaces in Istio's mTLS strict mode.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookthief
namespace: bookthief
spec:

---

---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookwarehouse
namespace: bookwarehouse
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
```


### Deploy Istio Access Control Policies

Similar to OSM's [SMI Traffic Target](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha2/traffic-access.md) and [SMI Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-specs/v1alpha4/traffic-specs.md) resources to define access control and routing policies for the applications to communicate, Istio accomplishes these similar fine-grain controls by using `AuthorizationPolicy`

configurations.

Let's walk through translating the bookstore TrafficTarget policy, which specifically allows the `bookbuyer`

to communicate to it, with only certain layer-7 path, headers, and methods. The following is a portion of the [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest.

```
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
destination:
kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
rules:
- kind: HTTPRouteGroup
name: bookstore-service-routes
matches:
- buy-a-book
- books-bought
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
---
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


If you notice under the TrafficTarget policy, in the spec is where you can explicitly define what source service can communicate with a destination service. We can see that we are allowing the source `bookbuyer`

to be authorized to communicate to the destination bookstore. If we translate the service-to-service authorization from an OSM `TrafficTarget`

configuration to an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

, it looks like this below:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
```


In the Istio's `AuthorizationPolicy`

, you notice how the OSM TrafficTarget policy destination service is mapped to the selector label match and the namespace the service resides in. The source service is shown under the rules section where there is a source/principles attribute that maps to the service account name for the `bookbuyer`

service.

In addition to just the source/destination configuration in the OSM TrafficTarget, OSM binds the use of an HTTPRouteGroup to further define the layer-7 authorization the source has access to. We can see in just the portion of the HTTPRouteGroup below. There are two `matches`

for the allowed source service.

```
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


There is a `match`

named `books-bought`

that allows the source to access path `/books-bought`

using a `GET`

method with host header user-agent and client-app information, and a `buy-a-book`

match that uses a regex express for a path containing `.*a-book.*new`

using a `GET`

method.

We can define these OSM HTTPRouteGroup configurations in the rules section of the Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

shown below:

```
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "bookstore"
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
- source:
namespaces: ["bookbuyer"]
to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
paths: ["*/books-bought", "*/buy-a-book/new"]
- when:
- key: request.headers[User-Agent]
values: ["*-http-client/*"]
- key: request.headers[Client-App]
values: ["bookbuyer"]
```


We can now deploy the OSM migrated traffic-access-v1.yaml manifest as understood by Istio below. There is not an `AuthorizationPolicy`

for the bookthief, so the bookthief UI should stop incrementing books from bookstore v1:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

```


### Allowing the Bookthief Application to access Bookstore

Currently there is no `AuthorizationPolicy`

that allows for the bookthief to communicate with bookstore. We can deploy the following `AuthorizationPolicy`

to allow the bookthief to communicate to the bookstore. You notice the addition for the rule for the bookstore policy that allows the bookthief authorization.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
##################################################################################################

```


The bookthief UI should now be incrementing books from bookstore v1.

## Configure Traffic Shifting between two Service Versions

To demonstrate how to balance traffic between two versions of a Kubernetes service, known as traffic shifting in Istio. As you recall in a previous section, OSM implementation of traffic shifting relied on two distinct services being deployed and adding those service names to the backend configuration of the `TrafficTarget`

policy. This deployment architecture is not needed for how Istio implements traffic shifting. With Istio, we can create multiple deployments that represent each version of the service application and shift traffic to those specific versions via the Istio `virtualservice`

configuration.

The currently deployed `virtualservice`

only has a route rule to the v1 version of the bookstore shown below:

```
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
```


We update the `virtualservice`

to shift 100% of the weight to the v2 version of the bookstore.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookstore-virtualservice
namespace: bookstore
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
weight: 0
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v2
weight: 100
EOF
```


You should now see both the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI incrementing for the `bookstore`

v2 service only. You can continue to experiment by changing the `weigth`

attribute to shift traffic between the two `bookstore`

versions.

## Summary

We hope this walk-through provided the necessary guidance on how to migrate your current OSM policies to Istio policies.

# Build and deploy data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

CLI installed and updated. Install it locally using the`az aks install-cli`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use throughout the article. Replace the placeholder values with your own values.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export LOCATION="<location>" export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>" export DNS_NAME_PREFIX="<dns-name-prefix>"`


## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group for the AKS cluster using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

,`--enable-managed-identity`

,`--enable-aad`

, and`--dns-name-prefix`

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

To start building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines, see the following articles:

# Automated deployments for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Automated Deployments streamline the process of setting up a GitHub Action or Azure DevOps Pipeline, making it easy to create a continuous deployment pipeline for your application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Once connected, every new commit automatically triggers the pipeline, delivering updates to your application seamlessly. You can either bring your own deployment files for quick pipeline creation or generate Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests to containerize and deploy non-containerized applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account or an Azure DevOps organization.
- An AKS cluster. If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - An Azure Container Registry (ACR). If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Integrate Azure Container Registry (ACR) with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](cluster-container-registry-integration). - An application to deploy.

### Connect to source code repository

Create an automated deployment workflow and authorize it to connect to the desired source code repository.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Automated deployments**>**Create**. - Under
**Repository details**, enter a name for the workflow, then select**GitHub or ADO**for your repository location. - Select
**Authorize access**to connect to the desired repository. - Choose the
**Repository**and**Branch**, and then select**Next**.

### Choose the container image configuration

To get an application ready for Kubernetes, you need to build it into a container image and store it in a container registry. You use a Dockerfile to provide instructions on how to build the container image. If your source code repository doesn't already have a Dockerfile, Automated Deployments can generate one for you. Otherwise, you can use an existing Dockerfile.

Use Automated Deployments to generate a Dockerfile for many languages and frameworks such as Go, C#, Node.js, Python, Java, Gradle, Clojure, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Swift, and Rust. The language support is built on what's available in [draft.sh](https://draft.sh).

- Select
**Auto-containerize (generate Dockerfile)**for the container configuration. - Select the
**location of where to save the generated Dockerfile**in the repository. - Select the
**application environment**from the list of supported languages and frameworks. - Enter the
**application port**. - Provide the
**Dockerfile build context**path. - Select an existing
**Azure Container Registry**or create a new one. This registry is used to store the built application image.

### Choose the Kubernetes manifest configuration

Note

The Generate Manifests option also supports advanced features like Service Connector integration, auto-generated Ingress resources, and more detailed, customizable Kubernetes manifest files.

An application running on Kubernetes consists of many Kubernetes primitive components. These components describe what container image to use, how many replicas to run, if there's a public IP required to expose the application, etc. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation][kubernetes-documentation]. If your source code repository doesn't already have the basic Kubernetes manifests to deploy, Automated Deployments can generate them for you. Otherwise, you can use a set of existing manifests. You can also choose an existing Helm chart.

If your code repository already has a Dockerfile, you can select it to be used to build the application image.

- Select
**Use existing Kubernetes manifest deployment files**for the deployment options. - Select the
**Kubernetes manifest file or folder**from your repository. - Select
**Next**.

## (Optional) Use a managed ingress and/or Service Connector

When generating Kubernetes manifests with Automated Deployments, you can optionally enable App Routing to set up an ingress controller for your application. You can also use Service Connector to create a new connection or seamlessly integrate your app with an existing Azure service backend.

App Routing provides a fully managed NGINX-based ingress controller out of the box, complete with built-in SSL/TLS encryption using certificates stored in Azure Key Vault and DNS zone management through Azure DNS. When using Automated Deployments, the expose ingress command integrates seamlessly with App Routing, making it easy to expose your application to external traffic under a secure, custom DNS name—with minimal configuration.

- Select the
**Expose ingress**box. - Choose between an
**Existing ingress controller**or a**New ingress controller**. - Choose between using a
**SSL/TLS enabled**or**Insecure**ingress controller. - (Optional) Enter
**Certificate details**if choosing a**SSL/TLS enabled**ingress controller. - Choose between using
**Azure DNS**or a**3rd party provider**. - Enter the
**Azure DNS Zone**and**Subdomain name**.

## (Optional) Add environment variables

Define environment variables for a container in Kubernetes by specifying name-value pairs. Environment variables are important as they help enable easier management of settings, secure handling of sensitive information, and flexibility across environments.

## Review configuration and deploy

Review the configuration for the application, and Kubernetes manifests, then select **Deploy**. A pull request (PR) will be generated against the repository that you selected, so don't navigate away from deployment page.

### Review and merge pull request

When the deployment succeeds, select **View pull request** to view the details of the generated pull request on your code repository.

- Review the changes under
**Files changed**and make any desired edits. - Select
**Merge pull request**to merge the changes into your code repository.

Merging the change runs the GitHub Actions workflow that builds your application into a container image, stores it in Azure Container Registry, and deploys it to the cluster.

### Check the deployed resources

After the pipeline is completed, you can review the created Kubernetes `Service`

in the Azure portal by selecting **Services and ingresses** under the **Kubernetes resources** section of the service menu.

Selecting the **External IP** should open up a new browser page with the running application.

## Delete resources

Once you're done with your cluster, use the following steps to delete it to avoid incurring Azure charges:

- In the Azure portal, navigate to
**Automated deployments** - Select
**...**on the pipeline of your choice. - Select
**Delete**.

# Stateful workload upgrade patterns

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Upgrade clusters that run databases and stateful applications without data loss by using these proven patterns.

## What this article covers

This article provides database-specific upgrade patterns for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with stateful workloads, such as:

- PostgreSQL Ferris wheel pattern for ~30-second downtime.
- Redis rolling replacement for zero-downtime cache upgrades.
- MongoDB step-down cascades for replica set safety.
- Emergency upgrade checklists for security responses.
- Validation and rollback procedures for data protection.

These patterns are best for use by database administrators for applications with persistent data and mission-critical stateful services.

For more information, see these related articles:

- To upgrade your production AKS clusters, see
[AKS production upgrade strategies](aks-production-upgrade-strategies). - To check for and apply basic upgrades to your AKS cluster, see
[Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster). - To use the scenario hub to help you choose the right AKS upgrade approach, see
[AKS upgrade scenarios: Choose your path](upgrade-scenarios-hub).

For a quick start, select a link for instructions:

[Do you need an emergency upgrade?](#emergency-upgrade-checklist)[Do you need help with a PostgreSQL cluster?](#the-ferris-wheel-pattern-postgresql)[Do you need a Redis cache rolling replace?](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)

## Choose your pattern

| Database type | Upgrade pattern | Downtime | Complexity | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL |
|

[Rolling replace](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)[Step-down cascade](#mongodb-replica-set-step-down)*(coming soon)**(coming soon)*## Emergency upgrade checklist

Do you need to upgrade now because of security issues?

Run the following commands for an immediate safety check (two minutes):

`# Verify all replicas are healthy kubectl get pods -l tier=database -o wide # Check replication lag ./scripts/check-replica-health.sh # Ensure recent backup exists kubectl get job backup-job -o jsonpath='{.status.completionTime}'`

Choose an emergency pattern (one minute):

**PostgreSQL/MySQL:**Use[Ferris wheel](#the-ferris-wheel-pattern-postgresql)(30-second downtime).**Redis/Memcached:**Use[Rolling replace](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)(zero downtime).**MongoDB/CouchDB:**Use[Step-down cascade](#mongodb-replica-set-step-down)(10-second downtime).

Run with a safety net (15-minute to 30-minute window):

- Always test rollback procedures in advance.
- Monitor application metrics during the upgrade.
- Keep the database team on standby.


## The Ferris wheel pattern: PostgreSQL

This pattern is best for 3-node PostgreSQL clusters with primary/replica setup across availability zones.

Visual pattern:

```
Initial: [PRIMARY] [REPLICA-1] [REPLICA-2]
Step 1: [PRIMARY] [REPLICA-1] [NEW-NODE] ← Add new node
Step 2: [REPLICA-1] [NEW-NODE] [REPLICA-2] ← Promote & remove old primary
Step 3: [NEW-PRIMARY] [NEW-NODE] [REPLICA-2] ← Complete rotation
```


### Quick implementation (20 minutes)

```
# 1. Add new node to cluster
kubectl scale statefulset postgres-cluster --replicas=4
# 2. Wait for new replica to sync
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-cluster-3 --timeout=300s
# 3. Promote new primary and failover (30-second downtime window)
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# 4. Update service endpoint
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"postgres-cluster","role":"primary","pod":"postgres-cluster-3"}}}'
# 5. Remove old primary node
kubectl delete pod postgres-cluster-0
```


**Detailed step-by-step guide**

#### Prerequisites validation

```
#!/bin/bash
# pre-upgrade-validation.sh
echo "=== PostgreSQL Cluster Health Check ==="
# Check replication status
kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Verify sync replication (must show 'sync' state)
SYNC_COUNT=$(kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -t -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_replication WHERE sync_state='sync';")
if [ "$SYNC_COUNT" -lt 2 ]; then
echo "ERROR: Need at least 2 synchronous replicas"
exit 1
fi
# Confirm recent backup exists
LAST_BACKUP=$(kubectl get job postgres-backup -o jsonpath='{.status.completionTime}')
echo "Last backup: $LAST_BACKUP"
# Test failover capability in staging first
echo "✅ Prerequisites validated"
```


#### Step 1: Scale up with a new node

```
# Add new node with upgraded Kubernetes version
kubectl patch statefulset postgres-cluster --patch '{
"spec": {
"replicas": 4,
"template": {
"spec": {
"nodeSelector": {
"kubernetes.io/arch": "amd64",
"aks-nodepool": "upgraded-pool"
}
}
}
}
}'
# Monitor new pod startup
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-cluster -w
# Verify new replica joins cluster
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```


#### Step 2: Run a controlled failover

```
#!/bin/bash
# controlled-failover.sh
echo "=== Starting Controlled Failover ==="
# Ensure minimal replication lag (< 0.1-second)
LAG=$(kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -t -c "SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp());")
if (( $(echo "$LAG > 0.1" | bc -l) )); then
echo "ERROR: Replication lag too high ($LAG seconds)"
exit 1
fi
# Pause application writes (use connection pool drain)
kubectl patch configmap pgbouncer-config --patch '{"data":{"pgbouncer.ini":"[databases]\napp_db = host=postgres-primary port=5432 dbname=appdb pool_mode=statement max_db_connections=0"}}'
# Wait for active transactions to complete
sleep 10
# Promote new primary (this is the 30-second downtime window)
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# Update service selector to new primary
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{
"spec": {
"selector": {
"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "postgres-cluster-3"
}
}
}'
# Resume application writes
kubectl patch configmap pgbouncer-config --patch '{"data":{"pgbouncer.ini":"[databases]\napp_db = host=postgres-primary port=5432 dbname=appdb pool_mode=statement"}}'
echo "✅ Failover completed"
```


#### Step 3: Clean up and validate

```
# Remove old primary node
kubectl delete pod postgres-cluster-0 --force
# Scale back to 3 replicas
kubectl patch statefulset postgres-cluster --patch '{"spec":{"replicas":3}}'
# Validate cluster health
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Test application connectivity
kubectl run test-db-connection --image=postgres:15 --rm -it -- psql -h postgres-primary -U app_user -d app_db -c "SELECT version();"
```


### Advanced configuration

For mission-critical databases that require a <10-second downtime:

```
# Use synchronous replication with multiple standbys
# postgresql.conf
synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 2 (standby1, standby2, standby3)'
synchronous_commit = 'remote_apply'
```


### Success validation

To validate your progress, use the following checklist:

- New primary accepts reads and writes.
- All replicas show healthy replication.
- Application reconnects automatically.
- No data loss detected.
- Backup/restore tested on new primary.

### Emergency rollback

##### For immediate issues (<2 minutes)

Redirect traffic to the previous primary:

```
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{
"spec": {
"selector": {
"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "postgres-cluster-1"
}
}
}'
```


##### For comprehensive failover recovery (5-10 minutes)

Stop writes to the current primary:

`kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -c "SELECT pg_reload_conf();"`

Redirect service to a healthy replica:

`kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name":"postgres-replica-1-0"}}}'`

Promote a replica to the new primary:

`kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-1-0 --timeout=60s`

Update connection strings:

`kubectl patch configmap postgres-config --patch '{"data":{"primary-host":"postgres-replica-1-0.postgres"}}'`

Verify that the new primary accepts writes:

`kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "CREATE TABLE upgrade_test (id serial, timestamp timestamp default now());" kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "INSERT INTO upgrade_test DEFAULT VALUES;"`


**Expected outcome:** Approximately 30-second downtime, zero data loss, and an upgraded node that runs the current version of Kubernetes.

#### Step 3: Upgrade Node1 (former primary)

```
#!/bin/bash
# upgrade-node1.sh
echo "=== Step 3: Upgrade Node1 (Former Primary) ==="
# Drain Node1 gracefully
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
# Trigger node upgrade
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Monitor upgrade progress
while kubectl get node aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}' | grep -q "False"; do
echo "Waiting for node upgrade to complete..."
sleep 30
done
echo "Node1 upgrade completed"
```


#### Step 4: Rejoin Node1 as a replica

```
#!/bin/bash
# rejoin-node1.sh
echo "=== Step 4: Rejoin Node1 as Replica ==="
# Wait for postgres pod to be scheduled on upgraded node
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-primary-0 --timeout=300s
# Reconfigure as replica pointing to new primary (Node2)
kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- bash -c "
echo 'standby_mode = on' >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf
echo 'primary_conninfo = \"host=postgres-replica-1-0.postgres port=5432\"' >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf
"
# Restart postgres to apply replica configuration
kubectl delete pod postgres-primary-0
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-primary-0 --timeout=120s
# Verify replication is working
kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication WHERE application_name='postgres-primary-0';"
echo "Node1 successfully rejoined as replica"
```


#### Step 5: Upgrade Node3 (Replica-2)

```
#!/bin/bash
# upgrade-node3.sh
echo "=== Step 5: Upgrade Node3 (Replica-2) ==="
# Similar process for Node3
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Wait for upgrade and pod readiness
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-2-0 --timeout=300s
# Verify all replicas are in sync
kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "SELECT application_name, state, sync_state FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```


#### Step 6: Final failover (Node2 → Node3)

```
#!/bin/bash
# final-failover.sh
echo "=== Step 6: Final Failover and Node2 Upgrade ==="
# Failover primary from Node2 to Node3
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name":"postgres-replica-2-0"}}}'
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# Upgrade Node2
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Rejoin Node2 as replica
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-1-0 --timeout=300s
echo "All nodes upgraded successfully. PostgreSQL cluster operational."
```


### Validation and monitoring

```
#!/bin/bash
# post-upgrade-validation.sh
echo "=== Post-Upgrade Validation ==="
# Verify cluster topology
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres -o wide
# Check all replicas are connected
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "SELECT application_name, client_addr, state FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Validate data integrity
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM upgrade_test;"
# Performance validation
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"
echo "Upgrade validation completed successfully"
```


## Redis cluster rolling replace

In this scenario, a six-node Redis cluster (three primaries and three replicas) requires zero downtime.

### Implementation

```
#!/bin/bash
# redis-cluster-upgrade.sh
echo "=== Redis Cluster Rolling Upgrade ==="
# Get cluster topology
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster nodes
# Upgrade replica nodes first (no impact to writes)
for replica in redis-1 redis-3 redis-5; do
echo "Upgrading replica: $replica"
# Remove replica from cluster temporarily
REPLICA_ID=$(kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $replica | cut -d' ' -f1)
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster forget $REPLICA_ID
# Drain and upgrade node
kubectl delete pod $replica
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod $replica --timeout=120s
# Rejoin cluster
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster meet $(kubectl get pod $replica -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}') 6379
echo "Replica $replica upgraded and rejoined"
done
# Upgrade master nodes with failover
for master in redis-0 redis-2 redis-4; do
echo "Upgrading master: $master"
# Trigger failover to replica
kubectl exec $master -- redis-cli cluster failover
# Wait for failover completion
sleep 10
# Upgrade the demoted master (now replica)
kubectl delete pod $master
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod $master --timeout=120s
echo "Master $master upgraded"
done
echo "Redis cluster upgrade completed"
```


## MongoDB replica set step-down

In this scenario, a three-member MongoDB replica set requires coordinated primary step-down.

### Implementation

```
#!/bin/bash
# MongoDB upgrade script
Echo "=== MongoDB Replica Set Upgrade ==="
# Check replica set status
kubectl exec mongo-0 --mongo --eval "rs.status()"
```

Container network logs in [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provide comprehensive, context-rich visibility into every network flow within your cluster. While metrics tell you *what* is happening in your network (such as bandwidth usage or error rates), container network logs tell you *why* by capturing the complete story of each connection—including who initiated it, what protocols were used, and whether the traffic was allowed or blocked.

These logs capture essential metadata for every network flow, including source and destination IP addresses, pod and service names, namespaces, ports, protocols, traffic direction, and policy verdicts. This deep contextual information enables you to correlate network behavior with specific workloads, troubleshoot connectivity issues, validate security policies, and perform forensic analysis.

Container network logs capture Layer 3 (IP), Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), and Layer 7 (HTTP/gRPC/Kafka) traffic, providing the detailed insights you need to monitor connectivity, troubleshoot issues, visualize network topology, enforce security policies, and ensure compliance.

Choose from two modes:

- Stored logs
- On-demand logs

## Stored logs

Stored logs mode ensures continuous log generation and collection in the AKS cluster when you enable Advanced Container Networking Services and set up custom filters. By default, log collection is disabled.

To enable log collection, you define *custom resources* to specify the types of traffic to monitor. Examples include namespaces, pods, services, and protocols. This feature remains active until you disable it.

Stored logs mode supports extended log retention and traffic filtering. For reduced storage costs and easier analysis, you can collect and retain only the logs that are relevant to you.

### How stored logs mode works

Advanced Container Networking Services uses eBPF technology with Cilium to fetch logs from nodes in your cluster. To start collecting logs, you define one or more custom resources to specify the types of traffic to monitor.

Custom resources provide fine-grained control to define and capture the traffic that is relevant to you. The Cilium agent running on each node collects network traffic that matches the criteria set in the custom resources. The logs are stored in JSON format on the host, providing a structured and accessible format for further use.

Alternatively, if the Azure Monitoring add-on is enabled, agents for Container insights collect the logs from the host, apply the default throttling limits, and send them to a Log Analytics workspace. The system aggregates and stores logs efficiently to provide visibility into network traffic for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security enforcement.

To read more about throttling and Container insights, see the [Container insights documentation](https://aka.ms/ContainerNetworkLogsDoc_CI).

### Key capabilities of stored logs mode

*Customizable filters.*You can configure logging by defining custom resources of the[ContainerNetworkLog](how-to-configure-container-network-logs#containernetworklog-crd-template)type. Use custom resources to apply granular filters by namespace, pod, service, port, protocol, verdict, or traffic direction (ingress or egress). This flexibility ensures precise data collection tailored to specific use cases. Only relevant traffic is logged, and storage is optimized for improved performance, compliance, and troubleshooting.*Log storage options.*The container network logs feature has two primary storage options: unmanaged storage and managed storage.**Unmanaged storage:**When a custom resource is applied to begin log collection, network flow logs are stored locally on the host nodes at the`/var/log/acns/hubble`

fixed mount location. This storage location is temporary because the node itself isn't a persistent storage solution. When the log files reach a size of 50 MB, they're automatically rotated and older logs are overwritten. This storage solution is suitable for real-time monitoring, but it doesn't support long-term storage or retention.For additional log management capabilities, you can integrate partner logging services like an OpenTelemetry collector. Partner integrations provide flexibility to manage logs outside the Azure ecosystem and are useful if you've already deployed a specific log management platform.

**Managed storage:**For long-term retention and advanced analytics, we recommend that you configure Azure monitoring in your AKS cluster to collect and store logs in a Log Analytics workspace. This setup ensures secure and compliant log storage. It also provides access to powerful capabilities like anomaly detection, performance tuning, and historical data analysis. You can use historical logs to identify trends, baseline behaviors, and proactively address recurring issues.For example, you can use the managed service for Prometheus to configure alerts on both metrics and logs for real-time monitoring and rapid detection of outliers.

You use the same workspace for log storage. You set up log storage space during onboarding. Both Analytics and Basic log table plans are supported for this feature. For more detailed information on table plans, see

[Azure Monitor Logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs).

*Simple visualization in Log Analytics and Grafana dashboards.*Logs and data presented in Grafana dashboards simplify complex information, facilitate data comprehension, and help you make decisions more quickly.

### Logs visualization in the Azure portal

You can visualize, query, and analyze flow logs in the Azure portal in the Log Analytics workspace for your cluster.

### Logs visualization in Grafana dashboards

Access the flow logs in an Azure Managed Grafana instance.

To simplify your analysis of logs, we provide two preconfigured Grafana dashboards:

Go to

**Azure**>**Insights**>**Containers**>**Networking**>**Flow Logs**. This dashboard shows which AKS workloads are communicating with each other, including network requests, responses, drops, and errors. Currently, as an interim step during preview, you must import Grafana dashboards by using a user ID to view the flow logs dashboard in the Azure portal.Go to

**Azure**>**Insights**>**Containers**>**Networking**>**Flow Logs (External Traffic)**. This dashboard shows which AKS workloads send and receive communications from outside an AKS cluster, including network requests, responses, drops, and errors.For more information, see

[Set up Azure Managed Grafana with Advanced Container Networking Services](how-to-configure-container-network-logs#visualization-in-grafana-dashboards).

Access the flow logs in the Azure portal via the

**Dashboards with Grafana**option.

The Azure portal dashboards have the following major components:

*A comprehensive overview of network health.*You see key metrics like total flow logs, unique requests, dropped requests, and forwarded requests for quick anomaly detection and efficient troubleshooting. The dashboard categorizes statistics by protocol and behavior, including DNS dropped requests, HTTP 2xx responses, Layer 4 request and response rates, and dropped request counts. A service dependency graph visualizes application or cluster interactions, highlighting traffic flow, bottlenecks, and dependencies for performance optimization.*Flow logs and error logs for quick analysis.*You can filter flow logs for root-cause analysis. For example, to troubleshoot Domain Name System (DNS) issues, filter error logs by the DNS protocol.Separating flow logs and error logs helps you analyze issues more quickly. You can identify and address errors without sifting through unrelated information, which improves efficiency in troubleshooting and debugging processes.

Use clear labels and timestamps for each log entry to more easily pinpoint specific events or errors in your systems or processes.

*Top namespaces, workloads, and DNS errors.*Network flow log visualization is vital for monitoring and analyzing communication in an AKS cluster. It provides insight into namespaces, workloads, port usage, and query usage. It helps you identify trends, detect bottlenecks, and diagnose issues. Spot significant network activity, view dropped requests, and assess protocol distribution (for example, TCP versus UDP). This overview section of the dashboard supports cluster health, resource optimization, and security by detecting and displaying unusual traffic patterns.

## On-demand logs

Advanced Container Networking Services offers on-demand capture of network flow logs. Get real-time visibility without prior configuration or persistent storage by using the Hubble CLI and the Hubble UI. This on-demand logs mode is available. To learn how to set up on-demand log storage, see [Configure the Hubble CLI and Hubble UI](how-to-configure-container-network-logs#configure-on-demand-logs-mode).

### Hubble CLI

The Hubble command-line interface (CLI) provides a flexible and interactive way to query, filter, and analyze flow logs directly in the terminal. You can execute real-time commands to inspect traffic flows, view packet metadata, and troubleshoot network issues without leaving your operational environment.

### Hubble UI

The Hubble web-based interface offers an intuitive and visual platform for monitoring. With features like live traffic dashboards, flow summaries, and searchable logs, you can easily track service-to-service communication, detect anomalies, and gain insights into cluster activity.

The Hubble UI tools provide real-time visibility and actionable insights for faster troubleshooting and improved network management.

### Key benefits of on-demand logs

*Faster issue resolution.*With detailed and actionable insights into network traffic, you can identify and resolve connectivity or performance issues more quickly, minimizing downtime and disruptions.*Optimized operational efficiency.*Aggregated and efficiently stored logs reduce data management overhead. Your team can focus on analysis and decision-making instead of managing large volumes of raw data.*Enhanced application reliability.*By monitoring service-to-service communication and detecting anomalies, you can proactively address potential issues and ensure a smoother and more reliable application experience.*Improved decision-making.*Visualizing network patterns in Azure Managed Grafana and applying service maps provide clear insights into your application's network behavior. This leads to improved infrastructure planning and optimization.*Cost savings.*Efficient log aggregation and customizable logging scopes reduce storage and data ingestion costs, providing a cost-effective solution for long-term network monitoring.*Streamlined compliance and security.*Persistent and comprehensive logs support audit trails, regulatory compliance, and quick identification of suspicious traffic. They help you maintain a secure and compliant environment.

## Limitations

- Container network logs in stored logs mode currently works only with the Cilium data plane.
- Layer 7 flow logs are captured only when Layer 7 policy support is enabled. For more information, see
[Configure a Layer 7 policy](how-to-apply-l7-policies). - DNS flows and metrics are captured only when a Cilium Fully Qualified Domain (FQDN) network policy is applied. For more information, see
[Configure an FQDN policy](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies). - Onboarding by using Terraform currently isn't supported.
- When Log Analytics isn't configured for log storage, container network logs are limited to a maximum of 50 MB of storage. When this limit is reached, new entries overwrite older logs.
- If the table plan is set to Basic logs, prebuilt Grafana dashboards don't work.
- The Auxiliary logs table plan isn't supported.

# Add Azure Dedicated Host to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Dedicated Host is a service that provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.

Using Azure Dedicated Hosts for nodes with your AKS cluster has the following benefits:

- Hardware isolation at the physical server level. No other VMs will be placed on your hosts. Dedicated hosts are deployed in the same data centers and share the same network and underlying storage infrastructure as other, non-isolated hosts.
- Control over maintenance events initiated by the Azure platform. While most maintenance events have little to no impact on your virtual machines, there are some sensitive workloads where each second of pause can have an impact. With dedicated hosts, you can opt in to a maintenance window to reduce the impact to your service.

## Before you begin

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Before you start, ensure that your version of the Azure CLI is 2.39.0 or later. If it's an earlier version,
[install the latest version](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate Azure Dedicated Host with Azure Kubernetes Service:

- Accelerated Networking
- An existing agent pool can't be converted from non-ADH to ADH or ADH to non-ADH.
- It isn't supported to update agent pool from host group A to host group B.
- Using ADH across subscriptions.

## Planning for ADH Capacity on AKS

Not all host SKUs are available in all regions, and availability zones. You can list host availability, and any offer restrictions before you start provisioning dedicated hosts.

```
az vm list-skus --location eastus --resource-type hostGroups/hosts -o table
```


Note

First, when using host group, the nodepool fault domain count is always the same as the host group fault domain count. In order to use cluster auto-scaling to work with ADH and AKS, please make sure your host group fault domain count and capacity is enough. Secondly, only change fault domain count from the default of 1 to any other number if you know what they are doing as a misconfiguration could lead to a unscalable configuration.

[Determine how many hosts you would need based on the expected VM Utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-host-general-purpose-skus).

Evaluate [host utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts-how-to#check-the-status-of-the-host) to determine the number of allocatable VMs by size before you deploy.

```
az vm host get-instance-view --resource-group myDHResourceGroup --host-group MyHostGroup --name MyHost
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Group to an AKS cluster

A host group is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it. When planning for high availability, there are more options. You can use one or both of the following options with your dedicated hosts:

- Span across multiple availability zones. In this case, you're required to have a host group in each of the zones you wish to use.
- Span across multiple fault domains, which are mapped to physical racks.

In either case, you need to provide the fault domain count for your host group. If you don't want to span fault domains in your group, use a fault domain count of 1.

You can also decide to use both availability zones and fault domains.

## Create a Host Group

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

For more information about the host SKUs and pricing, see [Azure Dedicated Host pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/).

Use az vm host create to create a host. If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll be asked to specify the fault domain for your host.

In this example, we'll use [az vm host group create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/host/group#az-vm-host-group-create) to create a host group using both availability zones and fault domains.

```
az vm host group create \
--name myHostGroup \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup \
--zone 1 \
--platform-fault-domain-count 1 \
--automatic-placement true
```


## Create a Dedicated Host

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll need to specify the fault domain for your host.

```
az vm host create \
--host-group myHostGroup \
--name myHost \
--sku DSv3-Type1 \
--platform-fault-domain 1 \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup
```


## Use a user-assigned Identity

Important

A user-assigned Identity with "contributor" role on the Resource Group of the Host Group is required.

First, create a Managed Identity

```
az identity create --resource-group <Resource Group> --name <Managed Identity name>
```


Assign Managed Identity

```
az role assignment create --assignee <id> --role "Contributor" --scope <Resource id>
```


## Create an AKS cluster using the Host Group

Create an AKS cluster, and add the Host Group you just configured.

```
az aks create \
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name MyManagedCluster \
--location eastus \
--nodepool-name agentpool1 \
--node-count 1 \
--host-group-id <id> \
--node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 \
--assign-identity <id> \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Node Pool to an existing AKS cluster

Add a Host Group to an already existing AKS cluster.

```
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup --node-count 1 --host-group-id <id> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3
```


## Remove a Dedicated Host Node Pool from an AKS cluster

```
az aks nodepool delete --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create an AKS cluster with a Dedicated host, and to add a dedicated host to an existing cluster. For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see [dedicated-hosts](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts).

# Set up the Azure Kubernetes Service communication manager

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) communication manager streamlines notifications for all your AKS maintenance tasks by using Azure Resource Notifications and Azure Resource Graph frameworks. The communication manager gives you timely alerts on event triggers and outcomes, so that you can closely monitor your upgrades.

If maintenance fails, the communication manager notifies you with the reasons for the failure. This information reduces operational hassles related to observability and follow-ups.

By following the steps in this article, you can set up notifications for all types of automatic upgrades that use maintenance windows.

## Prerequisites

Configure your cluster for either the

[automatic upgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster)or the[automatic upgrade channel for nodes](auto-upgrade-node-os-image).Create a

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)for your configuration of automatic upgrades.

## Set up the communication manager

In the Azure portal, go to the resource.

Select

**Monitoring**>**Alerts**>**Alert Rules**, and then select**Create**.On the

**Condition**tab, for**Signal name**, select**Custom log search**.In the

**Search query**box, paste one of the following custom queries. Be sure to update the`where id contains`

path to reference your resources for subscription ID, resource group name, and cluster name.The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for clusters:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "K8sVersionUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for NodeOS:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "NodeOSUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

Go to the

**Condition**tab. Configure the alert conditions with the following settings:**Measure**: Select**Table rows**.**Aggregation type**: Select**Count**.**Aggregation granularity**: Select**30 minutes**.**Threshold value**: Keep at**0**.**Split by dimensions**: For**Dimension name**, select**status**. Then select the**Include all future values**checkbox.

In the

**Split by dimensions**area, for**Dimension values**, select a value. Because you selected**status**for the dimension name, the available values are**Scheduled**,**Started**,**Completed**,**Canceled**, and**Failed**.Note

These status values appear only if your cluster previously executed automatic upgrade operations. For new clusters or for clusters that haven't undergone automatic upgrades yet, the dropdown list might appear empty or show no available dimensions. After your cluster performs its first automatic upgrade, these status values become available for selection.

Go to the

**Actions**tab. Make sure that an action group with the correct email address exists, so that you can receive the notifications:Select

**Use action groups**>**Create an action group**.For

**Notification type**, select**Email/SMS_message/Push/Voice**.Select the

**Email**checkbox, and then enter the email address in the**Email**box.

Go to the

**Details**tab. Assign a managed identity so that you can grant access to the necessary resources. In the**Identity**area, select**System assigned managed identity**.Go to the

**Review + create**tab, and then select**Create**.Now that you've created the alert rule, you can assign the appropriate roles for the managed identity:

- In the alert rule, go to
**Settings**>**Identity**>**System assigned managed identity**>**Azure role assignments**. - Select
**Add role assignment**, select the**Reader**role, and assign it to the resource group. - Select
**Add role assignment**again, select the**Reader**role, and assign it to the subscription.

Tip

If you don't see the

**Identity**option, make sure that you created your alert rule and that you have the necessary permissions.- In the alert rule, go to

After you set up the communication manager, it sends advance notices one week before maintenance starts and one day before maintenance starts. It also sends you timely alerts during the maintenance operation.

## Verify the configuration

To upgrade the cluster, wait for the automatic upgrader to start. Then verify that you promptly receive notices on the email address that you configured to receive notices.

Check the Azure Resource Graph database for the scheduled notification record. Each scheduled event notification should be listed as one record in the `ContainerServiceEventResources`

table.

# Security concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Container security protects the entire end-to-end pipeline from build to the application workloads running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

The Secure Supply Chain includes the build environment and registry.

Kubernetes includes security components, such as *pod security standards* and *Secrets*. Azure includes components like Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Containers, Azure Policy, Azure Key Vault, network security groups, and orchestrated cluster upgrades. AKS combines these security components to:

- Provide a complete authentication and authorization story.
- Apply AKS Built-in Azure Policy to secure your applications.
- End-to-End insight from build through your application with Microsoft Defender for Containers.
- Keep your AKS cluster running the latest OS security updates and Kubernetes releases.
- Provide secure pod traffic and access to sensitive credentials.

This article introduces the core concepts that secure your applications in AKS.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Build Security

As the entry point for the Supply Chain, it's important to conduct static analysis of image builds before they're promoted down the pipeline. This includes vulnerability and compliance assessment. It's not about failing a build because it has a vulnerability, as that breaks development. It's about looking at the **Vendor Status** to segment based on vulnerabilities that are actionable by the development teams. Also use **Grace Periods** to allow developers time to remediate identified issues.

## Registry Security

Assessing the vulnerability state of the image in the Registry detects drift and also catches images that didn't come from your build environment. Use [Notary V2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) to attach signatures to your images to ensure deployments are coming from a trusted location.

## Cluster security

In AKS, the Kubernetes master components are part of the managed service provided, managed, and maintained by Microsoft. Each AKS cluster has its own single-tenanted, dedicated Kubernetes master to provide the API Server, Scheduler, etc. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-vulnerability-management).

By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can limit access to the API server endpoint using [authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges). You can also create a fully [private cluster](private-clusters) to limit API server access to your virtual network.

You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) and Azure RBAC. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra integration with AKS](managed-azure-ad).

## Node security

AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines (VMs) that you manage and maintain.

- Linux nodes run optimized versions of Ubuntu or Azure Linux.
- Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server release using the
`containerd`

container runtime.

When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.

Note

AKS clusters running:

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher - Linux node pools use
`containerd`

as its container runtime. Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 node pools use`containerd`

as its container runtime. For more information, see[Add a Windows Server node pool with](create-node-pools).`containerd`

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and earlier - Linux node pools use Docker as its container runtime.

For more information about the security upgrade process for Linux and Windows worker nodes, see [Security patching nodes](concepts-vulnerability-management#worker-nodes).

AKS clusters running Azure Generation 2 VMs include support for [Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch). This feature protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques by combining technologies that you can enable independently, like secure boot and a virtualized version of the trusted platform module (vTPM). Administrators can deploy AKS worker nodes with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and drivers to ensure integrity of the entire boot chain of the underlying VM.

### Container and security optimized OS options

AKS released support for two new optimized Linux OS options. [Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/azure-linux-os-guard) is Microsoft-created and optimized for Azure. OS Guard is built on top of Azure Linux with specialized configuration to support containerized workloads with security optimizations. [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/flatcar) is a CNCF-based vendor-neutral container-optimized immutable OS, best suited for running on multicloud and on-premises environments. These OS options provide increased security when compared to other Linux OS options, such as:

- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS have an immutable operating system that you can't modify at runtime. All OS binaries, libraries and static configuration are read-only, and the bit-for-bit integrity is often cryptographically protected. These special purpose operating systems ship as self-contained images and come without any kind of package management or other traditional means of altering the OS. User workloads run in isolated environments like containers, sandboxed from the OS.
- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS use SELinux for Mandatory Access Control.
- Azure Linux OS Guard enforces
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch)enablement, providing improved compliance and protection against advanced and persistent attacks by combining secure boot and virtualized version of trusted platform module (vTPM).

When deciding between which container-optimized OS options to use, AKS recommends the following:

- Use
if you're looking for a vendor neutral immutable OS with cross-cloud support.**Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)** - Use
if you're looking for an enterprise-ready immutable OS, recommended by Microsoft.**Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)** - Use
[Ubuntu](https://aka.ms/aks/supported-ubuntu-versions)if you're looking for a vendor neutral, general purpose OS with cross-cloud support. - Use
[Azure Linux](https://aka.ms/aks/use-azure-linux)if you're looking for an enterprise-ready, general purpose OS, recommended by Microsoft.


### Node authorization

Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode that specifically authorizes kubelet API requests to protect against East-West attacks. Node authorization is enabled by default on AKS 1.24 + clusters.

### Node deployment

Nodes are deployed onto a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, SSH is enabled by default and only accessible using the internal IP address. Disabling SSH during cluster and node pool creation, or for an existing cluster or node pool, is in preview. See [Manage SSH access](manage-ssh-node-access) for more information.

### Node storage

To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, Azure Managed Disks are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, Azure Managed Disks are securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.

### Hostile multitenant workloads

Currently, Kubernetes environments aren't safe for hostile multitenant usage. Extra security features, like *Pod Security Policies* or Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multitenant workloads, only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node.

For these types of hostile multitenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters. For more information on ways to isolate workloads, see [Best practices for cluster isolation in AKS](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

### Compute isolation

Because of compliance or regulatory requirements, certain workloads may require a high degree of isolation from other customer workloads. For these workloads, Azure provides:

[Kernel isolated containers](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-containers)to use as the agent nodes in an AKS cluster. These containers are completely isolated to a specific hardware type and isolated from the Azure Host fabric, the host operating system, and the hypervisor. They're dedicated to a single customer. Select[one of the isolated VMs sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/isolation)as the**node size**when creating an AKS cluster or adding a node pool.[Confidential Containers](confidential-containers-overview)(preview), also based on Kata Confidential Containers, encrypts container memory and prevents data in memory during computation from being in clear text, readable format, and tampering. It helps isolate your containers from other container groups/pods, and VM node OS kernel. Confidential Containers (preview) uses hardware based memory encryption (SEV-SNP).[Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing)(preview) provides an isolation boundary between the container application and the shared kernel and compute resources (CPU, memory, and network) of the container host.

## Network security

For connectivity and security with on-premises networks, you can deploy your AKS cluster into existing Azure virtual network subnets. These virtual networks connect back to your on-premises network using Azure Site-to-Site VPN or Express Route. Define Kubernetes ingress controllers with private, internal IP addresses to limit services access to the internal network connection.

### Azure network security groups

To filter virtual network traffic flow, Azure uses network security group rules. These rules define the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols allowed or denied access to resources. Default rules are created to allow TLS traffic to the Kubernetes API server. You create services with load balancers, port mappings, or ingress routes. AKS automatically modifies the network security group for traffic flow.

If you provide your own subnet for your AKS cluster (whether using Azure CNI or Kubenet), **do not** modify the NIC-level network security group managed by AKS. Instead, create more subnet-level network security groups to modify the flow of traffic. Make sure they don't interfere with necessary traffic managing the cluster, such as load balancer access, communication with the control plane, or [egress](limit-egress-traffic).

### Kubernetes network policy

To limit network traffic between pods in your cluster, AKS offers support for [Kubernetes network policies](use-network-policies). With network policies, you can allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors.

## Application Security

To protect pods running on AKS, consider [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction) to detect and restrict cyber attacks against your applications running in your pods. Run continual scanning to detect drift in the vulnerability state of your application and implement a "blue/green/canary" process to patch and replace the vulnerable images.

## Secure container access to resources

In the same way that you should grant users or groups the minimum privileges required, you should also limit containers to only necessary actions and processes. To minimize the risk of attack, avoid configuring applications and containers that require escalated privileges or root access. Built-in Linux security features such as *AppArmor* and *seccomp* are recommended as [best practices](/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security) to [secure container access to resources][secure-container-access].

## Kubernetes Secrets

With a Kubernetes *Secret*, you inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys.

- Create a Secret using the Kubernetes API.
- Define your pod or deployment and request a specific Secret.
- Secrets are only provided to nodes with a scheduled pod that requires them.
- The Secret is stored in
*tmpfs*, not written to disk.

- When you delete the last pod on a node requiring a Secret, the Secret is deleted from the node's
*tmpfs*.- Secrets are stored within a given namespace and are only accessible from pods within the same namespace.


Using Secrets reduces the sensitive information defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret.

Note

The raw secret manifest files contain the secret data in base64 format. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). Treat these files as sensitive information, and never commit them to source control.

Kubernetes secrets are stored in *etcd*, a distributed key-value store. AKS allows [encryption at rest of secrets in etcd using customer managed keys](use-kms-etcd-encryption).

# Passive-cold solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. When the region becomes unavailable during a disaster, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

This guide outlines a passive-cold solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with only one cluster actively serving traffic when the application is needed.

Note

The following practice has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Passive-cold solution overview

In this approach, we have two independent AKS clusters being deployed in two Azure regions. When the application is needed, we activate the passive cluster to receive traffic. If the passive cluster goes down, we must manually activate the cold cluster to take over the flow of traffic. We can set this condition through a manual input every time or to specify a certain event.

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented as a “use as needed” workload, which is useful for scenarios that require workloads to run at specific times of day or run on demand. Example use cases for a passive-cold approach include:

- A manufacturing company that needs to run a complex and resource-intensive simulation on a large dataset. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a cloud region that offers high-performance computing and storage services. The passive cluster is only used when the simulation is triggered by the user or by a schedule. If the cluster doesn’t work upon triggering, the cold cluster can be used as a backup and the workload can run on it instead.
- A government agency that needs to maintain a backup of its critical systems and data in case of a cyber attack or natural disaster. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a secure and isolated location that’s not accessible to the public.

## Components

The passive-cold disaster recovery solution uses many Azure services. This example architecture involves the following components:

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. When the app is needed, the passive cluster is activated to receive network traffic.

**Key Vault**: You provision an [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in each region to store secrets and keys.

**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

**Hub-spoke pair**: A hub-spoke pair is deployed for each regional AKS instance. [Azure Firewall Manager](/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/overview) policies manage the firewall rules across each region.

**Container Registry**: The container images for the workload are stored in a managed container registry. With this solution, a single [Azure Container Registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) instance is used for all Kubernetes instances in the cluster. Geo-replication for Azure Container Registry enables you to replicate images to the selected Azure regions and provides continued access to images even if a region experiences an outage.

## Failover process

If the passive cluster isn't functioning properly because of an issue in its specific Azure region, you can activate the cold cluster and redirect all traffic to that cluster's region. You can use this process while the passive cluster is deactivated until it starts working again. The cold cluster can take a couple minutes to come online, as it has been turned off and needs to complete the setup process. This approach isn't ideal for time-sensitive applications. In that case, we recommend considering an [active-active failover](active-active-solution#failover-process).

### Application Pods (Regional)

A Kubernetes deployment object creates multiple replicas of a pod (*ReplicaSet*). If one is unavailable, traffic is routed between the remaining replicas. The Kubernetes *ReplicaSet* attempts to keep the specified number of replicas up and running. If one instance goes down, a new instance should be recreated. [Liveness probes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe) can check the state of the application or process running in the pod. If the pod is unresponsive, the liveness probe removes the pod, which forces the *ReplicaSet* to create a new instance.

For more information, see [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

### Application Pods (Global)

When an entire region becomes unavailable, the pods in the cluster are no longer available to serve requests. In this case, the Azure Front Door instance routes all traffic to the remaining health regions. The Kubernetes clusters and pods in these regions continue to serve requests. To compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster, keep in mind the following guidance:

- Make sure network and compute resources are right sized to absorb any sudden increase in traffic due to region failover. For example, when using Azure Container Network Interface (CNI), make sure you have a subnet that can support all pod IPs with a spiked traffic load.
- Use the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler)to increase the pod replica count to compensate for the increased regional demand. - Use the AKS
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to increase the Kubernetes instance node counts to compensate for the increased regional demand.

### Kubernetes node pools (Regional)

Occasionally, localized failure can occur to compute resources, such as power becoming unavailable in a single rack of Azure servers. To protect your AKS nodes from becoming a single point regional failure, use [Azure Availability Zones](availability-zones). Availability zones ensure that AKS nodes in each availability zone are physically separated from those defined in another availability zones.

### Kubernetes node pools (Global)

In a complete regional failure, Azure Front Door routes traffic to the remaining healthy regions. Again, make sure to compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster.

## Failover testing strategy

While there are no mechanisms currently available within AKS to take down an entire region of deployment for testing purposes, [Azure Chaos Studio](/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-overview) offers the ability to create a chaos experiment on your cluster.

# Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to use virtual nodes in the Azure portal

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. To provide this communication, a virtual network subnet is created and delegated permissions are assigned. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet) by default.

This article shows you how to create a virtual network and subnets, and then deploy an AKS cluster that uses advanced networking using the Azure portal.

Note

For an overview of virtual node region availability and limitations, see [Use virtual nodes in AKS](virtual-nodes).

## Before you begin

You need the ACI service provider registered on your subscription.

Check the status of the ACI provider registration using the

command.`az provider list`

`az provider list --query "[?contains(namespace,'Microsoft.ContainerInstance')]" -o table`

The following example output shows the

*Microsoft.ContainerInstance*provider is*Registered*:`Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy --------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- Microsoft.ContainerInstance Registered RegistrationRequired`

If the provider is

*NotRegistered*, register it using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerInstance`


## Create an AKS cluster

- Navigate to the Azure portal home page.
- Select
**Create a resource**>**Containers**. - On the
**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**resource, select**Create**. - On the
**Basics**page, configure the following options:*Project details*: Select an Azure subscription, then select or create an Azure resource group, such as*myResourceGroup*.*Cluster details*: Enter a**Kubernetes cluster name**, such as*myAKSCluster*. Select a region and Kubernetes version for the AKS cluster.

- Select
**Next: Node pools**and check **Enable virtual nodes*. - Select
**Review + create**. - After the validation completes, select
**Create**.

By default, this process creates a managed cluster identity, which is used for cluster communication and integration with other Azure services. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity). You can also use a service principal as your cluster identity.

This process configures the cluster for advanced networking and the virtual nodes to use their own Azure virtual network subnet. The subnet has delegated permissions to connect Azure resources between the AKS cluster. If you don't already have a delegated subnet, the Azure portal creates and configures an Azure virtual network and subnet with the virtual nodes.

## Connect to the cluster

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. The `kubectl`

client is pre-installed in the Azure Cloud Shell.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the cluster name`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*:`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the single VM node created and the virtual Linux node named

*virtual-node-aci-linux*:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION virtual-node-aci-linux Ready agent 28m v1.11.2 aks-agentpool-14693408-0 Ready agent 32m v1.11.2`


## Deploy a sample app

In the Azure Cloud Shell, create a file named

`virtual-node.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: aci-helloworld spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: aci-helloworld template: metadata: labels: app: aci-helloworld spec: containers: - name: aci-helloworld image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld ports: - containerPort: 80 nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/role: agent beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux type: virtual-kubelet tolerations: - key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider operator: Exists`

The YAML defines a

[nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)and[toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/), which allows the pod to be scheduled on the virtual node. The pod is assigned an internal IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet delegated for use with virtual nodes.Run the application using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f virtual-node.yaml`

View the pods scheduled on the node using the

command with the`kubectl get pods`

`-o wide`

argument.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the

`virtual-node-helloworld`

pod scheduled on the`virtual-node-linux`

node.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE virtual-node-helloworld-9b55975f-bnmfl 1/1 Running 0 4m 10.241.0.4 virtual-node-aci-linux`


Note

If you use images stored in Azure Container Registry, [configure and use a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). A limitation of virtual nodes is you can't use integrated Microsoft Entra service principal authentication. If you don't use a secret, pods scheduled on virtual nodes fail to start and report the error `HTTP response status code 400 error code "InaccessibleImage"`

.

## Test the virtual node pod

To test the pod running on the virtual node, browse to the demo application with a web client. The pod is assigned an internal IP address, so you can easily test the connectivity from another pod on the AKS cluster.

Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it using the following

`kubectl run`

command.`kubectl run -it --rm virtual-node-test --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

Install

`curl`

in the pod using the following`apt-get`

command.`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

Access the address of your pod using the following

`curl`

command and provide your internal IP address.`curl -L http://10.241.0.4`

The following condensed example output shows the demo application.

`<html> <head> <title>Welcome to Azure Container Instances!</title> </head> [...]`

Close the terminal session to your test pod with

`exit`

, which also deletes the pod.`exit`


## Next steps

In this article, you scheduled a pod on the virtual node and assigned a private, internal IP address. If you want, you can instead create a service deployment and route traffic to your pod through a load balancer or ingress controller. For more information, see [Create a basic ingress controller in AKS](ingress-basic).

Virtual nodes are one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

This article is intended for platform administrators or developers who are looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

Note

AKS is [CNCF-certified](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) and is compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure compliance overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/compliance/).

# Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in AKS, you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects issues, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demands. It also regularly checks nodes for a lack of running pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article shows you how to enable and manage the cluster autoscaler in AKS, which is based on the [open-source Kubernetes version](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).

## Before you begin

This article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Use the cluster autoscaler on an AKS cluster

Important

The cluster autoscaler is a Kubernetes component. Although the AKS cluster uses a virtual machine scale set for the nodes, don't manually enable or edit settings for scale set autoscaling. Let the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler manage the required scale settings. For more information, see [Can I modify the AKS resources in the node resource group?](faq)

### Enable the cluster autoscaler on a new cluster

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster using the`az aks create`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command creates a cluster with a single node backed by a virtual machine scale set, enables the cluster autoscaler, sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster

Update an existing cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool using the`az aks update`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command updates an existing AKS cluster to enable the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster and sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to update the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

Disable the cluster autoscaler using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`

Nodes aren't removed when the cluster autoscaler is disabled.


Note

You can manually scale your cluster after disabling the cluster autoscaler using the [ az aks scale](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-scale) command. If you use the horizontal pod autoscaler, it continues to run with the cluster autoscaler disabled, but pods might end up unable to be scheduled if all node resources are in use.

### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.## Use the cluster autoscaler on node pools

### Use the cluster autoscaler on multiple node pools

You can use the cluster autoscaler with [multiple node pools](create-node-pools) and can enable the cluster autoscaler on each individual node pool and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Update the settings on an existing node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the

command and the`az aks nodepool update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`


### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview#enable-cluster-auto-scaler-for-a-node-pool) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.Note

If you plan on using the cluster autoscaler with node pools that span multiple zones and leverage scheduling features related to zones, such as volume topological scheduling, we recommend you have one node pool per zone and enable `--balance-similar-node-groups`

through the autoscaler profile. This ensures the autoscaler can successfully scale up and keep the sizes of the node pools balanced.

## Update the cluster autoscaler settings

As your application demands change, you might need to adjust the cluster autoscaler node count to scale efficiently.

Change the node count using the

command and update the cluster autoscaler using the`az aks update`

`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying your updated node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

The cluster autoscaler enforces the minimum count in cases where the actual count drops below the minimum due to external factors, such as during a spot eviction or when changing the minimum count value from the AKS API.

## Use the cluster autoscaler profile

You can configure more granular details of the cluster autoscaler by changing the default values in the cluster-wide autoscaler profile. For example, a scale down event happens after nodes are under-utilized after 10 minutes. If you have workloads that run every 15 minutes, you might want to change the autoscaler profile to scale down under-utilized nodes after 15 or 20 minutes. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, a default profile is used unless you specify different settings.

Important

The cluster autoscaler profile affects **all node pools** that use the cluster autoscaler. You can't set an autoscaler profile per node pool. When you set the profile, any existing node pools with the cluster autoscaler enabled immediately start using the profile.

### Cluster autoscaler profile settings

The following table lists the available settings for the cluster autoscaler profile:

| Setting | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`scan-interval` |
How often the cluster is reevaluated for scale up or down. | 10 seconds |
`scale-down-delay-after-add` |
How long after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-delay-after-delete` |
How long after node deletion that scale down evaluation resumes. | `scan-interval` |
`scale-down-delay-after-failure` |
How long after scale down failure that scale down evaluation resumes. | Three minutes |
`scale-down-unneeded-time` |
How long a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-unready-time` |
How long an unready node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 20 minutes |
`ignore-daemonsets-utilization` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be ignored when calculating resource utilization for scale down. | `false` |
`daemonset-eviction-for-empty-nodes` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from empty nodes. | `false` |
`daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from non-empty nodes. | `true` |
`scale-down-utilization-threshold` |
The maximum value between the sum of CPU requests and sum of Memory requests of all pods running on the node divided by node's corresponding allocatable resource, below which a node can be considered for scale down. | 0.5 |
`max-graceful-termination-sec` |
Maximum number of seconds the cluster autoscaler waits for pod termination when trying to scale down a node. | 600 seconds |
`balance-similar-node-groups` |
Detects similar node pools and balances the number of nodes between them. | `false` |
`expander` |
Type of node pool
`most-pods` , `random` , `least-waste` , and `priority` . |

`random`

`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods with local storage, for example, EmptyDir or HostPath.`false`

`skip-nodes-with-system-pods`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods from kube-system (except for DaemonSet or mirror pods).`true`

`max-empty-bulk-delete`

`new-pod-scale-up-delay`

`max-total-unready-percentage`

`max-node-provision-time`

`ok-total-unready-count`

Note

The ignore-daemonsets-utilization, daemonset-eviction-for-empty-nodes, and daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes parameters are GA from API version 2024-05-01. If you are using the CLI to update these flags, please ensure you are using version 2.63 or later.

### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on a new cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and set the cluster autoscaler profile using the`az aks create`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on an existing cluster

Set the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the

command and the`az aks update`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter. The following example configures the scan interval setting as*30s*:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s`


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for aggressive scale down

Note

Scaling down aggressively is not recommended for clusters experiencing frequent scale-outs and scale-ins within short intervals, as it could potentially result in extended node provisioning times under these circumstances. Increasing `scale-down-delay-after-add`

can help in these circumstances by keeping the node around longer to handle incoming workloads.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s,scale-down-delay-after-add=0m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=3m,scale-down-unready-time=3m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=1000,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for bursty workloads

```
az aks update \
--resource-group "myResourceGroup" \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=20s,scale-down-delay-after-add=10m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=5m,scale-down-unready-time=5m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=100,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Reset cluster autoscaler profile to default values

Reset the cluster autoscaler profile using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile ""`


## Retrieve cluster autoscaler logs and status

You can retrieve logs and status updates from the cluster autoscaler to help diagnose and debug autoscaler events. AKS manages the cluster autoscaler on your behalf and runs it in the managed control plane. You can enable control plane node to see the logs and operations from the cluster autoscaler.

Set up a rule for resource logs to push cluster autoscaler logs to Log Analytics using the

[instructions here](monitor-aks#aks-control-plane-resource-logs). Make sure you check the box for`cluster-autoscaler`

when selecting options for**Logs**.Select the

**Log**section on your cluster.Enter the following example query into Log Analytics:

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "cluster-autoscaler"`

View cluster autoscaler scale-up not triggered events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,reason=NotTriggerScaleUp`

View cluster autoscaler warning events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,type=Warning`

The cluster autoscaler also writes out the health status to a

`configmap`

named`cluster-autoscaler-status`

. You can retrieve these logs using the following`kubectl`

command:`kubectl get configmap -n kube-system cluster-autoscaler-status -o yaml`


For more information, see the [Kubernetes/autoscaler GitHub project FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#ca-doesnt-work-but-it-used-to-work-yesterday-why).

## Cluster Autoscaler Metrics

You can enable [control plane metrics (Preview)](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from the [cluster autoscaler](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)

## Next steps

This article showed you how to automatically scale the number of AKS nodes. You can also use the horizontal pod autoscaler to automatically adjust the number of pods that run your application. For steps on using the horizontal pod autoscaler, see [Scale applications in AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-scale).

To further help improve cluster resource utilization and free up CPU and memory for other pods, see [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

# Configure AKSNodeClass resources for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to configure `AKSNodeClass`

resources to define Azure-specific settings for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Karpenter. `AKSNodeClass`

allows you to customize various aspects of the nodes that Karpenter provisions, such as the virtual machine (VM) image, operating system (OS) disk size, maximum pods per node, and kubelet configurations.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Overview of AKSNodeClass resources

`AKSNodeClass`

resources enable you to configure Azure-specific settings for NAP. Each [ NodePool resource](node-auto-provisioning-node-pools) must reference an

`AKSNodeClass`

using `spec.template.spec.nodeClassRef`

. You can have multiple `NodePools`

that point to the same `AKSNodeClass`

, allowing you to share common Azure configurations across different node pools.## Image family configuration

The `imageFamily`

field dictates the default VM image and bootstrapping logic for nodes provisioned through the `AKSNodeClass`

. If you don't specify an image family, the default is `Ubuntu2204`

. GPUs are supported with both image families on compatible VM sizes.

### Supported image families

: Ubuntu 22.04 Long Term Support (LTS) is the default Linux distribution for AKS nodes.`Ubuntu`

: Azure Linux is Microsoft's alternative Linux distribution for AKS workloads. For more information, see the`AzureLinux`

[Azure Linux documentation](/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-linux)

#### Example image family configuration

The following example configures the `AKSNodeClass`

to use the `AzureLinux`

image family:

```
spec:
imageFamily: AzureLinux
```


#### FIPS compliant node image configuration

You can enable Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) compliant node images also. For more in FIPS in AKS, visit our [FIPS documentation](enable-fips-nodes)

The `fipsMode`

field is set by default to Disabled, and can be set to the following options:

- FIPS - select FIPS-compliant node images
- Disabled - do not use FIPS-compliant node images

The following example configures the 'AKSNodeClass' to select FIPS-compliant node images by setting `fipsMode`

to `FIPS`

:

```
spec:
fipsMode: FIPS
```


## Virtual network (VNet) subnet configuration

The `vnetSubnetID`

field specifies which Azure VNet subnet should be used for provisioning node network interfaces. This field is optional. If you don't specify a subnet, NAP uses the default subnet configured during Karpenter installation. For more information, see [Subnet configurations for NAP](node-auto-provisioning-networking#subnet-configurations-for-nap).

### Example subnet configuration

The subnet ID must be in the full Azure Resource Manager (ARM) format, as shown in the following example:

```
spec:
vnetSubnetID: "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet-name}/subnets/{subnet-name}"
```


## OS disk size configuration

The `osDiskSizeGB`

field specifies the size of the OS disk in gigabytes. The default value is 128 GB, and the minimum value is 30 GB.

Consider larger OS disk sizes for workloads that:

- Store significant data locally.
- Require extra space for container images.
- Have high disk I/O requirements.

### Example OS disk size configuration

```
spec:
osDiskSizeGB: 256 # 256 GB OS disk
```


## Ephemeral OS disk configuration

NAP automatically uses [Ephemeral OS disks](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks) when available and suitable for the requested disk size. Ephemeral OS disks provide better performance and lower cost compared to managed disks.

### Ephemeral disk selection criteria

The system automatically chooses Ephemeral disks in the following scenarios:

- The VM instance type supports Ephemeral OS disks.
- The Ephemeral disk capacity is greater than or equal to the requested
`osDiskSizeGB`

. - The VM has sufficient ephemeral storage capacity.

If these conditions aren't met, the system falls back to using managed disks.

### Ephemeral disk types and prioritization

Azure VMs can have different types of ephemeral storage. The system uses the following priority order:

**NVMe disks**(highest performance)**Cache disks**(balanced performance)**Resource disks**(basic performance)

### Example ephemeral disk configuration

You can use node pool requirements to ensure nodes have sufficient ephemeral disk capacity, as shown in the following example:

```
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
name: ephemeral-disk-pool
spec:
template:
spec:
requirements:
- key: karpenter.azure.com/sku-storage-ephemeralos-maxsize
operator: Gt
values: ["128"] # Require ephemeral disk larger than 128 GB
nodeClassRef:
apiVersion: karpenter.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: AKSNodeClass
name: my-node-class
---
apiVersion: karpenter.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: AKSNodeClass
metadata:
name: my-node-class
spec:
osDiskSizeGB: 128 # This will use ephemeral disk if available and large enough
```


This configuration ensures that only VM instance types with ephemeral disks larger than 128 GB are selected, guaranteeing ephemeral disk usage for the specified OS disk size.

## Maximum pods configuration

The `maxPods`

field specifies the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled on a node. This setting affects both cluster density and network configuration.

The minimum value for `maxPods`

is 10, and the maximum value is 250.

### Default behavior for `maxPods`


The default behavior for `maxPods`

depends on the network plugin configuration. The following table summarizes the defaults:

| Network plugin configuration | Default `maxPods` per node |
|---|---|
| Azure CNI with standard networking (v1 or NodeSubnet) | 30 |
| Azure CNI with overlay networking | 250 |
| None (no network plugin) | 250 |
| Other configurations | 110 (standard Kubernetes default) |

### Example maximum pods configuration

```
spec:
maxPods: 50 # Allow up to 50 pods per node
```


## LocalDNS configuration

LocalDNS deploys a node level DNS proxy that resolves DNS queries closer to workloads, reducing query latency and improving resiliency during transient DNS disruptions. For more information, see the [LocalDNS documentation](localdns-custom). By default, LocalDNS is set to Disabled and can be configured to the following options:

`Disabled`

(default) - Disables the LocalDNS feature. DNS queries aren't resolved locally on the node.`Preferred`

- AKS manages LocalDNS enablement based on the Kubernetes version of the node pool. The configuration is always validated and included, but LocalDNS isn't enabled unless the correct Kubernetes version is used.`Required`

- LocalDNS is enforced on the node pool if all prerequisites are satisfied. If the requirements aren't met, the deployment fails.

### Example LocalDNS configuration

You can customize LocalDNS configurations such as `vnetDNSOverrides`

and `kubeDNSOverrides`

. For more details on the supported plugins, see [Customize LocalDNS](localdns-custom).

```
spec:
LocalDNS:
mode: Required
vnetDNSOverrides:
- zone: "."
cacheDuration: "30s"
forwardDestination: VnetDNS
forwardPolicy: Random
maxConcurrent: 80
protocol: ForceTCP
queryLogging: Log
serveStale: Immediate
serveStaleDuration: "100s"
- zone: "cluster.local"
cacheDuration: "40s"
forwardDestination: VnetDNS
forwardPolicy: Sequential
maxConcurrent: 70
protocol: PreferUDP
queryLogging: Error
serveStale: Disable
serveStaleDuration: "30s"
kubeDNSOverrides:
- zone: "."
cacheDuration: "30s"
forwardDestination: ClusterCoreDNS
forwardPolicy: RoundRobin
maxConcurrent: 100
protocol: PreferUDP
queryLogging: Log
serveStale: Immediate
serveStaleDuration: "60s"
- zone: "cluster.local"
cacheDuration: "10s"
forwardDestination: ClusterCoreDNS
forwardPolicy: Sequential
maxConcurrent: 50
protocol: PreferUDP
queryLogging: Error
serveStale: Disable
serveStaleDuration: "30s"
```


## Kubelet configuration

The `kubelet`

section allows you to configure various kubelet parameters that affect node behavior. These parameters are typical kubelet arguments, so the Azure provider simply passes them through to the kubelet on the node.

Important

**Configure kubelet settings carefully**, and test any changes in nonproduction environments first.

### CPU management

The following settings control CPU management behavior for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
cpuManagerPolicy: "static" # or "none"
cpuCFSQuota: true
cpuCFSQuotaPeriod: "100ms"
```


`cpuManagerPolicy`

: Controls how the kubelet allocates CPU resources. Set to`"static"`

for CPU pinning in latency-sensitive workloads.`cpuCFSQuota`

: Enables CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota enforcement for containers that specify CPU limits.`cpuCFSQuotaPeriod`

: Sets the CPU CFS quota period.

### Image garbage collection

The following settings control image garbage collection behavior for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
imageGCHighThresholdPercent: 85
imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 80
```


These settings control when the kubelet performs garbage collection of container images:

`imageGCHighThresholdPercent`

: Disk usage percentage that triggers image garbage collection.`imageGCLowThresholdPercent`

: Target disk usage percentage after garbage collection.

### Topology management

The following setting controls the topology manager policy for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
topologyManagerPolicy: "best-effort" # none, restricted, best-effort, single-numa-node
```


The topology manager helps coordinate resource allocation for latency-sensitive workloads across CPU and device (like GPU) resources.

### System configuration

The following settings allow you to configure extra system parameters for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
allowedUnsafeSysctls:
- "kernel.msg*"
- "net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu"
containerLogMaxSize: "50Mi"
containerLogMaxFiles: 5
podPidsLimit: 4096
```


`allowedUnsafeSysctls`

: List of permitted unsafe sysctls that pods can use.`containerLogMaxSize`

: Maximum size of container log files before rotation.`containerLogMaxFiles`

: Maximum number of container log files to retain.`podPidsLimit`

: Maximum number of processes allowed in any pod.

## Azure resource tags configuration

You can specify Azure resource tags that apply to all VM instances created using a particular `AKSNodeClass`

resource. Tags are useful for cost tracking, resource organization, and compliance requirements.

### Tag limitations

- Azure resource tags have a limit of 50 tags per resource.
- Tag names are case-insensitive but tag values are case-sensitive.
- Azure reserves some tag names that can't be used. For more information, see
[Tag guidance and limits](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources#tag-restrictions).

### Example tags configuration

```
spec:
tags:
Environment: "production"
Team: "platform"
Application: "web-service"
CostCenter: "engineering"
```

# Tutorial - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can quickly create a production ready Kubernetes cluster.

In this tutorial, you deploy a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learn how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you created a container image and uploaded it to an ACR instance. Start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app) to follow along.

- If you're using Azure CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with
`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this tutorial requires that you're running Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Check your version with
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - If you're using Azure Developer CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure Developer CLI version 1.5.1 or later. Check your version with
`azd version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure Developer CLI](/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. If a user is assigned multiple roles, permissions are combined. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster.

To learn more about AKS and Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with `az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're using the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Install the Kubernetes CLI

You use the Kubernetes CLI, [ kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed. If you're running the commands locally, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to install `kubectl`

.Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`


## Create an AKS cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. Permissions are combined when users are assigned multiple roles. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster. For more information, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

For information about AKS resource limits and region availability, see [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions).

Important

This tutorial creates a three-node cluster. To ensure your cluster operates reliably, you should run at least two nodes. A minimum of three nodes is required to use Azure Container Storage. If you get an error message when trying to create the cluster, then you might need to request a quota increase for your Azure subscription or try a different Azure region. Alternatively, you can omit the node VM size parameter to use the default VM size.

To allow an AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources, the Azure platform automatically creates a cluster identity. In this example, the cluster identity is [granted the right to pull images](cluster-container-registry-integration) from the ACR instance you created in the previous tutorial. To execute the command successfully, you must have an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role in your Azure subscription.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a cluster named`az aks create`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*. This resource group was created in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr)in the*westus2*region. We'll continue to use the environment variable,`$ACRNAME`

, that we set in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr). If you don't have this environment variable set, set it now to the same value you used previously.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size standard_l8s_v3 \ --generate-ssh-keys \ --attach-acr $ACRNAME`

Note

If you already generated SSH keys, you might encounter an error similar to

`linuxProfile.ssh.publicKeys.keyData is invalid`

. To proceed, retry the command without the`--generate-ssh-keys`

parameter.

To avoid needing an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role, you can also manually configure a service principal to pull images from ACR. For more information, see [ACR authentication with service principals](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal) or [Authenticate from Kubernetes with a pull secret](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes). Alternatively, you can use a [managed identity](use-managed-identity) instead of a service principal for easier management.

## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the AKS cluster named`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in*myResourceGroup*.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify connection to your cluster using the

command, which returns a list of cluster nodes.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the cluster nodes:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000000 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000001 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000002 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9`


## Next step

In this tutorial, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster in AKS and configured `kubectl`

to connect to the cluster. You learned how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an ACR.
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to deploy Azure Container Storage on your cluster and create a generic ephemeral volume. If you're using Azure Developer CLI, or if you weren't able to use a storage optimized VM type due to quota issues, proceed directly to the [Deploy containerized application](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-application) tutorial.

# Uninstall the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to uninstall the OMS add-on and related resources from your AKS cluster.

Warning

Microsoft has announced the retirement of the [Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). The upstream OSM project has also been retired by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/). Identify any existing OSM configurations and migrate them to equivalent Istio configurations. For migration steps, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

## Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster

Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster using the

parameter.`az aks disable-addons \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --addons open-service-mesh`


## Remove OSM resources

Uninstall the remaining resources on the cluster using the

`osm uninstall cluster-wide-resources`

command.`osm uninstall cluster-wide-resources`

Note

For version 1.1, the command is

`osm uninstall mesh --delete-cluster-wide-resources`

Important

You must remove these additional resources after you disable the OSM add-on. Leaving these resources on your cluster may cause issues if you enable the OSM add-on again in the future.

# Operate cost-optimized Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at scale

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides guidance on how to operate cost optimized Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at scale.

## Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)

[Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/overview) enables at-scale management of multiple AKS clusters. You can create a *Fleet resource* and use it to manage multiple clusters as a single entity, orchestrate updates across multiple clusters, and propagate Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters. When creating a new *Fleet resource*, you can create it with or without a *hub cluster*. A *hub cluster* is a managed AKS cluster that acts a hub to store and propagate Kubernetes resources.


Kubernetes Fleet can help you reduce the management overhead cost of operating multiple clusters by providing a single entry point for managing multiple clusters. For more information, see the [Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager documentation](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/).

### Resource propagation

Kubernetes Fleet provides *resource propagation* to enable at-scale management of Kubernetes resources. You can create Kubernetes resources in the *hub cluster* and propagate them to specified *member clusters* using the `MemberCluster`

and `ClusterResourcePlacement`

custom resources.


For more information, see [Kubernetes Fleet resource placement from hub cluster to member clusters](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-resource-propagation).

### Intelligent resource placement

Kubernetes Fleet provides *intelligent resource placement*, which can make scheduling decisions based on node count, cost of compute/memory in target member clusters, and resource availability in target member clusters. This allows you to place workloads in the most cost-effective member cluster based on your workload requirements.


For more information, see [Intelligent cross-cluster Kubernetes resource placement using Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/intelligent-resource-placement).

## AKS Automatic

[AKS Automatic](intro-aks-automatic) offers an experience that makes the most common tasks on Kubernetes fast and frictionless, while preserving the flexibility, extensibility, and consistency of Kubernetes. Azure takes care of cluster setup, including node management, scaling, and security, and preconfigures settings that follow AKS well-architected recommendations.

AKS Automatic clusters are designed to help reduce management overhead costs of creating cluster templates, managing the cluster lifecycle, guardrails, and updates. Scaling is seamless and dynamic. Nodes are created based on workload requests using [node autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision) and workloads are automatically scaled with features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), [Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](keda-about), and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

## Azure Advisor cost recommendations

AKS cost recommendations in Azure Advisor provide recommendations to help you achieve cost-efficiency without sacrificing reliability. Advisor analyzes your resource configurations and recommends optimization solutions. For more information, see [Get Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost recommendations in Azure Advisor](cost-advisors).

# Use Deployment Safeguards to enforce best practices in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Deployment Safeguards to enforce best practices on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

Note

Deployment Safeguards is turned on by default in AKS Automatic.

Throughout the development lifecycle, it is common for bugs, issues, and other problems to arise if the initial deployment of your Kubernetes resources includes misconfigurations. To ease the burden of Kubernetes development, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers Deployment Safeguards. Deployment Safeguards enforce Kubernetes best practices in your AKS cluster through Azure Policy controls.

Deployment Safeguards offer two levels of configuration:

`Warn`

: Displays warning messages in the code terminal to alert you of any noncompliant cluster configurations but still allows the request to go through.`Enforce`

: Enforces compliant configurations by denying and mutating deployments if they don't follow best practices.

After you configure Deployment Safeguards for 'Warn' or 'Enforce', Deployment Safeguards programmatically assess your Kubernetes resources at creation or update time for compliance. Deployment Safeguards also display aggregated compliance information across your workloads at a per resource level via Azure Policy's compliance dashboard in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/%7E/Compliance) or in your CLI or terminal. Running a noncompliant workload indicates that your cluster is not following best practices and that workloads on your cluster are at risk of experiencing issues caused by your cluster configuration.

## Prerequisites

Note

Cluster admins don't need Azure Policy permissions to enable or disable Deployment Safeguards. However, it's required to have the Azure Policy add-on installed.

- You need to enable the Azure Policy add-on for AKS. For more information, see
[Enable Azure Policy on your AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks). This includes registering the`Microsoft.PolicyInsights`

resource provider in your subscription.

## Deployment Safeguards policies

The following table lists the policies that become active and the Kubernetes resources they target when you enable Deployment Safeguards. You can view the [currently available Deployment Safeguards](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/InitiativeDetail.ReactView/id/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2Fc047ea8e-9c78-49b2-958b-37e56d291a44/scopes/) in the Azure portal as an Azure Policy definition or at [Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Kubernetes Service](/en-us/azure/aks/policy-reference#policy-definitions). The intention behind this collection is to create a common and generic list of best practices applicable to most users and use cases.

| Deployment safeguard policy | Mutation outcome if available |
|---|---|
| Cannot Edit Individual Nodes | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster containers CPU and memory resource limits shouldn't exceed the specified limits | Sets CPU resource limits to 500m if not set and sets memory limits to 500Mi if no path is present |
| Must Have Anti Affinity Rules or topologySpreadConstraintsSet | N/A |
| No AKS Specific Labels | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed images | N/A |
| Reserved System Pool Taints | Removes the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint from a user node pool if not set. AKS uses the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint to keep customer pods away from the system pool. This configuration ensures a clear separation between AKS components and customer pods and prevents eviction of customer pods that don't tolerate the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint. |
| Ensure cluster containers have readiness or liveness probes configured | N/A |
| Kubernetes clusters should use Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver StorageClass | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster services should use unique selectors | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster container images should not include latest image tag | N/A |

If you want to submit an idea or request for Deployment Safeguards, open an issue in the [AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS) and add `[Deployment Safeguards request]`

to the beginning of the title.

## Pod Security Standards in Deployment Safeguards

Note

Baseline Pod Security Standards are now turned on by default in AKS Automatic. The baseline Pod Security Standards in AKS Automatic can't be turned off.

Deployment Safeguards also supports the ability to turn on [Baseline, Restricted and Privileged Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/). To ensure your workloads deploy successfully, make sure each manifest complies with the Baseline or Restricted Pod Security requirements. By default, Azure Kubernetes Service uses Privileged Pod Security Standards.

| Policy | Error Message | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| AppArmor | `AppArmor annotation values must be undefined/nil, runtime/default, or localhost/*` or `AppArmor profile type must be one of: undefined/nil, RuntimeDefault, or Localhost` |
Remove any specification of AppArmor. Kubernetes by default applies apparmor settings. "On supported hosts, the RuntimeDefault AppArmor profile is applied by default". |
| Host Namespaces | `Host network namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostNetwork is set to true'` or `'Host PID namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostPID is set to true'` or `'Host IPC namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostIPC is set to true'` |
Set those values to false, or remove specifying the fields. |
| Privileged Containers | `'Privileged [ephemeral\|init\|N/A] containers are disallowed: spec.containers[*].securityContext.privileged is set to true'` |
Set the appropriate securityContext.privileged field to false, or remove the field. |
| Capabilities | Message will start with `'Disallowed capabilities detected` |
Remove the capability shown from the container's manifest. |
| HostPath volumes | `HostPath volumes are forbidden under restricted security policy unless containers mounting them are from allowed images` |
Remove the HostPath volume and volume mount. |
| Host Ports | HostPorts are forbidden under baseline security policy | Remove the host port specification from the offending container. |
| SELinux | `SELinux type must be one of: undefined/empty, container_t, container_init_t, container_kvm_t, or container_engine_t` |
Set the container's securityContext.seLinuxOptions.type field to one of the allowed values. |
| /proc Mount Type | ProcMount must be undefined/nil or 'Default' in spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount | Set "* `spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount` " to 'Default' or have it be undefined. |
| Seccomp | `Seccomp profile must not be explicitly set to Unconfined. Allowed values are: undefined/nil, RuntimeDefault, or Localhost` |
Set `securityContext.seccompProfile.type` on the pod or containers to one of the allowed values. |
| Sysctls | `Disallowed sysctl detected. Only baseline Kubernetes pod security standard sysctls are permitted` |
Remove the disallowed systctls( see the
|

`Only the following volume types are allowed under restricted policy: configMap, csi, downwardAPI, emptyDir, ephemeral, persistentVolumeClaim, projected, secret`

`Privilege escalation must be set to false under restricted policy`

`* `

spec.containers[*].securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation`` must explicitly be set to false for each container, initContainer, and ephemeralContainer.`Containers must not run as root user in spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsNonRoot`

`'Containers must not run as root user: spec.securityContext.runAsUser is set to 0'`

`Seccomp profile must be "RuntimeDefault" or "Localhost" under restricted policy`

`securityContext.seccompProfile.type`

on the pod or containers to one of the allowed values. This differs from the baseline in the fact that the restricted policy doesn't allow an undefined value.`All containers must drop ALL capabilities under restricted policy`

or `Only NET_BIND_SERVICE may be added to capabilities under restricted policy`

## Enable Deployment Safeguards

Note

Using the Deployment Safeguards `Enforce`

level means you're opting in to deployments being blocked and mutated. Consider how these policies might work with your AKS cluster before enabling `Enforce`

.

### Enable Deployment Safeguards on an existing cluster

Enable Deployment Safeguards on an existing cluster that has the Azure Policy add-on enabled using the `az aks safeguard create`

command with the `--level`

flag. If you want to receive noncompliance warnings, set the `--level`

to `Warn`

. If you want to deny or mutate all noncompliant deployments, set it to `Enforce`

.

```
az aks safeguards create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Enforce
```


You can also enable Deployment Safeguards by using the `--cluster`

flag and specifying the cluster resource ID.

```
az aks safeguards create --cluster <ID> --level Enforce
```


If you want to update the Deployment Safeguards level of an existing cluster, run the following command with the new value for `--level`

.

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn
```


### Excluding namespaces

You can also exclude certain namespaces from Deployment Safeguards. When you exclude a namespace, activity in that namespace is unaffected by Deployment Safeguards warnings or enforcement.

For example, to exclude the namespaces `ns1`

and `ns2`

, use a space separated list of namespaces with the `--excluded-ns`

flag, as shown in the following example:

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn --excluded-ns ns1 ns2
```


### Turn on Pod Security Standards

Note

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses `Privileged`

Pod Security Standards by default. If you want to revert to the default configuration, set the `--pss-level`

flag to `Privileged`

.

To enable Pod Security Standards in Deployment Safeguards, use the `--pss-level`

flag to select one of the following levels: `Baseline`

, `Restricted`

, or `Privileged`

.

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn --pss-level <Baseline|Restricted|Privileged>
```


### Update your Deployment Safeguard version

Deployment Safeguards adhere to the [AKS addon versioning scheme](supported-kubernetes-versions). Each new version of a Deployment Safeguard will be released as a new minor version in AKS. These updates will be communicated through the [AKS GitHub release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) and reflected in the "Deployment Safeguards Policies" table in our documentation.

To learn more about AKS versioning and addons, refer to the following documentation: [aks-component-versions](supported-kubernetes-versions) and [aks-versioning-for-addons](integrations#add-ons).

## Verify compliance across clusters

After deploying your Kubernetes manifest, you see warnings or a potential denial message in your CLI or terminal if the cluster isn't compliant with Deployment Safeguards, as shown in the following examples:

**Warn**

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Warning: [azurepolicy-k8sazurev1antiaffinityrules-ceffa082711831ebffd1] Deployment with 2 replicas should have either podAntiAffinity or topologySpreadConstraints set to avoid disruptions due to nodes crashing
deployment.apps/simple-web created
```


**Enforce**

With Deployment Safeguard mutations, the `Enforce`

level mutates your Kubernetes resources when applicable. However, your Kubernetes resources still need to pass all safeguards to deploy successfully. If any safeguard policies fail, your resource is denied and won't be deployed.

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "deployment.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [azurepolicy-k8sazurev1antiaffinityrules-ceffa082711831ebffd1] Deployment with 2 replicas should have either podAntiAffinity or topologySpreadConstraints set to avoid disruptions due to nodes crashing
```


If your Kubernetes resources comply with the applicable mutation safeguards and meet all other safeguard requirements, they'll be successfully deployed, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/simple-web created
```


## Verify compliance across clusters using the Azure Policy dashboard

To verify Deployment Safeguards have been applied and to check on your cluster's compliance, navigate to the Azure portal page for your cluster and select **Policies**, then select **go to Azure Policy**.

From the list of policies and initiatives, select the initiative associated with Deployment Safeguards. You see a dashboard showing compliance state across your AKS cluster.

Note

To properly assess compliance across your AKS cluster, the Azure Policy initiative must be scoped to your cluster's resource group.

## Disable Deployment Safeguards

To disable Deployment Safeguards on your cluster, use the `delete`

command.

```
az aks safeguards delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>
```


## FAQ

#### Can I create my own mutations?

No. If you have an idea for a safeguard, open an issue in the [AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS) and add `[Deployment Safeguards request]`

to the beginning of the title.

#### Can I pick and choose which mutations I want in Enforcement?

No. Deployment Safeguards is all or nothing. Once you turn on Warn or Enforce, all safeguards are active.

#### Why did my deployment resource get admitted even though it wasn't following best practices?

Deployment Safeguards enforce best practice standards through Azure Policy controls and has policies that validate against Kubernetes resources. To evaluate and enforce cluster components, Azure Policy extends [Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/). Gatekeeper enforcement also currently operates in a [ fail-open model](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/failing-closed/#considerations). As there's no guarantee that Gatekeeper responds to our networking call, we make sure that in that case, the validation is skipped so that the deny doesn't block your deployments.

To learn more, see [workload validation in Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/workload-resources/).

# Customize CoreDNS for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) for cluster DNS management and resolution with all *1.12.x* and higher clusters. AKS is a managed service, so you can't modify the main configuration for CoreDNS (a *CoreFile*). Instead, you use a Kubernetes *ConfigMap* to override the default settings. To see the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMaps, use the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

This article shows you how to use ConfigMaps for basic CoreDNS customization options in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Note

Previously, AKS used `kube-dns`

for cluster DNS management and resolution, but it's now deprecated. `kube-dns`

offered different [customization options](https://www.danielstechblog.io/using-custom-dns-server-for-domain-specific-name-resolution-with-azure-kubernetes-service/) via a Kubernetes config map. CoreDNS is **not** backwards compatible with `kube-dns`

. You must update any previous customizations to work with CoreDNS.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Verify the version of CoreDNS you're running. The configuration values might change between versions.

## Plugin support

All built-in CoreDNS plugins are supported. No add-on/third party plugins are supported.

Important

When you create configurations like the ones in this article, the names you specify in the `data`

section must end in `.server`

or `.override`

. This naming convention is defined in the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMap, which you can view using the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

## Configure DNS name rewrites

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own fully qualified domain name (FQDN).`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { log errors rewrite stop { name regex (.*)\.<domain to be rewritten>\.com {1}.default.svc.cluster.local answer name (.*)\.default\.svc\.cluster\.local {1}.<domain to be rewritten>.com } forward . /etc/resolv.conf # You can redirect this to a specific DNS server such as 10.0.0.10, but that server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name }`

Important

If you redirect to a DNS server, such as the CoreDNS service IP, that DNS server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name.

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Verify the customizations were applied using the

command.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns-custom -o yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Specify a forward server for your network traffic

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace the`forward`

name and`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { forward foo.com 1.1.1.1 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Use custom domains

You might want to configure custom domains that can only be resolved internally. For example, you might want to resolve the custom domain *puglife.local*, which isn't a valid top-level domain. Without a custom domain ConfigMap, the AKS cluster can't resolve the address.

Create a new file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domain and IP address with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: puglife.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension puglife.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 192.11.0.1 # This is my test/dev DNS server }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Configure stub domains

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domains and IP addresses with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension abc.com:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 1.2.3.4 } my.cluster.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 2.3.4.5 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Add custom host-to-IP mappings

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the IP addresses and hostnames with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom # This is the name of the ConfigMap you can overwrite with your changes namespace: kube-system data: test.override: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .override file extension hosts { 10.0.0.1 example1.org 10.0.0.2 example2.org 10.0.0.3 example3.org fallthrough }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`

# Use a public standard load balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Azure Load Balancer](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model that supports both inbound and outbound scenarios. It distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to the back end pool instances.

A **public** load balancer integrated with AKS serves two purposes:

- Provide outbound connections to the cluster nodes inside the AKS virtual network (VNet) by translating the private IP address to a public IP address part of its
*outbound pool*. - Provide access to applications via Kubernetes services of type
`LoadBalancer`

, enabling you to easily scale your applications and create highly available services.

This article covers integration with a public load balancer on AKS. For internal load balancer integration, see [Use an internal load balancer in AKS](internal-lb).

## Prerequisites

- Azure Load Balancer is available in two SKUs:
*Basic*and*Standard*. The*Standard*SKU is used by default when you create an AKS cluster. The*Standard*SKU gives you access to added functionality, such as a larger backend pool,[multiple node pools](create-node-pools),[Availability Zones](availability-zones), and is[secure by default](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview#securebydefault). It's the recommended load balancer SKU for AKS. For more information on the*Basic*and*Standard*SKUs, see[Azure Load Balancer SKU comparison](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus). - For a full list of the supported annotations for Kubernetes services with type
`LoadBalancer`

, see[LoadBalancer annotations](https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/loadbalancer/#loadbalancer-annotations). - This article assumes you have an AKS cluster with the
*Standard*SKU Azure Load Balancer. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[the Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

Important

If you'd prefer to use your own gateway, firewall, or proxy to provide outbound connection, you can skip the creation of the load balancer outbound pool and respective frontend IP by using [ outbound type as UserDefinedRouting (UDR)](egress-outboundtype). The outbound type defines the egress method for a cluster and defaults to type

`LoadBalancer`

.## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support a load balancer with the *Standard* SKU:

AKS manages the lifecycle and operations of agent nodes. Modifying the IaaS resources associated with the agent nodes isn't supported. An example of an unsupported operation is making manual changes to the load balancer resource group.

At least one public IP or IP prefix is required for allowing egress traffic from the AKS cluster. The public IP or IP prefix is required to maintain connectivity between the control plane and agent nodes and to maintain compatibility with previous versions of AKS. You have the following options for specifying public IPs or IP prefixes with a

*Standard*SKU load balancer:- Provide your own public IPs.
- Provide your own public IP prefixes.
- Specify a number up to 100 to allow the AKS cluster to create that many
*Standard*SKU public IPs in the same resource group as the AKS cluster. This resource group is usually named with`MC_`

at the beginning. AKS assigns the public IP to the*Standard*SKU load balancer. By default, one public IP is automatically created in the same resource group as the AKS cluster if no public IP, public IP prefix, or number of IPs is specified. You also must allow public addresses and avoid creating any Azure policies that ban IP creation.

A public IP created by AKS can't be reused as a custom bring your own (BYO) public IP address. You must create and manage all custom IP addresses.

You can only define the load balancer SKU when you create an AKS cluster. You can't change the load balancer SKU after an AKS cluster has been created.

You can only use one type of load balancer SKU (

*Basic*or*Standard*) in a single cluster.*Standard*SKU load balancers only support*Standard*SKU IP addresses.[Private Link Service](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview)isn't supported when the load balancer backend pool type is set to`nodeIP`

.

## Create a load balancer service in AKS

After you create an AKS cluster with outbound type `LoadBalancer`

(default), your cluster is ready to use the load balancer to expose services.

Create a service manifest named

`public-svc.yaml`

, which creates a public service of type`LoadBalancer`

.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: public-svc spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: public-app`


## Specify the load balancer IP address

If you want to use a specific IP address with the load balancer, you have two options to specify the IP address:

**Set service annotations**(recommended): Use`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

for an IPv4 address and`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6`

for an IPv6 address.**Add the**: Add the*LoadBalancerIP*property to the load balancer YAML manifest`Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`

property to the load balancer YAML manifest. This field is deprecating following[upstream Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), and it can't support dual-stack. Current usage remains the same and existing services are expected to work without modification.

## Deploy the load balancer service manifest

Deploy the public service manifest using

and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f public-svc.yaml`

The Azure Load Balancer is configured with a new public IP that fronts the new service. Since the Azure Load Balancer can have multiple frontend IPs, each new service that you deploy gets a new dedicated frontend IP to be uniquely accessed.

Confirm your service is created and the load balancer is configured using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service public-svc`

When you view the service details, the public IP address created for this service on the load balancer is shown in the

*EXTERNAL-IP*column of the output. It might take a few minutes for the IP address to change from*<pending>*to an actual public IP address. The following example output shows successful creation of the service:`NAMESPACE NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE default public-svc LoadBalancer 10.0.39.110 203.0.113.187 80:32068/TCP 52s`

Get more detailed information about your service using the

`kubectl describe service`

command.`kubectl describe service public-svc`

The following example output is a condensed version of the output after you run

`kubectl describe service`

.*LoadBalancer Ingress*shows the external IP address exposed by your service.*IP*shows the internal addresses.`Name: public-svc Namespace: default Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Selector: app=public-app ... IP: 10.0.39.110 ... LoadBalancer Ingress: 203.0.113.187 ... TargetPort: 80/TCP NodePort: 32068/TCP ... Session Affinity: None External Traffic Policy: Cluster ...`
