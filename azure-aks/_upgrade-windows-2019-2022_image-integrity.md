Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When upgrading the OS version of a running Windows workload on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to deploy a new node pool to ensure the Windows versions match on each node pool. This article describes the steps to upgrade the OS version for Windows workloads on AKS.

## Windows Server OS version support

When a new Windows Server OS version is released, AKS is committed to supporting it. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of the fixes, improvements, and new functionality. AKS provides a five-year support lifecycle for every Windows Server version, starting with Windows Server 2022. During this period, AKS releases a new version that supports a newer version of Windows Server OS for you to upgrade to. After the five-year lifecycle ends, you must migrate workloads to newer supported versions to ensure compatibility, security updates, and continued support from AKS.

Note

[Windows Server 2019 retires on March 1, 2026](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2019 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2019 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2019 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.33 and above. Starting on April 1, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail.[Windows Server 2022 retires on March 15, 2027](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2022 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2022 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2022 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.36 and above. Starting on April 1, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail.

For more information, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To stay up to date on the latest Windows Server OS versions and learn more about our roadmap of what's planned for support on AKS, see our [AKS public roadmap](https://github.com/azure/aks/projects/1).

## Limitations

- Node pool update to migrate from one Windows Server version to another isn't supported.
- Different Windows Server versions can't coexist on the same node pool on AKS. You need to create a new node pool to host the new OS version. It's important that you match the permissions and access of the previous node pool to the new one.
- Windows Server 2025 (preview) is supported starting in Kubernetes version 1.32.

## Before you begin

- Update the
`FROM`

statement in your Dockerfile to the new OS version. - Check your application and verify the container app works on the new OS version.
- Deploy the verified container app on AKS to a development or testing environment.
- Take note of the new image name or tag for use in this article.

Note

To learn how to build a Dockerfile for Windows workloads, see [Dockerfile on Windows](/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/manage-windows-dockerfile) and [Optimize Windows Dockerfiles](/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/optimize-windows-dockerfile).

### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using the [`az feature register`

][az-feature-register] command.`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the [

`az feature show`

][az-feature-show] command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using the [`az provider register`

][az-provider-register] command.`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Add a new node pool to an existing cluster

Add a node pool with your desired OS version to your existing cluster:

[Use CLI to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-cli)to an existing cluster.[Use Portal to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-portal)to an existing cluster.[Use PowerShell to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-powershell)to an existing cluster.[Use Terraform to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-terraform)to an existing cluster.

## Update the YAML file

Node Selector is the most common and recommended option for placement of Windows pods on Windows nodes.

Add Node Selector to your YAML file by adding the following annotation:

`nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": windows`

The annotation finds any available Windows node and places the pod on that node (following all other scheduling rules). When upgrading your OS version, you need to enforce the placement on a Windows node and a node running the latest OS version. To accomplish this, one option is to use a different annotation. Update

`<OSSKU>`

to match the ossku your desired Windows OS version, for example`Windows2025`

.`nodeSelector: "kubernetes.azure.com/os-sku": <OSSKU>`

Once you update the

`nodeSelector`

in the YAML file, you also need to update the container image you want to use. You can get this information from the previous step in which you created a new version of the containerized application by changing the`FROM`

statement on your Dockerfile.Note

You should use the same YAML file you used to initially deploy the application. This ensures that no other configuration changes besides the

`nodeSelector`

and container image.

## Apply the updated YAML file to the existing workload

View the nodes on your cluster using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes -o wide`

The following example output shows all nodes on the cluster, including the new node pool you created and the existing node pools:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION INTERNAL-IP EXTERNAL-IP OS-IMAGE KERNEL-VERSION CONTAINER-RUNTIME aks-agentpool-18877473-vmss000000 Ready agent 5h40m v1.23.8 10.240.0.4 <none> Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS 5.4.0-1085-azure containerd://1.5.11+azure-2 akspoolws000000 Ready agent 3h15m v1.23.8 10.240.0.208 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akspoolws000001 Ready agent 3h17m v1.23.8 10.240.0.239 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akspoolws000002 Ready agent 3h17m v1.23.8 10.240.1.14 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000000 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.115 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000001 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.146 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000002 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.177 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure`

Apply the updated YAML file to the existing workload using the

`kubectl apply`

command and specify the name of the YAML file.`kubectl apply -f <filename>`

The following example output shows a

*configured*status for the deployment:`deployment.apps/sample configured service/sample unchanged`

At this point, AKS starts the process of terminating the existing pods and deploying new pods to the nodes with the

`nodeSelector`

annotation.Check the status of the deployment using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the pods in the

`default`

namespace:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES sample-7794bfcc4c-k62cq 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.238 akspoolws000000 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-rswq9 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.1.10 akspoolws000001 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-sh78c 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.228 akspoolws000000 <none> <none>`


## Security and authentication considerations

If you're using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), you need to update the Managed Identity configuration for the new node pool. gMSA uses a secret (user account and password) so the node that runs the Windows pod can authenticate the container against Microsoft Entra ID. To access that secret on Azure Key Vault, the node uses a Managed Identity that allows the node to access the resource. Since Managed Identities are configured per node pool, and the pod now resides on a new node pool, you need to update that configuration. For more information, see [Enable Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for your Windows Server nodes on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-group-managed-service-accounts).

The same principle applies to Managed Identities for any other pod or node pool when accessing other Azure resources. You need to update any access that Managed Identity provides to reflect the new node pool. To view update and sign-in activities, see [How to view Managed Identity activity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-view-managed-identity-activity).

# Use Image Integrity to validate signed images before deploying them to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and its underlying container model provide increased scalability and manageability for cloud native applications. With AKS, you can launch flexible software applications according to the runtime needs of your system. However, this flexibility can introduce new challenges.

In these application environments, using signed container images helps verify that your deployments are built from a trusted entity and that images haven't been tampered with since their creation. Image Integrity is a service that allows you to add an Azure Policy built-in definition to verify that only signed images are deployed to your AKS clusters.

Note

Image Integrity is a feature based on [Ratify](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify). On an AKS cluster, the feature name and property name is `ImageIntegrity`

, while the relevant Image Integrity pods' names contain `Ratify`

.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).`aks-preview`

CLI extension version 0.5.96 or later.Ensure that the Azure Policy add-on for AKS is enabled on your cluster. If you don't have this add-on installed, see

[Install Azure Policy add-on for AKS](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks).An AKS cluster enabled with OIDC Issuer. To create a new cluster or update an existing cluster, see

[Configure an AKS cluster with OIDC Issuer](use-oidc-issuer).The

`EnableImageIntegrityPreview`

feature flags registered on your Azure subscription. Register the feature flags using the following commands:Register the

`EnableImageIntegrityPreview`

feature flags using thecommand.`az feature register`

`# Register the EnableImageIntegrityPreview feature flag az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnableImageIntegrityPreview" It may take a few minutes for the status to show as *Registered*.`

Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`# Verify the EnableImageIntegrityPreview feature flag registration status az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnableImageIntegrityPreview"`

Once the status shows

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Considerations and limitations

- Your AKS clusters must run Kubernetes version 1.26 or above.
- You shouldn't use this feature for production Azure Container Registry (ACR) registries or workloads.
- Image Integrity supports a maximum of 200 unique signatures concurrently cluster-wide.
- Notation is the only supported verifier.
- Audit is the only supported verification policy effect.

## How Image Integrity works

Image Integrity uses Ratify, Azure Policy, and Gatekeeper to validate signed images before deploying them to your AKS clusters. Enabling Image Integrity on your cluster deploys a `Ratify`

pod. This `Ratify`

pod performs the following tasks:

- Reconciles certificates from Azure Key Vault per the configuration you set up through
`Ratify`

CRDs. - Accesses images stored in ACR when validation requests come from
[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes). To enable this experience, Azure Policy extends Gatekeeper, an admission controller webhook for[Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). - Determines whether the target image is signed with a trusted cert and therefore considered as
*trusted*. `AzurePolicy`

and`Gatekeeper`

consume the validation results as the compliance state to decide whether to allow the deployment request.

## Enable Image Integrity on your AKS cluster

Note

Image signature verification is a governance-oriented scenario and leverages [Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) to verify image signatures on AKS clusters at-scale. We recommend using AKS's Image Integrity built-in Azure Policy initiative, which is available in [Azure Policy's built-in definition library](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#kubernetes).

Create a policy assignment with the AKS policy initiative

using the`[Preview]: Use Image Integrity to ensure only trusted images are deployed`

command.`az policy assignment create`

`export SCOPE="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}" export LOCATION=$(az group show --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --query location -o tsv) az policy assignment create --name 'deploy-trustedimages' --policy-set-definition 'af28bf8b-c669-4dd3-9137-1e68fdc61bd6' --display-name 'Audit deployment with unsigned container images' --scope ${SCOPE} --mi-system-assigned --role Contributor --identity-scope ${SCOPE} --location ${LOCATION}`

The

`Ratify`

pod deploys after you enable the feature.

Note

The policy deploys the Image Integrity feature on your cluster when it detects any update operation on the cluster. If you want to enable the feature immediately, you need to create a policy remediation using the [ az policy remediation create](/en-us/cli/azure/policy/remediation#az-policy-remediation-create) command.

```
assignment_id=$(az policy assignment show --name 'deploy-trustedimages' --scope ${SCOPE} --query id -o tsv)
az policy remediation create --policy-assignment "$assignment_id" --definition-reference-id deployAKSImageIntegrity --name remediation --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```


## Set up verification configurations

For Image Integrity to properly verify the target signed image, you need to set up `Ratify`

configurations through K8s [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) using `kubectl`

.

In this article, we use a self-signed CA cert from the official Ratify documentation to set up verification configurations. For more examples, see [Ratify CRDs](https://ratify.dev/docs/1.0/ratify-configuration).

Create a

`VerifyConfig`

file named`verify-config.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: KeyManagementProvider metadata: name: certstore-inline spec: provider: inline parameters: value: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDQzCCAiugAwIBAgIUDxHQ9JxxmnrLWTA5rAtIZCzY8mMwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQAwKTEPMA0GA1UECgwGUmF0aWZ5MRYwFAYDVQQDDA1SYXRpZnkgU2FtcGxlMB4X DTIzMDYyOTA1MjgzMloXDTMzMDYyNjA1MjgzMlowKTEPMA0GA1UECgwGUmF0aWZ5 MRYwFAYDVQQDDA1SYXRpZnkgU2FtcGxlMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A MIIBCgKCAQEAshmsL2VM9ojhgTVUUuEsZro9jfI27VKZJ4naWSHJihmOki7IoZS8 3/3ATpkE1lGbduJ77M9UxQbEW1PnESB0bWtMQtjIbser3mFCn15yz4nBXiTIu/K4 FYv6HVdc6/cds3jgfEFNw/8RVMBUGNUiSEWa1lV1zDM2v/8GekUr6SNvMyqtY8oo ItwxfUvlhgMNlLgd96mVnnPVLmPkCmXFN9iBMhSce6sn6P9oDIB+pr1ZpE4F5bwa gRBg2tWN3Tz9H/z2a51Xbn7hCT5OLBRlkorHJl2HKKRoXz1hBgR8xOL+zRySH9Qo 3yx6WvluYDNfVbCREzKJf9fFiQeVe0EJOwIDAQABo2MwYTAdBgNVHQ4EFgQUKzci EKCDwPBn4I1YZ+sDdnxEir4wHwYDVR0jBBgwFoAUKzciEKCDwPBn4I1YZ+sDdnxE ir4wDwYDVR0TAQH/BAUwAwEB/zAOBgNVHQ8BAf8EBAMCAgQwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQADggEBAGh6duwc1MvV+PUYvIkDfgj158KtYX+bv4PmcV/aemQUoArqM1ECYFjt BlBVmTRJA0lijU5I0oZje80zW7P8M8pra0BM6x3cPnh/oZGrsuMizd4h5b5TnwuJ hRvKFFUVeHn9kORbyQwRQ5SpL8cRGyYp+T6ncEmo0jdIOM5dgfdhwHgb+i3TejcF 90sUs65zovUjv1wa11SqOdu12cCj/MYp+H8j2lpaLL2t0cbFJlBY6DNJgxr5qync cz8gbXrZmNbzC7W5QK5J7fcx6tlffOpt5cm427f9NiK2tira50HU7gC3HJkbiSTp Xw10iXXMZzSbQ0/Hj2BF4B40WfAkgRg= -----END CERTIFICATE----- --- apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: Store metadata: name: store-oras spec: name: oras # If you want to you use Workload Identity for Ratify to access Azure Container Registry, # uncomment the following lines, and fill the proper ClientID: # See more: https://ratify.dev/docs/reference/oras-auth-provider # parameters: # authProvider: # name: azureWorkloadIdentity # clientID: XXX --- apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: Verifier metadata: name: verifier-notary-inline spec: name: notation artifactTypes: application/vnd.cncf.notary.signature parameters: verificationCertStores: # certificates for validating signatures certs: # name of the trustStore - certstore-inline # name of the certificate store CRD to include in this trustStore trustPolicyDoc: # policy language that indicates which identities are trusted to produce artifacts version: "1.0" trustPolicies: - name: default registryScopes: - "*" signatureVerification: level: strict trustStores: - ca:certs trustedIdentities: - "*"`

Apply the

`VerifyConfig`

to your cluster using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f verify-config.yaml`


## Deploy sample images to your AKS cluster

Deploy a signed image using the

`kubectl run demo`

command.`kubectl run demo-signed --image=ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:signed`

The following example output shows that Image Integrity allows the deployment:

`ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:signed pod/demo-signed created`


If you want to use your own images, see the [guidance for image signing](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-sign-build-push).

## Disable Image Integrity

### Remove policy initiative

First you should remove the policy initiative using the

command.`az policy assignment delete`

`az policy assignment delete --name 'deploy-trustedimages'`


### Diable add-on

Then disable Image Integrity add-on on your cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-image-integrity`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name MyManagedCluster --disable-image-integrity`
