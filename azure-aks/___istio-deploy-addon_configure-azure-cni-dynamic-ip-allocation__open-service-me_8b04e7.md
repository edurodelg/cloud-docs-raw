# Deploy Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to install the Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

For more information on Istio and the service mesh add-on, see [Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service](istio-about).

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to help deploy Istio to your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#install-and-work-with-istio).

## Before you begin

The add-on requires Azure CLI version 2.57.0 or later installed. You can run

`az --version`

to verify version. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).To find information about which Istio add-on revisions are available in a region and their compatibility with AKS standard and LTS cluster versions, use the command

:`az aks mesh get-revisions`

`az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table`

For more information on the Istio add-on's compatibility with AKS, refer to the

[compatibility support policy](istio-support-policy#aks-compatibility).In some cases, Istio CRDs from previous installations may not be automatically cleaned up on uninstall. Ensure existing Istio CRDs are deleted:

`kubectl delete crd $(kubectl get crd -A | grep "istio.io" | awk '{print $1}')`

It is recommended to also clean up other resources from self-managed installations of Istio such as ClusterRoles, MutatingWebhookConfigurations and ValidatingWebhookConfigurations.

Note that if you choose to use any

`istioctl`

CLI commands, you will need to include a flag to point to the add-on installation of Istio:`--istioNamespace aks-istio-system`


### Set environment variables

```
export CLUSTER=<cluster-name>
export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name>
export LOCATION=<location>
```


## Install Istio add-on

This section includes steps to install the Istio add-on during cluster creation or enable for an existing cluster using the Azure CLI. If you want to install the add-on using Bicep, see the guide for [installing an AKS cluster with the Istio service mesh add-on using Bicep](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-istio-addon-bicep). To learn more about the Bicep resource definition for an AKS cluster, see [Bicep managedCluster reference](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters).

Note

If you need the `istiod`

and ingress/egress gateway pods scheduled onto particular nodes, you can use [AKS system nodes](/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools) or the `azureservicemesh/istio.replica.preferred`

node label. The pods have node affinities with a weighted preference of `100`

for AKS system nodes (labeled `kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system`

), and a weighted preference of `50`

for nodes labeled `azureservicemesh/istio.replica.preferred: true`

.

### Revision selection

If you enable the add-on without specifying a revision, a default supported revision is installed for you.

To specify a revision, perform the following steps.

- Use the
command to check which revisions are available for different AKS cluster versions in a region.`az aks mesh get-revisions`

- Based on the available revisions, you can include the
`--revision asm-X-Y`

(ex:`--revision asm-1-24`

) flag in the enable command you use for mesh installation.

### Install mesh during cluster creation

To install the Istio add-on when creating the cluster, use the `--enable-azure-service-mesh`

or`--enable-asm`

parameter.

```
az group create --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --location ${LOCATION}
az aks create \
--resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
--name ${CLUSTER} \
--enable-asm \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Install mesh for existing cluster

The following example enables Istio add-on for an existing AKS cluster:

Important

You can't enable the Istio add-on on an existing cluster if an Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on is already on your cluster. Uninstall the OSM add-on before installing the Istio add-on.
For more information, see [uninstall the OSM add-on from your AKS cluster](open-service-mesh-uninstall-add-on).
Istio add-on can only be enabled on AKS clusters of version >= 1.23.

```
az aks mesh enable --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


## Verify successful installation

To verify the Istio add-on is installed on your cluster, run the following command:

```
az aks show --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER} --query 'serviceMeshProfile.mode'
```


Confirm the output shows `Istio`

.

Use `az aks get-credentials`

to get the credentials for your AKS cluster:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


Use `kubectl`

to verify that `istiod`

(Istio control plane) pods are running successfully:

```
kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-system
```


Confirm the `istiod`

pod has a status of `Running`

. For example:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
istiod-asm-1-24-74f7f7c46c-xfdtl 1/1 Running 0 2m
istiod-asm-1-24-74f7f7c46c-4nt2v 1/1 Running 0 2m
```


## Enable sidecar injection

To automatically install sidecar to any new pods, you need to annotate your namespaces with the revision label corresponding to the control plane revision currently installed.

If you're unsure which revision is installed, use:

```
az aks show --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER} --query 'serviceMeshProfile.istio.revisions'
```


Apply the revision label:

```
kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-X-Y
```


Important

Explicit versioning matching the control plane revision (ex: `istio.io/rev=asm-1-24`

) is required.

The default `istio-injection=enabled`

label will not work and will **cause the sidecar injection to skip the namespace** for the add-on.

For manual injection of sidecar using `istioctl kube-inject`

, you need to specify extra parameters for `istioNamespace`

(`-i`

) and `revision`

(`-r`

). For example:

```
kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f sample.yaml -i aks-istio-system -r asm-X-Y) -n foo
```


## Trigger sidecar injection

You can either deploy the sample application provided for testing, or trigger sidecar injection for existing workloads.

### Existing applications

If you have existing applications to be added to the mesh, ensure their namespaces are labeled as in the previous step, and then restart their deployments to trigger sidecar injection:

```
kubectl rollout restart -n <namespace> <deployment name>
```


Verify that sidecar injection succeeded by ensuring all containers are ready and looking for the `istio-proxy`

container in the `kubectl describe`

output, for example:

```
kubectl describe pod -n namespace <pod name>
```


The `istio-proxy`

container is the Envoy sidecar. Your application is now part of the data plane.

### Deploy sample application

Use `kubectl apply`

to deploy the sample application on the cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.24/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```


Note

Clusters using an HTTP proxy for outbound internet access will need to set up a Service Entry. For setup instructions see [HTTP proxy support in Azure Kubernetes Service](http-proxy)

Confirm several deployments and services are created on your cluster. For example:

```
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
```


Use `kubectl get services`

to verify that the services were created successfully:

```
kubectl get services
```


Confirm the following services were deployed:

```
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
details ClusterIP 10.0.180.193 <none> 9080/TCP 87s
kubernetes ClusterIP 10.0.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 15m
productpage ClusterIP 10.0.112.238 <none> 9080/TCP 86s
ratings ClusterIP 10.0.15.201 <none> 9080/TCP 86s
reviews ClusterIP 10.0.73.95 <none> 9080/TCP 86s
```


```
kubectl get pods
```


```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
details-v1-558b8b4b76-2llld 2/2 Running 0 2m41s
productpage-v1-6987489c74-lpkgl 2/2 Running 0 2m40s
ratings-v1-7dc98c7588-vzftc 2/2 Running 0 2m41s
reviews-v1-7f99cc4496-gdxfn 2/2 Running 0 2m41s
reviews-v2-7d79d5bd5d-8zzqd 2/2 Running 0 2m41s
reviews-v3-7dbcdcbc56-m8dph 2/2 Running 0 2m41s
```


Confirm that all the pods have status of `Running`

with two containers in the `READY`

column. The second container (`istio-proxy`

) added to each pod is the Envoy sidecar injected by Istio, and the other is the application container.

To test this sample application against ingress, check out [next-steps](#next-steps).

# Configure Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

A drawback with the traditional CNI is the exhaustion of pod IP addresses as the AKS cluster grows, which results in the need to rebuild your entire cluster in a bigger subnet. The new dynamic IP allocation capability in Azure CNI solves this problem by allocating pod IPs from a subnet separate from the subnet hosting the AKS cluster.

It offers the following benefits:

**Better IP utilization**: IPs are dynamically allocated to cluster Pods from the Pod subnet. This leads to better utilization of IPs in the cluster compared to the traditional CNI solution, which does static allocation of IPs for every node.**Scalable and flexible**: Node and pod subnets can be scaled independently. A single pod subnet can be shared across multiple node pools of a cluster or across multiple AKS clusters deployed in the same VNet. You can also configure a separate pod subnet for a node pool.**High performance**: Since pods are assigned virtual network IPs, they have direct connectivity to other cluster pod and resources in the VNet. The solution supports very large clusters without any degradation in performance.**Separate VNet policies for pods**: Since pods have a separate subnet, you can configure separate VNet policies for them that are different from node policies. This enables many useful scenarios such as allowing internet connectivity only for pods and not for nodes, fixing the source IP for pod in a node pool using an Azure NAT Gateway, and using NSGs to filter traffic between node pools.**Kubernetes network policies**: Both the Azure Network Policies and Calico work with this new solution.

This article shows you how to use Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support in AKS.

## Prerequisites

Review the

[prerequisites](configure-azure-cni#prerequisites)for configuring basic Azure CNI networking in AKS, as the same prerequisites apply to this article.Review the

[deployment parameters](azure-cni-overview#deployment-parameters)for configuring basic Azure CNI networking in AKS, as the same parameters apply.AKS Engine and DIY clusters aren't supported.

Azure CLI version

`2.37.0`

or later.If you have an existing cluster, you need to enable Container Insights for monitoring IP subnet usage. You can enable Container Insights using the

command, as shown in the following example:`az aks enable-addons`

`az aks enable-addons --addons monitoring --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`


## Plan IP addressing

Planning your IP addressing is much simpler with this feature. Since the nodes and pods scale independently, their address spaces can also be planned separately. Since pod subnets can be configured to the granularity of a node pool, you can always add a new subnet when you add a node pool. The system pods in a cluster/node pool also receive IPs from the pod subnet, so this behavior needs to be accounted for.

IPs are allocated to nodes in batches of 16. Pod subnet IP allocation should be planned with a minimum of 16 IPs per node in the cluster; nodes will request 16 IPs on startup and will request another batch of 16 any time there are <8 IPs unallocated in their allotment.

The planning of IPs for Kubernetes services and Docker bridge remain unchanged.

To view and verify the NodeNetworkConfiguration (NNC) resources responsible for these IP allocations, you can run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodenetworkconfigs -n kube-system -o wide
```


## Maximum pods per node in a cluster with Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support

The pods per node value when using Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation is slightly different from the traditional CNI behavior:

| CNI | Default | Configurable at deployment |
|---|---|---|
| Traditional Azure CNI | 30 | Yes (up to 250) |
| Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation | 250 | Yes (up to 250) |

All other guidance related to configuring the maximum pods per node remains the same.

## Deployment parameters

The [deployment parameters](azure-cni-overview#deployment-parameters)for configuring basic Azure CNI networking in AKS are all valid, with two exceptions:

- The
**subnet**parameter now refers to the subnet related to the cluster's nodes. - An additional parameter
**pod subnet**is used to specify the subnet whose IP addresses will be dynamically allocated to pods.

## Configure Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support - Azure CLI

Using Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support in your cluster is similar to the default method for configuring a cluster Azure CNI. The following example walks through creating a new virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods, and creating a cluster that uses Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support. Be sure to replace variables such as `$subscription`

with your own values.

Create the virtual network with two subnets.

```
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="myResourceGroup"
VNET_NAME="myVirtualNetwork"
LOCATION="westcentralus"
SUBNET_NAME_1="nodesubnet"
SUBNET_NAME_2="podsubnet"
# Create the resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION
# Create our two subnet network
az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION --name $VNET_NAME --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $SUBNET_NAME_1 --address-prefixes 10.240.0.0/16 -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $SUBNET_NAME_2 --address-prefixes 10.241.0.0/16 -o none
```


Create the cluster, referencing the node subnet using `--vnet-subnet-id`

and the pod subnet using `--pod-subnet-id`

and enabling the monitoring add-on.

```
CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster"
SUBSCRIPTION="aaaaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaaa-aaaa"
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--location $LOCATION \
--max-pods 250 \
--node-count 2 \
--network-plugin azure \
--vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME_1 \
--pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME_2 \
--enable-addons monitoring \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Adding node pool

When adding node pool, reference the node subnet using `--vnet-subnet-id`

and the pod subnet using `--pod-subnet-id`

. The following example creates two new subnets that are then referenced in the creation of a new node pool:

```
SUBNET_NAME_3="node2subnet"
SUBNET_NAME_4="pod2subnet"
NODE_POOL_NAME="mynodepool"
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $SUBNET_NAME_3 --address-prefixes 10.242.0.0/16 -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $SUBNET_NAME_4 --address-prefixes 10.243.0.0/16 -o none
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--max-pods 250 \
--node-count 2 \
--vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME_3 \
--pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/$VNET_NAME/subnets/$SUBNET_NAME_4 \
--no-wait
```


## Monitor IP subnet usage

Azure CNI provides the capability to monitor IP subnet usage. To enable IP subnet usage monitoring, follow the steps below:

### Get the YAML file

Download or grep the file named container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml from

[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Docker-Provider/ci_prod/kubernetes/container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml).Find

in integrations. Set`azure_subnet_ip_usage`

`enabled`

to`true`

.Save the file.


### Get the AKS credentials

Set the variables for subscription, resource group and cluster. Consider the following as examples:

```
az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```


### Apply the config

- Open the terminal in the folder in which the downloaded
**container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml**file is saved. - Apply the config using the
`kubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml`

command. This will restart the pod and after 5-10 minutes, the metrics will be visible. - View the metrics on the cluster by navigating to Workbooks on the cluster page in the Azure portal, and find the workbook named
*Subnet IP Usage*.

## Azure CNI Pod Subnet - Dynamic IP Allocation and enhanced subnet support FAQs

**Can I assign multiple pod subnets to a cluster/node pool?**Only one subnet can be assigned to a cluster or node pool. However, multiple clusters or node pools can share a single subnet.

**Can I assign Pod subnets from a different VNet altogether?**No, the pod subnet should be from the same VNet as the cluster.

**Can some node pools in a cluster use the traditional CNI while others use the new CNI?**The entire cluster should use only one type of CNI.

# Deploy the Open Service Mesh add-on using Bicep in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to deploy the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using a [Bicep](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) template.

Note

With the retirement of [Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), we recommend identifying your OSM configurations and migrating them to an equivalent Istio configuration. For information about migrating from OSM to Istio, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

Important

Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.

| Kubernetes version | OSM version installed |
|---|---|
| 1.24.0 or greater | 1.2.5 |
| Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3 |
| Below 1.23.5 | 1.0.0 |

Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

[Bicep](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) is a domain-specific language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. You can use Bicep in place of creating [Azure Resource Manager templates](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) to deploy your infrastructure-as-code Azure resources.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- The Azure CLI version 2.20.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An SSH public key used for deploying AKS. For more information, see
[Create SSH keys using the Azure CLI](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ssh-keys-azure-cli). [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)with a Bash terminal.- The Visual Studio Code
[Bicep extension](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install).

## Install the OSM add-on for a new AKS cluster by using Bicep

For deployment of a new AKS cluster, you enable the OSM add-on at cluster creation. The following instructions use a generic Bicep template that deploys an AKS cluster by using ephemeral disks and the [ kubenet](configure-kubenet) container network interface, and then enables the OSM add-on. For more advanced deployment scenarios, see

[What is Bicep?](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview)

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name <my-osm-bicep-aks-cluster-rg> --location <azure-region>`


### Create the main and parameters Bicep files

Create a directory to store the necessary Bicep deployment files. The following example creates a directory named

*bicep-osm-aks-addon*and changes to the directory:`mkdir bicep-osm-aks-addon cd bicep-osm-aks-addon`

Create the main file and the parameters file.

`touch osm.aks.bicep && touch osm.aks.parameters.json`

Open the

*osm.aks.bicep*file and copy in the following content:`// https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/troubleshooting#what-naming-restrictions-are-enforced-for-aks-resources-and-parameters @minLength(3) @maxLength(63) @description('Provide a name for the AKS cluster. The only allowed characters are letters, numbers, dashes, and underscore. The first and last character must be a letter or a number.') param clusterName string @minLength(3) @maxLength(54) @description('Provide a name for the AKS dnsPrefix. Valid characters include alphanumeric values and hyphens (-). The dnsPrefix can\'t include special characters such as a period (.)') param clusterDNSPrefix string param k8Version string param sshPubKey string param location string param adminUsername string resource aksCluster 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters@2021-03-01' = { name: clusterName location: location identity: { type: 'SystemAssigned' } properties: { kubernetesVersion: k8Version dnsPrefix: clusterDNSPrefix enableRBAC: true agentPoolProfiles: [ { name: 'agentpool' count: 3 vmSize: 'Standard_DS2_v2' osDiskSizeGB: 30 osDiskType: 'Ephemeral' osType: 'Linux' mode: 'System' } ] linuxProfile: { adminUsername: adminUserName ssh: { publicKeys: [ { keyData: sshPubKey } ] } } addonProfiles: { openServiceMesh: { enabled: true config: {} } } } }`

Open the

*osm.aks.parameters.json*file and copy in the following content. Make sure you replace the deployment parameter values with your own values.Note

The

*osm.aks.parameters.json*file is an example template parameters file needed for the Bicep deployment. Update the parameters specifically for your deployment environment. The parameters you need to add values for include:`clusterName`

,`clusterDNSPrefix`

,`k8Version`

,`sshPubKey`

,`location`

, and`adminUsername`

. To find a list of supported Kubernetes versions in your region, use the`az aks get-versions --location <region>`

command.`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "parameters": { "clusterName": { "value": "<YOUR CLUSTER NAME HERE>" }, "clusterDNSPrefix": { "value": "<YOUR CLUSTER DNS PREFIX HERE>" }, "k8Version": { "value": "<YOUR SUPPORTED KUBERNETES VERSION HERE>" }, "sshPubKey": { "value": "<YOUR SSH KEY HERE>" }, "location": { "value": "<YOUR AZURE REGION HERE>" }, "adminUsername": { "value": "<YOUR ADMIN USERNAME HERE>" } } }`


### Deploy the Bicep files

Open a terminal and authenticate to your Azure account for the Azure CLI using the

`az login`

command.Deploy the Bicep files using the

command.`az deployment group create`

`az deployment group create \ --name OSMBicepDeployment \ --resource-group osm-bicep-test \ --template-file osm.aks.bicep \ --parameters @osm.aks.parameters.json`


## Validate installation of the OSM add-on

Query the add-on profiles of the cluster to check the enabled state of the installed add-ons. The following command should return

`true`

:`az aks list -g <my-osm-aks-cluster-rg> -o json | jq -r '.[].addonProfiles.openServiceMesh.enabled'`

Get the status of the

*osm-controller*using the following`kubectl`

commands.`kubectl get deployments -n kube-system --selector app=osm-controller kubectl get pods -n kube-system --selector app=osm-controller kubectl get services -n kube-system --selector app=osm-controller`


## Access the OSM add-on configuration

You can configure the OSM controller using the OSM MeshConfig resource, and you can view the OSM controller's configuration settings using the Azure CLI.

View the OSM controller's configuration settings using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get meshconfig osm-mesh-config -n kube-system -o yaml`

Here's an example output of MeshConfig:

`apiVersion: config.openservicemesh.io/v1alpha1 kind: MeshConfig metadata: creationTimestamp: "0000-00-00A00:00:00A" generation: 1 name: osm-mesh-config namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "2494" uid: 6c4d67f3-c241-4aeb-bf4f-b029b08faa31 spec: certificate: serviceCertValidityDuration: 24h featureFlags: enableEgressPolicy: true enableMulticlusterMode: false enableWASMStats: true observability: enableDebugServer: true osmLogLevel: info tracing: address: jaeger.osm-system.svc.cluster.local enable: false endpoint: /api/v2/spans port: 9411 sidecar: configResyncInterval: 0s enablePrivilegedInitContainer: false envoyImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/envoyproxy/envoy:v1.18.3 initContainerImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/openservicemesh/init:v0.9.1 logLevel: error maxDataPlaneConnections: 0 resources: {} traffic: enableEgress: true enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode: true inboundExternalAuthorization: enable: false failureModeAllow: false statPrefix: inboundExtAuthz timeout: 1s useHTTPSIngress: false`

Notice that

`enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode`

is configured to`true`

. In OSM, permissive traffic policy mode bypasses[SMI](https://smi-spec.io/)traffic policy enforcement. In this mode, OSM automatically discovers services that are a part of the service mesh. The discovered services will have traffic policy rules programmed on each Envoy proxy sidecar to allow communications between these services.Warning

Before you proceed, verify that your permissive traffic policy mode is set to

`true`

. If it isn't, change it to`true`

using the following command:`kubectl patch meshconfig osm-mesh-config -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode":true}}}' --type=merge`


## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the Azure resources, delete the deployment's test resource group using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name osm-bicep-test`

Alternatively, you can uninstall the OSM add-on and the related resources from your cluster. For more information, see

[Uninstall the Open Service Mesh add-on from your AKS cluster](open-service-mesh-uninstall-add-on).

Note

If you have an existing cluster with any of the above features enabled, you might not be able to add a node pool using Flatcar Container Linux.

## Get started with Flatcar Container Linux for AKS

To get started using the Flatcar Container Linux for AKS, see the following resources:

- Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-flatcar-deploy-cli) - Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) using an
[ARM template](learn/quick-flatcar-deploy-arm-template) - Create an AKS cluster with a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool using
[Azure CLI or an ARM template](create-node-pools) - Add a Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool to an existing cluster using
[Azure CLI or an ARM template](create-node-pools)

## OS migrations and upgrades with Flatcar Container Linux

AKS doesn't support in-place migrations from existing Linux clusters or node pools to Flatcar Container Linux clusters or node pools. To migrate existing workloads to Flatcar Container Linux for AKS, you need to recreate your node pools using `--os-sku flatcar`

.

Flatcar Container Linux for AKS releases weekly AKS node images. Versioning follows the AKS date-based format (for example: 202506.13.0). You can check the node images in the release notes and by using the [ az aks nodepool list](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-list) command to view the

`nodeImageVersion`

. For example:```
az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <aks-cluster-name> --query '[].{name: name, nodeImageVersion: nodeImageVersion}'
```


Example output:

```
[
{
"name": "nodes",
"nodeImageVersion": "AKSFlatcar-flatcargen2-202508.06.0"
}
]
```


You can check the Flatcar version number (for example: Flatcar 4372.0.1) in the release notes and by using `kubectl get nodes`

command. For example:

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```


Example output:

```
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION INTERNAL-IP EXTERNAL-IP OS-IMAGE KERNEL-VERSION CONTAINER-RUNTIME
aks-nodes-16363508-vmss000000 Ready <none> 2m33s v1.32.6 10.224.0.4 <none> Flatcar Container Linux by Kinvolk 4372.0.1 (Oklo) 6.12.35-flatcar containerd://2.0.4
```


Flatcar's inbuilt automatic A/B update for the OS partition is disabled and only full node image updates are supported.

# Observability for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to view observability metrics and improve observability for AKS clusters with KMS etcd encryption.

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with KMS etcd encryption enabled. For more information, see
[Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-kms-etcd-encryption). - You must enable
[diagnostic settings for the key vault to check the encryption logs](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/howto-logging).

## Check the KMS config

Get the KMS config using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "securityProfile.azureKeyVaultKms"`

The output looks similar to the following example output:

`... "securityProfile": { "azureKeyVaultKms": { "enabled": true, "keyId": "https://<key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net/keys/<key-name>/<key-id>", "keyVaultNetworkAccess": "Public", "keyVaultResourceId": <key-vault-resource-id> ...`


## Diagnose and solve problems

Because the KMS plugin is a sidecar of `kube-apiserver`

pod, you can't access it directly. To improve the observability of KMS, you can check the KMS status using the Azure portal.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster.
- From the service menu, select
**Diagnose and solve problems**. - In the search bar, search for
**KMS**and select**Azure KeyVault KMS Integration Issues**.

### Example problem

Let's say you see the following issue: `KeyExpired: Operation encrypt isn't allowed on an expired key`

.

Because the AKS KMS plugin currently only allows bring your own (BYO) key vault and key, it's your responsibility to manage the key lifecycle. If the key is expired, the KMS plugin fails to decrypt the existing secrets. To resolve this issue, you need to *extend the key expiration date* to make KMS work and *rotate the key version*.

## Next steps

For more information on using KMS with AKS, see the following articles:

# Tutorial - Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As part of the application and cluster lifecycle, you might want to upgrade to the latest available version of Kubernetes. You can upgrade your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal.

In this tutorial, you upgrade an AKS cluster. You learn how to:

- Identify current and available Kubernetes versions.
- Upgrade your Kubernetes nodes.
- Validate a successful upgrade.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you packaged an application into a container image and uploaded the container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR). You also created an AKS cluster and deployed an application to it. If you haven't completed these steps and want to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app).

If using Azure CLI, this tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

If using Azure PowerShell, this tutorial requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Run `Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Get available cluster versions

Before you upgrade, check which Kubernetes releases are available for your cluster using the

command.`az aks get-upgrades`

`az aks get-upgrades --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

The following example output shows the current version as

*1.28.9*and lists the available versions under`upgrades`

:`{ "agentPoolProfiles": null, "controlPlaneProfile": { "kubernetesVersion": "1.28.9", ... "upgrades": [ { "isPreview": null, "kubernetesVersion": "1.29.4" }, { "isPreview": null, "kubernetesVersion": "1.29.2" } ] }, ... }`


## Upgrade an AKS cluster

AKS nodes are carefully cordoned and drained to minimize any potential disruptions to running applications. During this process, AKS performs the following steps:

- Adds a new buffer node (or as many nodes as configured in
[max surge](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade)) to the cluster that runs the specified Kubernetes version. [Cordons and drains](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)one of the old nodes to minimize disruption to running applications. If you're using max surge, it[cordons and drains](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/)as many nodes at the same time as the number of buffer nodes specified.- When the old node is fully drained, it's reimaged to receive the new version and becomes the buffer node for the following node to be upgraded.
- This process repeats until all nodes in the cluster have been upgraded.
- At the end of the process, the last buffer node is deleted, maintaining the existing agent node count and zone balance.

Note

If no patch is specified, the cluster automatically upgrades to the specified minor version's latest GA patch. For example, setting `--kubernetes-version`

to `1.28`

results in the cluster upgrading to `1.28.9`

.

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes minor version upgrades in AKS](supported-kubernetes-versions#alias-minor-version).

You can either [manually upgrade your cluster](#manually-upgrade-cluster) or [configure automatic cluster upgrades](#configure-automatic-cluster-upgrades). **We recommend you configure automatic cluster upgrades to ensure your cluster is always running the latest version of Kubernetes**.

### Manually upgrade cluster

Upgrade your cluster using the

command.`az aks upgrade`

`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --kubernetes-version KUBERNETES_VERSION`

You will be prompted to confirm the upgrade operation, and to confirm that you want to upgrade the control plane

*and*all the node pools to the selected version of Kubernetes:`Are you sure you want to perform this operation? (y/N): y Since control-plane-only argument is not specified, this will upgrade the control plane AND all nodepools to version 1.29.2. Continue? (y/N): y`

Note

You can only upgrade one minor version at a time. For example, you can upgrade from

*1.14.x*to*1.15.x*, but you can't upgrade from*1.14.x*to*1.16.x*directly. To upgrade from*1.14.x*to*1.16.x*, you must first upgrade from*1.14.x*to*1.15.x*, then perform another upgrade from*1.15.x*to*1.16.x*.The following example output shows the result of upgrading to

*1.29.2*. Notice the`kubernetesVersion`

now shows*1.29.2*:`{ ... "agentPoolProfiles": [ { ... "count": 3, "currentOrchestratorVersion": "1.29.2", "maxPods": 110, "name": "nodepool1", "nodeImageVersion": "AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202405.27.0", "orchestratorVersion": "1.29.2", "osType": "Linux", "upgradeSettings": { "drainTimeoutInMinutes": null, "maxSurge": "10%", "nodeSoakDurationInMinutes": null, "undrainableNodeBehavior": null }, "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ], ... "currentKubernetesVersion": "1.29.2", "dnsPrefix": "myAKSClust-myResourceGroup-19da35", "enableRbac": false, "fqdn": "myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-bd54a4be.hcp.westus2.azmk8s.io", "id": "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster", "kubernetesVersion": "1.29.2", "location": "westus2", "name": "myAKSCluster", "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters" ... }`


### Configure automatic cluster upgrades

Set an auto-upgrade channel on your cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--auto-upgrade-channel`

parameter set to`patch`

.`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --auto-upgrade-channel patch`


For more information, see [Automatically upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](auto-upgrade-cluster).

#### Upgrade AKS node images

AKS regularly provides new node images. Linux node images are updated weekly, and Windows node images are updated monthly. We recommend upgrading your node images frequently to use the latest AKS features and security updates. For more information, see [Upgrade node images in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](node-image-upgrade). To configure automatic node image upgrades, see [Automatically upgrade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster node operating system images](auto-upgrade-node-image).

## View the upgrade events

Note

When you upgrade your cluster, the following Kubernetes events might occur on the nodes:

**Surge**: Create a surge node.**Drain**: Evict pods from the node. Each pod has a*five minute timeout*to complete the eviction.**Update**: Update of a node has succeeded or failed.**Delete**: Delete a surge node.

View the upgrade events in the default namespaces using the

`kubectl get events`

command.`kubectl get events --field-selector source=upgrader`

The following example output shows some of the above events listed during an upgrade:

`LAST SEEN TYPE REASON OBJECT MESSAGE ... 5m Normal Drain node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 Draining node: aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 5m Normal Upgrade node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 Deleting node aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 from API server 4m Normal Upgrade node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 Successfully reimaged node: aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 4m Normal Upgrade node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 Successfully upgraded node: aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 4m Normal Drain node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 Draining node: aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000000 ...`


## Validate an upgrade

Confirm the upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --output table`

The following example output shows the AKS cluster runs

*KubernetesVersion 1.27.3*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion CurrentKubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- myAKSCluster westus2 myResourceGroup 1.29.2 1.29.2 Succeeded myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-bd54a4be.hcp.westus2.azmk8s.io`


## Delete the cluster

As this tutorial is the last part of the series, you might want to delete your AKS cluster to avoid incurring Azure charges.

Remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait`


Note

When you delete the cluster, the Microsoft Entra service principal used by the AKS cluster isn't removed. For steps on how to remove the service principal, see [AKS service principal considerations and deletion](kubernetes-service-principal#considerations-when-using-a-service-principal). If you used a managed identity, the identity is managed by the platform and doesn't require that you provision or rotate any secrets.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you upgraded Kubernetes in an AKS cluster. You learned how to:

- Identify current and available Kubernetes versions.
- Upgrade your Kubernetes nodes.
- Validate a successful upgrade.

For more information on AKS, see the [AKS overview](intro-kubernetes). For guidance on how to create full solutions with AKS, see the [AKS solution guidance](/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-start-here?WT.mc_id=AKSDOCSPAGE).

# Configure availability zones in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Availability zones](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) help protect your applications and data from datacenter failures. Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone includes one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with availability zones physically distributes resources across different availability zones within a single region, improving reliability. Deploying nodes in multiple zones doesn't incur additional costs. For more information on AKS reliability features including availability zones, multi-region configurations, reliability during service maintenance, and backup, see [Reliability in AKS](/en-us/azure/reliability/reliability-aks).

This article shows you how to configure AKS resources to use availability zones.

## AKS resources

This diagram shows the Azure resources that are created when you create an AKS cluster:

### AKS control plane

Microsoft hosts the [AKS control plane](/en-us/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#control-plane), the Kubernetes API server, and services such as `scheduler`

and `etcd`

as a managed service. Microsoft replicates the control plane in multiple zones.

Other resources of your cluster deploy in a managed resource group in your Azure subscription. By default, this resource group is prefixed with *MC_* for *managed cluster* and contains the resources mentioned in the following sections.

### Node pools

Node pools are created as virtual machine scale sets in your Azure subscription.

When you create an AKS cluster, one [system node pool](/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools) is required and is created automatically. It hosts critical system pods such as `CoreDNS`

and `metrics-server`

. You can add more [user node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/create-node-pools) to your AKS cluster to host your applications.

There are three ways node pools can be deployed:

- Zone-spanning
- Zone-aligned
- Regional

The system node pool zones are configured when the cluster or node pool is created.

#### Zone-spanning

In this configuration, nodes are spread across all selected zones. These zones are specified by using the `--zones`

parameter.

```
# Create an AKS cluster, and create a zone-spanning system node pool in all three AZs, one node in each AZ
az aks create --resource-group example-rg --name example-cluster --node-count 3 --zones 1 2 3
# Add one new zone-spanning user node pool, two nodes in each
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-a --node-count 6 --zones 1 2 3
```


AKS automatically balances the number of nodes between zones.

If a zonal outage occurs, nodes within the affected zone might be affected, but nodes in other availability zones remain unaffected.

To validate node locations, run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name, REGION:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/region, ZONE:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone'
```


```
NAME REGION ZONE
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000000 eastus eastus-1
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000001 eastus eastus-2
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000002 eastus eastus-3
```


#### Zone-aligned

In this configuration, each node is aligned (pinned) to a specific zone. To create three node pools for a region with three availability zones:

```
# # Add three new zone-aligned user node pools, two nodes in each
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-x --node-count 2 --zones 1
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-y --node-count 2 --zones 2
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-z --node-count 2 --zones 3
```


This configuration can be used when you need [lower latency between nodes](/en-us/azure/aks/reduce-latency-ppg). It also provides more granular control over scaling operations, or when you're using the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview).

Note

If a single workload is deployed across node pools, we recommend setting `--balance-similar-node-groups`

to `true`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale-up operations.

#### Regional (not using availability zones)

Regional mode is used when the zone assignment isn't set in the deployment template (for example, `"zones"=[]`

or `"zones"=null`

).

In this configuration, the node pool creates regional (not zone-pinned) instances and implicitly places instances throughout the region. There's no guarantee that instances are balanced or spread across zones, or that instances are in the same availability zone.

In the rare case of a full zonal outage, any or all instances within the node pool might be affected.

To validate node locations, run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name, REGION:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/region, ZONE:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone'
```


```
NAME REGION ZONE
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000000 eastus 0
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000001 eastus 0
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000002 eastus 0
```


## Deployments

### Pods

Kubernetes is aware of Azure availability zones, and can balance pods across nodes in different zones. In the event a zone becomes unavailable, Kubernetes moves pods away from affected nodes automatically.

As documented in the Kubernetes reference [Well-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/), Kubernetes uses the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`

label to automatically distribute pods in a replication controller or service across the various available zones available.

To see which pods and nodes are running, run the following command:

```
kubectl describe pod | grep -e "^Name:" -e "^Node:"
```


The `maxSkew`

parameter describes the degree to which pods might be unevenly distributed. Assuming three zones and three replicas, setting this value to `1`

ensures that each zone has at least one pod running:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: my-deployment
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: my-app
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: my-app
spec:
topologySpreadConstraints:
- maxSkew: 1
topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
app: my-app
containers:
- name: my-container
image: my-image
```


### Storage and volumes

By default, Kubernetes versions 1.29 and later use Azure Managed Disks by using zone-redundant storage for Persistent Volume Claims.

These disks are replicated between zones, to enhance the resilience of your applications. This action helps to safeguard your data against datacenter failures.

The following example shows a Persistent Volume Claim that uses Azure Standard SSD in zone-redundant storage:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteOnce
storageClassName: managed-csi
#storageClassName: managed-csi-premium
resources:
requests:
storage: 5Gi
```


For zone-aligned deployments, you can create a new storage class with the `skuname`

parameter set to `LRS`

(locally redundant storage). You can then use the new storage class in your Persistent Volume Claim.

Although locally redundant storage disks are less expensive, they aren't zone-redundant, and attaching a disk to a node in a different zone isn't supported.

The following example shows a locally redundant storage Standard SSD storage class:

```
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: azuredisk-csi-standard-lrs
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
parameters:
skuname: StandardSSD_LRS
#skuname: PremiumV2_LRS
```


### Load balancers

Kubernetes deploys Azure Standard Load Balancer by default, which balances inbound traffic across all zones in a region. If a node becomes unavailable, the load balancer reroutes traffic to healthy nodes.

An example service that uses Azure Load Balancer:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: example
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
app: myapp
ports:
- port: 80
targetPort: 8080
```


Important

On September 30, 2025, Basic Load Balancer will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). If you use Basic Load Balancer, make sure to [upgrade](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-basic-upgrade-guidance) to Standard Load Balancer before the retirement date.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you're using availability zones:

- See
[Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes). - The number of availability zones used
*can't be changed*after the node pool is created. - Most regions support availability zones.
[See a list of regions](/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration simplifies the Microsoft Entra integration process. Previously, you were required to create a client and server app, and the Microsoft Entra tenant had to assign [Directory Readers](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-readers) role permissions. Now, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resource provider manages the client and server apps for you.

Cluster administrators can configure Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) based on a user's identity or directory group membership. Microsoft Entra authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID Connect, see the [OpenID Connect documentation](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc).

Learn more about the Microsoft Entra integration flow in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](concepts-identity#azure-ad-integration).

## Limitations

The following are constraints to integrate authentication on AKS:

- Integration can't be disabled after being added.
- Downgrades from an integrated cluster to the legacy Microsoft Entra ID clusters aren't supported.
- Clusters without Kubernetes RBAC support are unable to add the integration.

## Before you begin

To install the AKS addon, verify you have the following items:

- You have Azure CLI version 2.29.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need
`kubectl`

with a minimum version of[1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1181)or. With the Azure CLI and the Azure PowerShell module, these two commands are included and automatically managed. Meaning, they're upgraded by default and running`kubelogin`

`az aks install-cli`

isn't required or recommended. If you're using an automated pipeline, you need to manage upgrades for the correct or latest version. The difference between the minor versions of Kubernetes and`kubectl`

shouldn't be more than*one*version. Otherwise, authentication issues occur on the wrong version. - If you're using
[helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), you need a minimum version of helm 3.3. - This configuration requires you have a Microsoft Entra group for your cluster. This group is registered as an admin group on the cluster to grant admin permissions. If you don't have an existing Microsoft Entra group, you can create one using the
command.`az ad group create`


Note

Microsoft Entra integrated clusters using a Kubernetes version newer than version 1.24 automatically use the `kubelogin`

format. Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.24, the default format of the `clusterUser`

credential for Microsoft Entra ID clusters is `exec`

, which requires [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) binary in the execution

`PATH`

. There's no behavior change for non-Microsoft Entra clusters, or Microsoft Entra ID clusters running a version older than 1.24.
Existing downloaded `kubeconfig`

continues to work. An optional query parameter `format`

is included when getting `clusterUser`

credential to overwrite the default behavior change. You can explicitly specify format to `azure`

if you need to maintain the old `kubeconfig`

format.## Enable the integration on your AKS cluster

### Create a new cluster

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location centralus`

Create an AKS cluster and enable administration access for your Microsoft Entra group using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-aad \ --aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> \ --aad-tenant-id <id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`

A successful creation of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body.

`"AADProfile": { "adminGroupObjectIds": [ "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" ], "clientAppId": null, "managed": true, "serverAppId": null, "serverAppSecret": null, "tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee" }`


### Use an existing cluster

Enable AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration on your existing Kubernetes RBAC enabled cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. Make sure to set your admin group to keep access on your cluster.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name myManagedCluster \
--enable-aad \
--aad-admin-group-object-ids <id-1>,<id-2> \
--aad-tenant-id <id>
```


A successful activation of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body:

```
"AADProfile": {
"adminGroupObjectIds": [
"aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
],
"clientAppId": null,
"managed": true,
"serverAppId": null,
"serverAppSecret": null,
"tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
}
```


### Migrate legacy cluster to integration

If your cluster uses legacy Microsoft Entra integration, you can upgrade to AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration through the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

Warning

Free tier clusters might experience API server downtime during the upgrade. We recommend upgrading during your nonbusiness hours.
After the upgrade, the `kubeconfig`

content changes. You need to run `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <AKS resource group name> --name <AKS cluster name>`

to merge the new credentials into the `kubeconfig`

file.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myManagedCluster \
--enable-aad \
--aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> \
--aad-tenant-id <id>
```


A successful migration of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body:

```
"AADProfile": {
"adminGroupObjectIds": [
"aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
],
"clientAppId": null,
"managed": true,
"serverAppId": null,
"serverAppSecret": null,
"tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
}
```


## Access your enabled cluster

Get the user credentials to access your cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster`

Follow your sign in instructions.

Set

`kubelogin`

to use the Azure CLI.`kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli`

View the nodes in the cluster with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`


## Non-interactive sign-in with kubelogin

There are some non-interactive scenarios that don't support `kubectl`

. In these cases, use [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) to connect to the cluster with a non-interactive service principal credential to perform continuous integration pipelines.

Note

Microsoft Entra integrated clusters using a Kubernetes version newer than version 1.24 automatically use the `kubelogin`

format. Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.24, the default format of the `clusterUser`

credential for Microsoft Entra ID clusters is `exec`

, which requires [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) binary in the execution PATH. There's no behavior change for non-Microsoft Entra clusters, or Microsoft Entra ID clusters running a version older than 1.24.
Existing downloaded

`kubeconfig`

continues to work. An optional query parameter `format`

is included when getting `clusterUser`

credential to overwrite the default behavior change. You can explicitly specify format to `azure`

if you need to maintain the old `kubeconfig`

format.When getting the `clusterUser`

credential, you can use the `format`

query parameter to overwrite the default behavior. You can set the value to `azure`

to use the original `kubeconfig`

format:

```
az aks get-credentials --format azure
```


If your Microsoft Entra integrated cluster uses Kubernetes version 1.24 or lower, you need to manually convert the `kubeconfig`

format.

```
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig
```


If you receive the message **error: The Azure auth plugin has been removed.**, you need to run the command `kubelogin convert-kubeconfig`

to convert the `kubeconfig`

format manually. For more information, see [Azure Kubelogin Known Issues](https://azure.github.io/kubelogin/known-issues.html).

## Troubleshoot access issues

Important

The step described in this section suggests an alternative authentication method compared to the normal Microsoft Entra group authentication. Use this option only in an emergency.

If you lack administrative access to a valid Microsoft Entra group, you can follow this workaround. Sign in with an account that is a member of the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-admin-role) role and grant your group or tenant admin credentials to access your cluster.

## Next steps

- Learn about
[Microsoft Entra integration with Kubernetes RBAC](azure-ad-rbac). - Learn more about
[AKS and Kubernetes identity concepts](concepts-identity). - Learn how to
[use kubelogin](kubelogin-authentication)for all supported Microsoft Entra authentication methods in AKS. - Use
[Azure Resource Manager templates](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters)to create AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID enabled clusters.
