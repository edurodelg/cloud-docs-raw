# Best practices for authentication and authorization in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you deploy and maintain clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you implement ways to manage access to resources and services. Without these controls:

- Accounts could have access to unnecessary resources and services.
- Tracking credentials used to make changes can be difficult.

In this article, we discuss what recommended practices a cluster operator can follow to manage access and identity for AKS clusters. You'll learn how to:

- Authenticate AKS cluster users with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Control access to resources with Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC).
- Use Azure RBAC to granularly control access to the AKS resource, the Kubernetes API at scale, and the
`kubeconfig`

. - Use a
[workload identity](workload-identity-overview)to access Azure resources from your pods.

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

## Use Microsoft Entra ID


Best practice guidanceDeploy AKS clusters with

[Microsoft Entra integration]. Using Microsoft Entra ID centralizes the identity management layer. Any change in user account or group status is automatically updated in access to the AKS cluster. Scope users or groups to the minimum permissions amount using[Roles, ClusterRoles, or Bindings].

Your Kubernetes cluster developers and application owners need access to different resources. Kubernetes lacks an identity management solution for you to control the resources with which users can interact. Instead, you can integrate your cluster with an existing identity solution like Microsoft Entra ID, an enterprise-ready identity management solution.

With Microsoft Entra integrated clusters in AKS, you create *Roles* or *ClusterRoles* defining access permissions to resources. You then *bind* the roles to users or groups from Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more about these Kubernetes RBAC in [the next section](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac). Microsoft Entra integration and how you control access to resources can be seen in the following diagram:

- Developer authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID.
- The Microsoft Entra token issuance endpoint issues the access token.
- The developer performs an action using the Microsoft Entra token, such as
`kubectl create pod`

. - Kubernetes validates the token with Microsoft Entra ID and fetches the developer's group memberships.
- Kubernetes RBAC and cluster policies are applied.
- The developer's request is successful based on previous validation of Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC and policies.

To create an AKS cluster that uses Microsoft Entra ID, see [Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](enable-authentication-microsoft-entra-id).

## Use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)


Best practice guidanceDefine user or group permissions to cluster resources with Kubernetes RBAC. Create roles and bindings that assign the least amount of permissions required. Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID to automatically update any user status or group membership change and keep access to cluster resources current.


In Kubernetes, you provide granular access control to cluster resources. You define permissions at the cluster level, or to specific namespaces. You determine what resources can be managed and with what permissions. You then apply these roles to users or groups with a binding. For more information about *Roles*, *ClusterRoles*, and *Bindings*, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity).

For example, you create a role with full access to resources in the namespace named *finance-app*, as shown in the following example YAML manifest:

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role
namespace: finance-app
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
resources: ["*"]
verbs: ["*"]
```


You then create a *RoleBinding* and bind the Microsoft Entra user *developer1@contoso.com* to it, as shown in the following YAML manifest:

```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role-binding
namespace: finance-app
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer1@contoso.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: finance-app-full-access-role
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


When *developer1@contoso.com* is authenticated against the AKS cluster, they have full permissions to resources in the *finance-app* namespace. In this way, you logically separate and control access to resources. Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID-integration.

To learn how to use Microsoft Entra groups to control access to Kubernetes resources using Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using role-based access control and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

## Use Azure RBAC


Best practice guidanceUse Azure RBAC to define the minimum required user and group permissions to AKS resources in one or more subscriptions.


There are two levels of access needed to fully operate an AKS cluster:

Access the AKS resource on your Azure subscription.

This access level allows you to:

- Control scaling or upgrading your cluster using the AKS APIs
- Pull your
`kubeconfig`

.

To learn how to control access to the AKS resource and the

`kubeconfig`

, see[Limit access to cluster configuration file](control-kubeconfig-access).Access to the Kubernetes API.

This access level is controlled either by:

[Kubernetes RBAC](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac)(traditionally) or- By integrating Azure RBAC with AKS for kubernetes authorization.

To learn how to granularly grant permissions to the Kubernetes API using Azure RBAC, see

[Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization](manage-azure-rbac).

## Use pod-managed identities

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

Don't use fixed credentials within pods or container images, as they are at risk of exposure or abuse. Instead, use *pod identities* to automatically request access using Microsoft Entra ID.

To access other Azure resources, like Azure Cosmos DB, Key Vault, or Blob storage, the pod needs authentication credentials. You could define authentication credentials with the container image or inject them as a Kubernetes secret. Either way, you would need to manually create and assign them. Usually, these credentials are reused across pods and aren't regularly rotated.

With pod-managed identities (preview) for Azure resources, you automatically request access to services through Microsoft Entra ID. Pod-managed identities is currently in preview for AKS. Refer to the [Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (Preview)](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) documentation to get started.

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) supports two modes of operation:

**Standard**mode: In this mode, the following 2 components are deployed to the AKS cluster:[Managed Identity Controller(MIC)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/mic/): A Kubernetes controller that watches for changes to pods,[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)through the Kubernetes API Server. When it detects a relevant change, the MIC adds or deletes[AzureAssignedIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureassignedidentity/)as needed. Specifically, when a pod is scheduled, the MIC assigns the managed identity on Azure to the underlying virtual machine scale set used by the node pool during the creation phase. When all pods using the identity are deleted, it removes the identity from the virtual machine scale set of the node pool, unless the same managed identity is used by other pods. The MIC takes similar actions when AzureIdentity or AzureIdentityBinding are created or deleted.[Node Managed Identity (NMI)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/): is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. NMI intercepts security token requests to the[Azure Instance Metadata Service](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/instance-metadata-service?tabs=linux)on each node. It redirects requests to itself and validates if the pod has access to the identity it's requesting a token for, and fetch the token from the Microsoft Entra tenant on behalf of the application.

**Managed**mode: In this mode, there's only NMI. The identity needs to be manually assigned and managed by the user. For more information, see[Pod Identity in Managed Mode](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/configure/pod_identity_in_managed_mode/). In this mode, when you use the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command to add a pod identity to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, it creates the[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)in the namespace specified by the`--namespace`

parameter, while the AKS resource provider assigns the managed identity specified by the`--identity-resource-id`

parameter to virtual machine scale set of each node pool in the AKS cluster.

Note

If you instead decide to install the Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity using the [AKS cluster add-on](use-azure-ad-pod-identity), setup uses the `managed`

mode.

The `managed`

mode provides the following advantages over the `standard`

:

- Identity assignment on the virtual machine scale set of a node pool can take up 40-60s. With cronjobs or applications that require access to the identity and can't tolerate the assignment delay, it's best to use
`managed`

mode as the identity is pre-assigned to the virtual machine scale set of the node pool. Either manually or using the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command. - In
`standard`

mode, MIC requires write permissions on the virtual machine scale set used by the AKS cluster and`Managed Identity Operator`

permission on the user-assigned managed identities. When running in`managed mode`

, since there's no MIC, the role assignments aren't required.

Instead of manually defining credentials for pods, pod-managed identities request an access token in real time, using it to access only their assigned resources. In AKS, there are two components that handle the operations to allow pods to use managed identities:

**The Node Management Identity (NMI) server**is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. The NMI server listens for pod requests to Azure services.**The Azure Resource Provider**queries the Kubernetes API server and checks for an Azure identity mapping that corresponds to a pod.

When pods request a security token from Microsoft Entra ID to access to an Azure resource, network rules redirect the traffic to the NMI server.

The NMI server:

- Identifies pods requesting access to Azure resources based on their remote address.
- Queries the Azure Resource Provider.

The Azure Resource Provider checks for Azure identity mappings in the AKS cluster.

The NMI server requests an access token from Microsoft Entra ID based on the pod's identity mapping.

Microsoft Entra ID provides access to the NMI server, which is returned to the pod.

- This access token can be used by the pod to then request access to resources in Azure.


In the following example, a developer creates a pod that uses a managed identity to request access to Azure SQL Database:

- Cluster operator creates a service account to map identities when pods request access to resources.
- The NMI server is deployed to relay any pod requests, along with the Azure Resource Provider, for access tokens to Microsoft Entra ID.
- A developer deploys a pod with a managed identity that requests an access token through the NMI server.
- The token is returned to the pod and used to access Azure SQL Database

# Stateful workload upgrade patterns

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Upgrade clusters that run databases and stateful applications without data loss by using these proven patterns.

## What this article covers

This article provides database-specific upgrade patterns for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with stateful workloads, such as:

- PostgreSQL Ferris wheel pattern for ~30-second downtime.
- Redis rolling replacement for zero-downtime cache upgrades.
- MongoDB step-down cascades for replica set safety.
- Emergency upgrade checklists for security responses.
- Validation and rollback procedures for data protection.

These patterns are best for use by database administrators for applications with persistent data and mission-critical stateful services.

For more information, see these related articles:

- To upgrade your production AKS clusters, see
[AKS production upgrade strategies](aks-production-upgrade-strategies). - To check for and apply basic upgrades to your AKS cluster, see
[Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster). - To use the scenario hub to help you choose the right AKS upgrade approach, see
[AKS upgrade scenarios: Choose your path](upgrade-scenarios-hub).

For a quick start, select a link for instructions:

[Do you need an emergency upgrade?](#emergency-upgrade-checklist)[Do you need help with a PostgreSQL cluster?](#the-ferris-wheel-pattern-postgresql)[Do you need a Redis cache rolling replace?](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)

## Choose your pattern

| Database type | Upgrade pattern | Downtime | Complexity | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL |
|

[Rolling replace](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)[Step-down cascade](#mongodb-replica-set-step-down)*(coming soon)**(coming soon)*## Emergency upgrade checklist

Do you need to upgrade now because of security issues?

Run the following commands for an immediate safety check (two minutes):

`# Verify all replicas are healthy kubectl get pods -l tier=database -o wide # Check replication lag ./scripts/check-replica-health.sh # Ensure recent backup exists kubectl get job backup-job -o jsonpath='{.status.completionTime}'`

Choose an emergency pattern (one minute):

**PostgreSQL/MySQL:**Use[Ferris wheel](#the-ferris-wheel-pattern-postgresql)(30-second downtime).**Redis/Memcached:**Use[Rolling replace](#redis-cluster-rolling-replace)(zero downtime).**MongoDB/CouchDB:**Use[Step-down cascade](#mongodb-replica-set-step-down)(10-second downtime).

Run with a safety net (15-minute to 30-minute window):

- Always test rollback procedures in advance.
- Monitor application metrics during the upgrade.
- Keep the database team on standby.


## The Ferris wheel pattern: PostgreSQL

This pattern is best for 3-node PostgreSQL clusters with primary/replica setup across availability zones.

Visual pattern:

```
Initial: [PRIMARY] [REPLICA-1] [REPLICA-2]
Step 1: [PRIMARY] [REPLICA-1] [NEW-NODE] ← Add new node
Step 2: [REPLICA-1] [NEW-NODE] [REPLICA-2] ← Promote & remove old primary
Step 3: [NEW-PRIMARY] [NEW-NODE] [REPLICA-2] ← Complete rotation
```


### Quick implementation (20 minutes)

```
# 1. Add new node to cluster
kubectl scale statefulset postgres-cluster --replicas=4
# 2. Wait for new replica to sync
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-cluster-3 --timeout=300s
# 3. Promote new primary and failover (30-second downtime window)
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# 4. Update service endpoint
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"app":"postgres-cluster","role":"primary","pod":"postgres-cluster-3"}}}'
# 5. Remove old primary node
kubectl delete pod postgres-cluster-0
```


**Detailed step-by-step guide**

#### Prerequisites validation

```
#!/bin/bash
# pre-upgrade-validation.sh
echo "=== PostgreSQL Cluster Health Check ==="
# Check replication status
kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Verify sync replication (must show 'sync' state)
SYNC_COUNT=$(kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -t -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_replication WHERE sync_state='sync';")
if [ "$SYNC_COUNT" -lt 2 ]; then
echo "ERROR: Need at least 2 synchronous replicas"
exit 1
fi
# Confirm recent backup exists
LAST_BACKUP=$(kubectl get job postgres-backup -o jsonpath='{.status.completionTime}')
echo "Last backup: $LAST_BACKUP"
# Test failover capability in staging first
echo "✅ Prerequisites validated"
```


#### Step 1: Scale up with a new node

```
# Add new node with upgraded Kubernetes version
kubectl patch statefulset postgres-cluster --patch '{
"spec": {
"replicas": 4,
"template": {
"spec": {
"nodeSelector": {
"kubernetes.io/arch": "amd64",
"aks-nodepool": "upgraded-pool"
}
}
}
}
}'
# Monitor new pod startup
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres-cluster -w
# Verify new replica joins cluster
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```


#### Step 2: Run a controlled failover

```
#!/bin/bash
# controlled-failover.sh
echo "=== Starting Controlled Failover ==="
# Ensure minimal replication lag (< 0.1-second)
LAG=$(kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -t -c "SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp());")
if (( $(echo "$LAG > 0.1" | bc -l) )); then
echo "ERROR: Replication lag too high ($LAG seconds)"
exit 1
fi
# Pause application writes (use connection pool drain)
kubectl patch configmap pgbouncer-config --patch '{"data":{"pgbouncer.ini":"[databases]\napp_db = host=postgres-primary port=5432 dbname=appdb pool_mode=statement max_db_connections=0"}}'
# Wait for active transactions to complete
sleep 10
# Promote new primary (this is the 30-second downtime window)
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# Update service selector to new primary
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{
"spec": {
"selector": {
"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "postgres-cluster-3"
}
}
}'
# Resume application writes
kubectl patch configmap pgbouncer-config --patch '{"data":{"pgbouncer.ini":"[databases]\napp_db = host=postgres-primary port=5432 dbname=appdb pool_mode=statement"}}'
echo "✅ Failover completed"
```


#### Step 3: Clean up and validate

```
# Remove old primary node
kubectl delete pod postgres-cluster-0 --force
# Scale back to 3 replicas
kubectl patch statefulset postgres-cluster --patch '{"spec":{"replicas":3}}'
# Validate cluster health
kubectl exec postgres-cluster-3 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Test application connectivity
kubectl run test-db-connection --image=postgres:15 --rm -it -- psql -h postgres-primary -U app_user -d app_db -c "SELECT version();"
```


### Advanced configuration

For mission-critical databases that require a <10-second downtime:

```
# Use synchronous replication with multiple standbys
# postgresql.conf
synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 2 (standby1, standby2, standby3)'
synchronous_commit = 'remote_apply'
```


### Success validation

To validate your progress, use the following checklist:

- New primary accepts reads and writes.
- All replicas show healthy replication.
- Application reconnects automatically.
- No data loss detected.
- Backup/restore tested on new primary.

### Emergency rollback

##### For immediate issues (<2 minutes)

Redirect traffic to the previous primary:

```
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{
"spec": {
"selector": {
"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name": "postgres-cluster-1"
}
}
}'
```


##### For comprehensive failover recovery (5-10 minutes)

Stop writes to the current primary:

`kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- psql -c "SELECT pg_reload_conf();"`

Redirect service to a healthy replica:

`kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name":"postgres-replica-1-0"}}}'`

Promote a replica to the new primary:

`kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-1-0 --timeout=60s`

Update connection strings:

`kubectl patch configmap postgres-config --patch '{"data":{"primary-host":"postgres-replica-1-0.postgres"}}'`

Verify that the new primary accepts writes:

`kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "CREATE TABLE upgrade_test (id serial, timestamp timestamp default now());" kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "INSERT INTO upgrade_test DEFAULT VALUES;"`


**Expected outcome:** Approximately 30-second downtime, zero data loss, and an upgraded node that runs the current version of Kubernetes.

#### Step 3: Upgrade Node1 (former primary)

```
#!/bin/bash
# upgrade-node1.sh
echo "=== Step 3: Upgrade Node1 (Former Primary) ==="
# Drain Node1 gracefully
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
# Trigger node upgrade
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Monitor upgrade progress
while kubectl get node aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}' | grep -q "False"; do
echo "Waiting for node upgrade to complete..."
sleep 30
done
echo "Node1 upgrade completed"
```


#### Step 4: Rejoin Node1 as a replica

```
#!/bin/bash
# rejoin-node1.sh
echo "=== Step 4: Rejoin Node1 as Replica ==="
# Wait for postgres pod to be scheduled on upgraded node
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-primary-0 --timeout=300s
# Reconfigure as replica pointing to new primary (Node2)
kubectl exec postgres-primary-0 -- bash -c "
echo 'standby_mode = on' >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf
echo 'primary_conninfo = \"host=postgres-replica-1-0.postgres port=5432\"' >> /var/lib/postgresql/data/recovery.conf
"
# Restart postgres to apply replica configuration
kubectl delete pod postgres-primary-0
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-primary-0 --timeout=120s
# Verify replication is working
kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication WHERE application_name='postgres-primary-0';"
echo "Node1 successfully rejoined as replica"
```


#### Step 5: Upgrade Node3 (Replica-2)

```
#!/bin/bash
# upgrade-node3.sh
echo "=== Step 5: Upgrade Node3 (Replica-2) ==="
# Similar process for Node3
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Wait for upgrade and pod readiness
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-2-0 --timeout=300s
# Verify all replicas are in sync
kubectl exec postgres-replica-1-0 -- psql -c "SELECT application_name, state, sync_state FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```


#### Step 6: Final failover (Node2 → Node3)

```
#!/bin/bash
# final-failover.sh
echo "=== Step 6: Final Failover and Node2 Upgrade ==="
# Failover primary from Node2 to Node3
kubectl patch service postgres-primary --patch '{"spec":{"selector":{"statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name":"postgres-replica-2-0"}}}'
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
# Upgrade Node2
kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 --grace-period=300 --delete-emptydir-data --ignore-daemonsets
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--resource-group production-rg \
--cluster-name aks-prod \
--name nodepool1 \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.0 \
--max-surge 0 \
--max-unavailable 1
# Rejoin Node2 as replica
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod postgres-replica-1-0 --timeout=300s
echo "All nodes upgraded successfully. PostgreSQL cluster operational."
```


### Validation and monitoring

```
#!/bin/bash
# post-upgrade-validation.sh
echo "=== Post-Upgrade Validation ==="
# Verify cluster topology
kubectl get pods -l app=postgres -o wide
# Check all replicas are connected
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "SELECT application_name, client_addr, state FROM pg_stat_replication;"
# Validate data integrity
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM upgrade_test;"
# Performance validation
kubectl exec postgres-replica-2-0 -- psql -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"
echo "Upgrade validation completed successfully"
```


## Redis cluster rolling replace

In this scenario, a six-node Redis cluster (three primaries and three replicas) requires zero downtime.

### Implementation

```
#!/bin/bash
# redis-cluster-upgrade.sh
echo "=== Redis Cluster Rolling Upgrade ==="
# Get cluster topology
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster nodes
# Upgrade replica nodes first (no impact to writes)
for replica in redis-1 redis-3 redis-5; do
echo "Upgrading replica: $replica"
# Remove replica from cluster temporarily
REPLICA_ID=$(kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster nodes | grep $replica | cut -d' ' -f1)
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster forget $REPLICA_ID
# Drain and upgrade node
kubectl delete pod $replica
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod $replica --timeout=120s
# Rejoin cluster
kubectl exec redis-0 -- redis-cli cluster meet $(kubectl get pod $replica -o jsonpath='{.status.podIP}') 6379
echo "Replica $replica upgraded and rejoined"
done
# Upgrade master nodes with failover
for master in redis-0 redis-2 redis-4; do
echo "Upgrading master: $master"
# Trigger failover to replica
kubectl exec $master -- redis-cli cluster failover
# Wait for failover completion
sleep 10
# Upgrade the demoted master (now replica)
kubectl delete pod $master
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod $master --timeout=120s
echo "Master $master upgraded"
done
echo "Redis cluster upgrade completed"
```


## MongoDB replica set step-down

In this scenario, a three-member MongoDB replica set requires coordinated primary step-down.

### Implementation

```
#!/bin/bash
# MongoDB upgrade script
Echo "=== MongoDB Replica Set Upgrade ==="
# Check replica set status
kubectl exec mongo-0 --mongo --eval "rs.status()"
```
