Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to create one or more node pools in an AKS cluster.

Note

This feature enables more control over creating and managing multiple node pools and requires separate commands for *create/update/delete* (CRUD) operations. Previously, cluster operations through [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) or

[used the managedCluster API and were the only options to change your control plane and a single node pool. This feature exposes a separate operation set for agent pools through the agentPool API and requires use of the](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update)

`az aks update`

[command set to execute operations on an individual node pool.](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool)

`az aks nodepool`

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- You need Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To deploy an ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the

`Microsoft.Resources/deployments`

resource type. For example, to deploy a virtual machine (VM), you need`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write`

and`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`

permissions. For a list of roles and permissions, see[Azure built-in roles](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).Review the following requirements for each parameter:

`osTYPE`

: The operating system type. The default is Linux.`osSKU`

: Specifies the OS SKU used by the agent pool.`count`

: Number of agents (VMs) to host docker containers. Allowed values must be in the range of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) for user pools and in the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive) for system pools. The default value is 1.

After you deploy the cluster using an ARM template, you can use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to connect to the cluster and deploy the sample application.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create AKS clusters that support multiple node pools:

You can delete the system node pool if you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster. Otherwise, you can't delete the system node pool.

System pools must contain at least one node. User node pools can contain zero or more nodes.

**If you create a cluster with a single node pool, the OS type must be**. The OS SKU can be any Linux variation such as`Linux`

`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

. You can't create a cluster with a single Windows node pool. If you want to run Windows containers, you must[add a Windows node pool](#add-a-windows-server-node-pool)to the cluster after creating it with a Linux system node pool.The AKS cluster must use the Standard SKU load balancer to use multiple node pools. This feature isn't supported with Basic SKU load balancers.

The AKS cluster must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets for the nodes.

The name of a node pool can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter.

- For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1-12 characters.
- For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1-6 characters.

All node pools must reside in the same virtual network.

You can't change the virtual machine (VM) size of a node pool after you create it.

When you create multiple node pools at cluster creation time, the Kubernetes versions for the node pools must match the version set for the control plane. You can make updates after provisioning the cluster using per node pool operations.


## Create specialized node pools

To learn how to create specialized node pools, see the following articles:

[Add an Azure Spot node pool to an AKS cluster](spot-node-pool)[Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an AKS cluster](virtual-machines-node-pools)[Add a dedicated system node pool to an AKS cluster](use-system-pools#add-a-dedicated-system-node-pool-to-an-existing-aks-cluster)[Enabled Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) on an AKS node pool](enable-fips-nodes)[Add a node pool with a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) on an AKS cluster](use-cvm)[Create node pools with unique subnets in AKS](node-pool-unique-subnet)[Add a generation 2 VM node pool to an AKS cluster](generation-2-vms)[Add a node pool with Artifact Streaming to an AKS cluster](artifact-streaming)[Add Windows Server node pools with](windows-containerd)`containerd`

to an AKS cluster

## Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables in your shell to simplify the commands in this article. You can change the values to your preferred names.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="my-aks-rg" export LOCATION="eastus" export CLUSTER_NAME="my-aks-cluster" export NODE_POOL_NAME="mynodepool"`


## Create a resource group

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using the Azure CLI

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

[Create an AKS cluster with a single Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_1_ubuntu) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_1_azure-linux) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_os-guard) -
[Create an AKS cluster with a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_1_flatcar)

Create a cluster with a single Ubuntu node pool using the

command. This step specifies two nodes in the single node pool.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --node-count 2 \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --location $LOCATION \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster.

When the cluster is ready, get the cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add a second node pool using the Azure CLI

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

Note

If you want to add a node pool that uses **Ephemeral OS disks** to your AKS cluster, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Ephemeral`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

With Ephemeral OS, you can deploy VMs and instance images up to the size of the VM cache. The default node OS disk configuration in AKS uses 128 GB, which means that you need a VM size that has a cache larger than 128 GB. The default `Standard_DS2_v2`

has a cache size of 86 GB, which isn't large enough. The `Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU has a cache size of 172 GB, which is large enough. You can also reduce the default size of the OS disk using `--node-osdisk-size`

, but keep in mind the minimum size for AKS images is 30 GB.

If you want to create node pools with **network-attached OS disks**, you can set the `--node-osdisk-type`

flag to `Managed`

when running the `az aks nodepool add`

command.

### Add a Linux node pool

-
[Add an Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_2_ubuntu) -
[Add an Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_2_azure-linux) -
[Add an Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_os-guard) -
[Add a Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_2_flatcar)

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Linux`

node pool with the`Ubuntu`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes. If you don't specify an OS SKU, AKS defaults to`Ubuntu`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Linux \ --os-sku Ubuntu \ --node-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to create the node pool.


### Add a Windows Server node pool

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Register the `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the

command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show`az feature show`

*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


##### Create the Windows Server 2025 node pool

Create a new node pool using the

command. The following example creates a`az aks nodepool add`

`Windows`

node pool with the`Windows2025`

OS SKU that runs*three*nodes.For more information about Windows OS, see

[Windows best practices](windows-best-practices).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 \ --os-type Windows \ --os-sku Windows2025 \ --node-count 3`


## Check the status of your node pools

Check the status of your node pools using the

command and specify your resource group and cluster name.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool using an ARM template

If you want only one node pool in your AKS cluster, you can schedule application pods on system node pools. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster in a production environment, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. If one node goes down, the redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by having more system node pool nodes.

### Create a `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

resource

- Create a
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`

resource by adding[this JSON](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters?pivots=deployment-language-arm-template)to your template.

[Modify JSON to create a single Ubuntu node pool](#tabpanel_4_ubuntu-arm) -
[Modify JSON to create a single Azure Linux node pool](#tabpanel_4_azure-linux-arm) -
[Modify JSON to create a single Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_4_os-guard-arm) -
[Modify JSON to create a single Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview) node pool](#tabpanel_4_flatcar-arm)

Create a single Ubuntu node pool in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "1", "osSKU": "ubuntu", "osType": "linux" } ], }`


## Add a second node pool using an ARM template

The cluster created in the [previous section](#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-an-arm-template) has a single node pool. In this section, we add a second node pool to the cluster. This second node pool can have an OS type of `Linux`

with an OS SKU of `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

, or an OS type of `Windows`

.

##### Install the `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty.

Create multiple Windows node pools in your AKS cluster by making the following modifications to your ARM template:

`"properties": { "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "count": "3", "osSKU": "windows2025", "osType": "windows" } ], }`


## Deploy your ARM template

- Deploy your ARM template by following the guidance in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using an ARM template](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-rm-template).

## Set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool

When creating a node pool, you can add taints, labels, or tags to it. When you add a taint, label, or tag, all nodes within that node pool also get that taint, label, or tag. We recommend applying these properties to an entire node pool instead of individual nodes. This way, you can easily manage the properties of all nodes in the node pool by updating the node pool properties instead of updating each node individually.

For specific instructions on how to set taints, labels, or tags for a node pool, use the following resources:

[Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-node-taints)[Use labels in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-labels)[Use Azure tags in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-tags)[Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations)

### Perform manual upgrades

Manual upgrades let you control when your cluster upgrades to a new Kubernetes version. These upgrades are useful for testing or targeting a specific version:

[Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster)[Upgrade multiple AKS clusters via Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/update-orchestration)[Upgrade the node image](node-image-upgrade)[Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade)[Process node OS updates](node-updates-kured)

### Configure automatic upgrades

Automatic upgrades keep your cluster on a supported version and up to date. Use these upgrades when you want to automate your settings:

[Automatically upgrade an AKS cluster](auto-upgrade-cluster)[Automatically upgrade multiple AKS clusters via Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/update-automation)[Use planned maintenance to schedule and control upgrades](planned-maintenance)[Stop AKS cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes (preview)](stop-cluster-upgrade-api-breaking-changes)[Automatically upgrade AKS cluster node operating system images](auto-upgrade-node-image)[Apply security updates to AKS nodes automatically by using GitHub actions](node-upgrade-github-actions)

### Special considerations for node pools that span multiple availability zones

AKS uses best-effort zone balancing in node groups. During an upgrade surge, the zones for surge nodes in virtual machine scale sets are unknown ahead of time, which can temporarily cause an unbalanced zone configuration. AKS deletes surge nodes after the upgrade and restores the original zone balance.

To keep zones balanced, set surge to a multiple of three nodes. Persistent volume claims that use Azure locally redundant storage disks are zone bound and might cause downtime if surge nodes are in a different zone. Use a [pod disruption budget (PDB)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) to maintain high availability during drains.

### Optimize upgrades to improve performance and minimize disruptions

Combine [planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance), [max surge](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade), [PDB](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/), [node drain timeout](upgrade-aks-cluster#set-node-drain-timeout-value), and [node soak time](upgrade-aks-cluster#set-node-soak-time-value) to increase the likelihood of successful, low-disruption upgrades:

[Planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance): Schedule auto-upgrade during low-traffic periods. We recommend at least four hours.[Max surge](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling#set-max-surge-value): Higher values speed upgrades but might disrupt workloads. We recommend 33% for production.[Max unavailable](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling#customize-unavailable-nodes): Use when capacity is limited.[Pod disruption budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/): Set to limit pods down during upgrades. Validate for your service.[Node drain timeout](upgrade-aks-cluster#set-node-drain-timeout-value): Configure pod eviction wait duration. The default is 30 minutes.[Node soak time](upgrade-aks-cluster#set-node-soak-time-value): Stagger upgrades to minimize downtime. The default is 0 minutes.

| Upgrade settings | How extra nodes are used | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
`maxSurge=5` , `maxUnavailable=0` |
5 surge nodes | Five nodes are surged for upgrade. |
`maxSurge=5` , `maxUnavailable=0` |
0-4 surge nodes | Upgrade fails because of insufficient surge nodes. |
`maxSurge=0` , `maxUnavailable=5` |
N/A | Five existing nodes are drained for upgrade. |

Note

Before you upgrade, check for API breaking changes and review the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) to avoid disruptions.

## Validations used in the upgrade process

AKS performs pre-upgrade validations to ensure cluster health:

**API breaking changes:**Detects deprecated APIs.**Kubernetes upgrade version:**Ensures a valid upgrade path.**PDB configuration:**Checks for misconfigured PDBs (for example,`maxUnavailable=0`

).**Quota:**Confirms enough quota for surge nodes.**Subnet:**Verifies sufficient IP addresses.**Certificates/service principals:**Detects expired credentials.

These checks help to minimize upgrade failures and provide early visibility into issues.

## Common upgrade scenarios and recommendations

### Scenario 1: Capacity constraints

If your cluster is limited by product tier or regional capacity, upgrades might fail when surge nodes can't be provisioned. This situation is common with specialized product tiers (like GPU nodes) or in regions with limited resources. Errors such as `SKUNotAvailable`

, `AllocationFailed`

, or `OverconstrainedAllocationRequest`

might occur if `maxSurge`

is set too high for available capacity.

#### Recommendations to prevent or resolve

- Use
`maxUnavailable`

to upgrade by using existing nodes instead of surging new ones. For more information, see[Customize unavailable nodes during upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-unavailable-nodes-during-upgrade). - Lower
`maxSurge`

to reduce extra capacity needs. For more information, see[Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade). - For security-only updates, use security patch reimages that don't require surge nodes. For more information, see
[Apply security and kernel updates to Linux nodes in Azure Kubernetes Service](node-updates-kured).

### Scenario 2: Node drain failures and PDBs

Upgrades require draining nodes (evicting pods). Drains can fail when pods are slow to terminate or strict [Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) block pod evictions.

Example error:

```
Code: UpgradeFailed
Message: Drain node ... failed when evicting pod ... Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
```


#### Option 1: Force upgrade (bypass PDB)

Warning

Force upgrade bypasses Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) constraints and may cause service disruption by draining all pods simultaneously. Before using this option, first try to fix PDB misconfigurations (review the PDB minAvailable/maxUnavailable settings, ensure adequate pod replicas, verify PDBs aren't blocking all evictions).

Use force upgrade only when PDBs prevent critical upgrades and cannot be resolved. This will override PDB protections and potentially cause complete service unavailability during the upgrade.

**Requirements:** Azure CLI 2.79.0+ or AKS API version 2025-09-01+

```
az aks upgrade \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--kubernetes-version $KUBERNETES_VERSION \
--enable-force-upgrade \
--upgrade-override-until 2023-10-01T13:00:00Z
```


Note

- The
`upgrade-override-until`

parameter defines when validation bypass ends (must be a future date/time) - If not specified, the window defaults to 3 days from current time
- The 'Z' indicates UTC/GMT time zone

Warning

When force upgrade is enabled, it takes precedence over all other drain configurations. The undrainable node behavior settings (Option 2) will not be applied when force upgrade is active.

#### Option 2: Handle undrainable nodes (honor PDB)

Use this conservative approach to honor PDBs while preventing upgrade failures.

**Configure undrainable node behavior:**

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--cluster-name <cluster-name> \
--name <node-pool-name> \
--undrainable-node-behavior Cordon \
--max-blocked-nodes 2 \
--drain-timeout 30
```


**Behavior options:**

**Schedule (default):**Deletes blocked node and surges replacement**Cordon (recommended):**Cordons node and labels it as`kubernetes.azure.com/upgrade-status=Quarantined`


**Max blocked nodes (preview):**

- Specifies how many nodes that fail to drain are tolerated
- Requires
`undrainable-node-behavior`

to be set - Defaults to
`maxSurge`

value (typically 10%) if not specified

##### Prerequisites for max blocked nodes

The Azure CLI

`aks-preview`

extension version 18.0.0b9 or later is required to use the max blocked nodes feature.`# Install or update the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview az extension update --name aks-preview`


##### Example configuration with max blocked nodes

```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name jizenMC1 \
--name nodepool1 \
--resource-group jizenTestMaxBlockedNodesRG \
--max-surge 1 \
--undrainable-node-behavior Cordon \
--max-blocked-nodes 2 \
--drain-timeout 5
```


#### Recommendations to prevent drain failures

- Set
`maxUnavailable`

in PDBs to allow at least one pod eviction - Increase pod replicas to meet disruption budget requirements
- Extend drain timeout if workloads need more time. (The default is
*30 minutes*.) - Test PDBs in staging, monitor upgrade events, and use blue-green deployments for critical workloads. For more information, see
[Blue-green deployment of AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/aks/blue-green-deployment-for-aks).

##### Verify undrainable nodes

The blocked nodes are unscheduled for pods and marked with the label

`"kubernetes.azure.com/upgrade-status: Quarantined"`

.Verify the label on any blocked nodes when there's a drain node failure on upgrade:

`kubectl get nodes --show-labels=true`


##### Resolve undrainable nodes

Remove the responsible PDB:

`kubectl delete pdb <pdb-name>`

Remove the

`kubernetes.azure.com/upgrade-status: Quarantined`

label:`kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-name>`

Optionally, delete the blocked node:

`az aks nodepool delete-machines --cluster-name <cluster-name> --machine-names <machine-name> --name <node-pool-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`

After you finish this step, you can reconcile the cluster status by performing any update operation without the optional fields as outlined in

[az aks](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update). Alternatively, you can scale the node pool to the same number of nodes as the count of upgraded nodes. This action ensures that the node pool gets to its intended original size. AKS prioritizes the removal of the blocked nodes. This command also restores the cluster provisioning status to`Succeeded`

. In the following example,`2`

is the total number of upgraded nodes.`# Update the cluster to restore the provisioning status az aks update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> # Scale the node pool to restore the original size az aks nodepool scale --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --name <node-pool-name> --node-count 2`


### Scenario 3: Slow upgrades

Conservative settings or node-level issues can delay upgrades, which affects your ability to stay current with patches and improvements.

Common causes of slow upgrades include:

- Low
`maxSurge`

or`maxUnavailable`

values (limits parallelism). - High soak times (long waits between node upgrades).
- Drain failures (see
[Node drain failures](#scenario-2-node-drain-failures-and-pdbs)).

#### Recommendations to prevent or resolve

- Use
`maxSurge=33%`

,`maxUnavailable=1`

for production. - Use
`maxSurge=50%`

,`maxUnavailable=2`

for dev/test. - Use OS Security Patch for fast, targeted patching (avoids full node reimaging).
- Enable
`undrainableNodeBehavior`

to avoid upgrade blockers.

### Scenario 4: IP exhaustion

Surge nodes require more IPs. If the subnet is near capacity, node provisioning can fail (for example, `Error: SubnetIsFull`

). This scenario is common with Azure Container Networking Interface, high `maxPods`

, or large node counts.

#### Recommendations to prevent or resolve

Ensure that your subnet has enough IPs for all nodes, surge nodes, and pods. The formula is

`Total IPs = (Number of nodes + maxSurge) * (1 + maxPods)`

.Reclaim unused IPs or expand the subnet (for example, from /24 to /22).

Lower

`maxSurge`

if subnet expansion isn't possible:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --max-surge 10%`

Monitor IP usage with Azure Monitor or custom alerts.

Reduce

`maxPods`

per node, clean up orphaned load balancer IPs, and plan subnet sizing for high-scale clusters.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I use open-source tools for validation?

Yes. Many open-source tools integrate well with AKS upgrade processes:

[kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble): Scans for deprecated APIs before upgrades.[Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/): Security scanning for container images and Kubernetes configurations.[Sonobuoy](https://sonobuoy.io/): Kubernetes conformance testing and cluster validation.[kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench): Security benchmark checks against Center for Internet Security standards.[Polaris](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris): Validation of Kubernetes best practices.[kubectl-neat](https://github.com/itaysk/kubectl-neat): Clean up Kubernetes manifests for validation.

### How do I validate API compatibility before upgrading?

Run deprecation checks by using tools like kubent:

```
# Install and run API deprecation scanner
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble/releases/latest/download/knt-full.yaml
# Check for deprecated APIs in your cluster
kubectl run knt --image=doitintl/knt:latest --rm -it --restart=Never -- \
-c /kubeconfig -o json > api-deprecation-report.json
# Review findings
cat api-deprecation-report.json | jq '.[] | select(.deprecated==true)'
```


### What makes AKS upgrades different from other Kubernetes platforms?

AKS provides several unique advantages:

- Native Azure integration with Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Load Balancer, and networking.
- Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager for coordinated multicluster upgrades.
- Automatic node image patching without manual node management.
- Built-in validation for quota, networking, and credentials.
- Azure support for upgrade-related issues.
