Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Kubernetes. By adopting and using CSI, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can write, deploy, and iterate plug-ins to expose new or improve existing storage systems in Kubernetes without having to touch the core Kubernetes code and wait for its release cycles.

The CSI storage driver support on AKS allows you to natively use:

can be used to create a Kubernetes**Azure Disks***DataDisk*resource. Disks can use Azure Premium Storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard Storage, backed by regular HDDs or Standard SSDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium Storage. Azure Disks are mounted as*ReadWriteOnce*and are only available to one node in AKS. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple nodes simultaneously, use Azure Files.can be used to mount an SMB 3.0/3.1 share backed by an Azure storage account to pods. With Azure Files, you can share data across multiple nodes and pods. Azure Files can use Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs or Azure Premium storage backed by high-performance SSDs.**Azure Files**can be used to mount Blob storage (or object storage) as a file system into a container or pod. Using Blob storage enables your cluster to support applications that work with large unstructured datasets like log file data, images or documents, HPC, and others. Additionally, if you ingest data into**Azure Blob storage**[Azure Data Lake storage](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), you can directly mount and use it in AKS without configuring another interim filesystem.

Tip

If you want a fully managed solution for block-level access to data, consider using [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction) instead of CSI drivers. Azure Container Storage integrates with Kubernetes, allowing dynamic and automatic provisioning of persistent volumes. Azure Container Storage supports Azure Disks, Ephemeral Disks, and Azure Elastic SAN (preview) as backing storage, offering flexibility and scalability for stateful applications running on Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.42 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If the open-source CSI storage driver is installed on your cluster, uninstall it before enabling the Azure storage CSI driver.
- To enforce the Azure Policy for AKS
[policy definition](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#kubernetes)**Kubernetes clusters should use Container Storage Interface(CSI) driver StorageClass**, the Azure Policy add-on needs to be enabled on new and existing clusters. For an existing cluster, review the[Learn Azure Policy for Kubernetes](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes)to enable it.

## Disk encryption supported scenarios

CSI storage drivers support the following scenarios:

[Encrypted managed disks with customer-managed keys](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-cross-tenant-customer-managed-keys)using Azure Key Vaults stored in a different Microsoft Entra tenant.- Encrypt your Azure Storage disks hosting AKS OS and application data with
[customer-managed keys](azure-disk-customer-managed-keys).

## Enable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster

To enable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--enable-disk-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--enable-file-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--enable-blob-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--enable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to enable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --enable-disk-driver --enable-file-driver --enable-blob-driver --enable-snapshot-controller
```


It might take several minutes to complete this action. Once it's complete, you should see in the output the status of enabling the driver on your cluster. The following example resembles the section indicating the results when enabling the Blob storage CSI driver:

```
"storageProfile": {
"blobCsiDriver": {
"enabled": true
},
```


## Disable CSI storage drivers on a new or existing cluster

To disable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--disable-disk-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--disable-file-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--disable-blob-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--disable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to disable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks create \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


To disable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster, use one of the parameters listed earlier depending on the storage system:

```
az aks update \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller
```


Note

We recommend deleting the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim object instead of the PersistentVolume object when deleting a CSI volume. The external provisioner in the CSI driver will react to the deletion of the PersistentVolumeClaim and based on its reclamation policy, it issues the DeleteVolume call against the CSI volume driver commands to delete the volume. The PersistentVolume object is then deleted.

## Migrate custom in-tree storage classes to CSI

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.26, in-tree persistent volume types *kubernetes.io/azure-disk* and *kubernetes.io/azure-file* are deprecated and will no longer be supported. *In-tree drivers* refers to the storage drivers that are part of the core Kubernetes code opposed to the CSI drivers, which are plug-ins.

Removing these drivers following their deprecation isn't planned, however you should migrate to the corresponding CSI drivers *disk.csi.azure.com* and *file.csi.azure.com*. To review the migration options for your storage classes and upgrade your cluster to use Azure Disks and Azure Files CSI drivers, see [Migrate from in-tree to CSI drivers](csi-migrate-in-tree-volumes).

If you've created in-tree driver storage classes, those storage classes continue to work since CSI migration is turned on after upgrading your cluster to 1.21.x. If you want to use CSI features you'll need to perform the migration.

## Next steps

- To use the CSI driver for Azure Disks, see
[Use Azure Disks with CSI drivers](azure-disk-csi). - To use the CSI driver for Azure Files, see
[Use Azure Files with CSI drivers](azure-files-csi). - To use the CSI driver for Azure Blob storage, see
[Use Azure Blob storage with CSI drivers](azure-blob-csi) - For more about storage best practices, see

# Resize node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You might want to change the size of your virtual machines (VMs) to accommodate an increasing number of deployments or to run a larger workload. Resizing AKS instances directly isn't supported when using [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) in AKS, as outlined in the [support policies for AKS](support-policies#user-customization-of-agent-nodes):

AKS agent nodes appear in the Azure portal as regular Azure IaaS resources. But these virtual machines are deployed into a custom Azure resource group (usually prefixed with MC_*). You can't make direct customizations to these nodes using the IaaS APIs or resources. Any custom changes that aren't done via the AKS API won't persist through an upgrade, scale, update, or reboot.


In this article, you learn the recommended method to resize a node pool by creating a new node pool with the desired SKU size, cordoning and draining the existing nodes, and then removing the existing node pool.

Important

This method is specific to [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview)-based AKS clusters. When using Virtual Machines-based node pools, you can easily update the VM sizes in an existing node pool using a single Azure CLI command and have multiple VM sizes in the same node pool. For more information, see the [Virtual Machines node pools documentation](virtual-machines-node-pools).

## Create a new node pool with the desired SKU

Note

Every AKS cluster must contain at least one system node pool with at least one node. In this example, we use a `--mode`

of `System`

to add a system node pool to replace the system node pool we want to resize. You can [update the mode of a node pool](use-system-pools#update-existing-cluster-system-and-user-node-pools) at any time. You can also add a user node pool by setting `--mode`

to `User`

.

When resizing, make sure you consider all workload requirements, such as availability zones, and configure your VMSS node pool accordingly. You might need to modify the following command to best fit your needs. For a full list of the configuration options, see the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) reference page.

Create a new node pool using the

command. In this example, we create a new node pool,`az aks nodepool add`

`mynodepool`

, with three nodes and the`Standard_DS3_v2`

VM SKU to replace an existing node pool,`nodepool1`

, that has the`Standard_DS2_v2`

VM SKU.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name mynodepool \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_DS3_v2 \ --mode System \ --no-wait`

It takes a few minutes for the new node pool to be created.

Get the status of the new node pool using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing both the new node pool

`mynodepool`

and the existing node pool`nodepool1`

:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000000 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000001 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000002 Ready agent 23m v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 10d v1.21.9`


## Cordon the existing nodes

Cordoning marks specified nodes as unschedulable and prevents any more pods from being added to the nodes.

Get the names of the nodes you want to cordon using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing the nodes in the existing node pool

`nodepool1`

that you want to cordon:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 7d21h v1.21.9`

Cordon the existing nodes using the

`kubectl cordon`

command, specifying the desired nodes in a space-separated list. For example:`kubectl cordon aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing that the nodes are cordoned:

`node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 cordoned node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 cordoned node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 cordoned`


## Drain the existing nodes

Important

To successfully drain nodes and evict running pods, ensure that any PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) allow for at least one pod replica to be moved at a time. Otherwise, the drain/evict operation fails. To check this, you can run `kubectl get pdb -A`

and verify `ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS`

is at least `1`

or higher.

When you drain nodes, the pods running on them are evicted and recreated on the other schedulable nodes.

Drain the existing nodes using the

`kubectl drain`

command with the`--ignore-daemonsets`

and`--delete-emptydir-data`

flags, specifying the desired nodes in a space-separated list. For example:Important

Using

`--delete-emptydir-data`

is required to evict the AKS-created`coredns`

and`metrics-server`

pods. If you don't use this flag, you get an error. For more information, see the[documentation on emptydir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).`kubectl drain aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000001 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000002 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`

After the drain operation finishes, all pods (excluding the pods controlled by daemon sets) should be running on the new node pool. You can verify this using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide -A`


### Troubleshoot pod eviction issues

You might encounter the following error when draining nodes:


`Error when evicting pods/[podname] -n [namespace] (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.`


By default, your cluster has AKS-managed pod disruption budgets (such as `coredns-pdb`

or `konnectivity-agent`

) with a `MinAvailable`

of `1`

. For example, if there are two `coredns`

pods running, only one can be disrupted at a time. While one of them is getting recreated and is unavailable, the other `coredns`

pod can't be evicted due to the pod disruption budget. This issue resolves itself after the initial `coredns`

pod is scheduled and running, allowing the second pod to be properly evicted and recreated.

Tip

Consider draining nodes one by one for a smoother eviction experience and to avoid throttling. For more information, see:

## Remove the existing node pool

Important

When you delete a node pool, AKS doesn't perform cordon and drain. To minimize the disruption of rescheduling pods currently running on the node pool you plan to delete, perform a cordon and drain on all nodes in the node pool before deleting.

Delete the original node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool delete`

`az aks nodepool delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1`

Verify that your AKS cluster has only the new node pool with the applications and pods properly running using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should resemble the following example output, showing only the new node pool

`mynodepool`

:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000000 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000001 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-98765432-vmss000002 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9`
