Efficient placement and optimization of GPU workloads often requires visibility into resource utilization and performance. Managed GPU metrics on AKS (preview) provide automated collection and exposure of GPU utilization, memory, and performance data across NVIDIA GPU-enabled node pools. This enables platform administrators to optimize cluster resources and developers to tune and debug workloads with limited manual instrumentation.

In this article, you learn about GPU metrics collected by the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager [(DCGM) exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/tree/main) with [a fully managed GPU-enabled node pool (preview)](aks-managed-gpu-nodes) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with
[a fully managed GPU-enabled node pool (preview)](aks-managed-gpu-nodes)and ensure that the[GPUs are schedulable](use-nvidia-gpu#confirm-that-gpus-are-schedulable). - A
[sample GPU workload](use-nvidia-gpu#run-a-gpu-enabled-workload)deployed to your node pool.

## Limitations

- Managed GPU metrics is not currently supported with
[Azure Managed Prometheus or Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable).

## Verify that managed GPU components are installed

After creating your managed NVIDIA GPU node pool (preview) following [these instructions](aks-managed-gpu-nodes), confirm that the GPU software components were installed with the [az aks nodepool show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command:

```
az aks nodepool show \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--cluster-name <cluster-name> \
--name <node-pool-name> \
```


Your output should include the following values:

```
...
...
"gpuInstanceProfile": …
"gpuProfile": {
"driver": "Install"
},
...
...
```


## Understanding GPU metrics

### GPU Utilization Metrics

GPU Utilization metrics show the percentage of time the GPU’s cores are actively processing work. High values indicate that the GPU is heavily used, which is generally desirable for workloads like training or data processing. Interpretation of this metric should consider the type of workload: AI training typically keeps utilization high, while inference may have intermittent utilization due to bursty traffic.

Memory Utilization: Shows the percentage of GPU memory in use. High memory usage without high GPU utilization can indicate memory-bound workloads where the GPU waits on memory transfers. Low memory usage with low utilization may suggest the workload is too small to fully leverage the GPU.

SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) Efficiency: Measures the efficiency with which the GPU’s cores are used. A low SM efficiency indicates that cores are idle or underutilized due to workload imbalance or suboptimal kernel design. High efficiency is ideal for compute-heavy applications.

### Memory Metrics

Memory Bandwidth Utilization: Reflects how much of the theoretical memory bandwidth is being consumed. High bandwidth utilization with low compute utilization can indicate a memory-bound workload. Conversely, high utilization in both compute and memory bandwidth suggests a well-balanced workload.

Memory Errors: Tracks ECC (Error-Correcting Code) errors if enabled. A high number of errors may indicate hardware degradation or thermal issues and should be monitored for reliability.

### Temperature and Power Metrics

GPU Temperature: Indicates the operating temperature of the GPU. Sustained high temperatures can trigger thermal throttling, reducing performance. Ideal interpretation of this metric involves observing temperature relative to the GPU’s thermal limits and cooling capacity.

Power Usage: Shows instantaneous power draw. Comparing power usage to TDP (Thermal Design Power) helps understand whether the GPU is being pushed to its limits. Sudden drops in power may indicate throttling or underutilization.

### Clocks and Frequency Metrics

GPU Clock: The actual operating frequency of the GPU. Combined with utilization, this helps determine if the GPU is throttling or underperforming relative to its potential.

Memory Clock: Operating frequency of GPU memory. Memory-bound workloads may benefit from higher memory clocks; a mismatch between memory and compute utilization can highlight bottlenecks.

### PCIe and NVLink Metrics

PCIe Bandwidth: Measures the throughput over the PCIe bus. Low utilization with heavy workloads may suggest CPU-GPU communication is not a bottleneck. High utilization could point to data transfer limitations impacting performance.

NVLink Bandwidth: This metric is similar to PCIe bandwidth but specific to NVLink interconnects, and relevant in multi-GPU systems for cross-GPU communication. High NVLink usage with low SM utilization may indicate synchronization or data transfer delays.

### Error and Reliability Metrics

Retired Pages and XID Errors: Track GPU memory errors and critical failures. Frequent occurrences signal potential hardware faults and require attention for long-running workloads.

### Interpretation Guidance

DCGM metrics should always be interpreted contextually with the type of your workload on AKS. A high compute-intensive workload should ideally show high GPU and SM utilization, high memory bandwidth usage, stable temperatures below throttling thresholds, and power draw near but below TDP.

Memory-bound workloads might show high memory utilization and bandwidth but lower compute utilization. Anomalies such as low utilization with high temperature or power consumption often indicate throttling, inefficient scheduling, or system-level bottlenecks.

Monitoring trends over time rather than single snapshots is critical. Sudden drops in utilization or spikes in errors often reveal underlying issues before they impact production workloads. Comparing metrics across multiple GPUs can also help identify outliers or misbehaving devices in a cluster. Understanding these metrics in combination, rather than isolation, provides the clearest insight into GPU efficiency and workload performance.

## Common GPU metrics

The following NVIDIA DCGM metrics are commonly evaluated for performance of GPU node pools on Kubernetes:

| GPU Metric Name | Meaning | Typical Range / Indicator | Usage Tip |
|---|---|---|---|
`DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL` |
GPU utilization (% time GPU cores are active) | 0–100% (higher is better) | Monitor per-node and per-pod; low values may indicate CPU or I/O bottlenecks |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_SM_UTIL` |
Streaming Multiprocessor efficiency (% active cores) | 0–100% | Low values with high memory usage indicate a memory-bound workload |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` |
Framebuffer memory used (bytes) | 0 to total memory | Use pod GPU memory limits and track per-pod memory usage |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_FREE` |
Free GPU memory (bytes) | 0 to total memory | Useful for scheduling and to avoid OOM errors |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_MEMORY_UTIL` |
Memory utilization (%) | 0–100% | Combine with GPU/SM utilization to determine memory-bound workloads |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_MEMORY_CLOCK` |
Current memory clock frequency (MHz) | 0 to max memory clock | Low values under high memory utilization may indicate throttling |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE` |
Instantaneous power usage (Watts) | 0 to TDP | Drops during high utilization may indicate throttling |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_TEMPERATURE` |
GPU temperature (°C) | ~30–85°C normal | Alert on sustained high temperatures |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_NVLINK_RX` |
NVLink receive bandwidth utilization (%) | 0–100% | Multi-GPU synchronization bottleneck if high with low SM utilization |
`DCGM_FI_DEV_XID_ERRORS` |
GPU critical errors reported by driver | Typically 0 | Immediate investigation required; can taint node in Kubernetes |

# Install existing applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers, such as *APT* and *Yum*, you can use Helm to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This article shows you how to configure and use Helm in a Kubernetes cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Before you begin

- This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Your AKS cluster needs to have
**an integrated ACR**. For details on creating an AKS cluster with an integrated ACR, see[Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration#create-a-new-acr). - You also need the Helm CLI installed, which is the client that runs on your development system. It allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, the Helm CLI is already installed. For installation instructions on your local platform, see
[Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Important

Helm is intended to run on Linux nodes. If you have Windows Server nodes in your cluster, you must ensure that Helm pods are only scheduled to run on Linux nodes. You also need to ensure that any Helm charts you install are also scheduled to run on the correct nodes. The commands in this article use [node-selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) to make sure pods are scheduled to the correct nodes, but not all Helm charts may expose a node selector. You can also consider using other options on your cluster, such as [taints](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler).

## Verify your version of Helm

Use the

`helm version`

command to verify you have Helm 3 installed.`helm version`

The following example output shows Helm version 3.0.0 installed:

`version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.0.0", GitCommit:"e29ce2a54e96cd02ccfce88bee4f58bb6e2a28b6", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.4"}`


## Install an application with Helm v3

### Add Helm repositories

Add the

*ingress-nginx*repository using the[helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/#initialize-a-helm-chart-repository)command.`helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx`


### Find Helm charts

Search for precreated Helm charts using the

[helm search](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-search-finding-charts)command.`helm search repo ingress-nginx`

The following condensed example output shows some of the Helm charts available for use:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx 4.7.0 1.8.0 Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX a...`

Update the list of charts using the

[helm repo update](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-repo-working-with-repositories)command.`helm repo update`

The following example output shows a successful repo update:

`Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories... ...Successfully got an update from the "ingress-nginx" chart repository Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈`


## Import the Helm chart images into your ACR

This article uses the [NGINX ingress controller Helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/charts/ingress-nginx), which relies on three container images.

Use

`az acr import`

to import the NGINX ingress controller images into your ACR.`REGISTRY_NAME=<REGISTRY_NAME> CONTROLLER_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io CONTROLLER_IMAGE=ingress-nginx/controller CONTROLLER_TAG=v1.8.0 PATCH_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io PATCH_IMAGE=ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen PATCH_TAG=v20230407 DEFAULTBACKEND_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE=defaultbackend-amd64 DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG=1.5 az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $CONTROLLER_REGISTRY/$CONTROLLER_IMAGE:$CONTROLLER_TAG --image $CONTROLLER_IMAGE:$CONTROLLER_TAG az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $PATCH_REGISTRY/$PATCH_IMAGE:$PATCH_TAG --image $PATCH_IMAGE:$PATCH_TAG az acr import --name $REGISTRY_NAME --source $DEFAULTBACKEND_REGISTRY/$DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE:$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG --image $DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE:$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG`

Note

In addition to importing container images into your ACR, you can also import Helm charts into your ACR. For more information, see

[Push and pull Helm charts to an Azure container registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-helm-repos).

### Run Helm charts

Install Helm charts using the

[helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-install-installing-a-package)command and specify a release name and the name of the chart to install.Tip

The following example creates a Kubernetes namespace for the ingress resources named

*ingress-basic*and is intended to work within that namespace. Specify a namespace for your own environment as needed.`ACR_URL=<REGISTRY_URL> # Create a namespace for your ingress resources kubectl create namespace ingress-basic # Use Helm to deploy an NGINX ingress controller helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \ --version 4.0.13 \ --namespace ingress-basic \ --set controller.replicaCount=2 \ --set controller.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set controller.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set controller.image.image=$CONTROLLER_IMAGE \ --set controller.image.tag=$CONTROLLER_TAG \ --set controller.image.digest="" \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path"=/healthz \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.image=$PATCH_IMAGE \ --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.image.tag=$PATCH_TAG \ --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \ --set defaultBackend.image.registry=$ACR_URL \ --set defaultBackend.image.image=$DEFAULTBACKEND_IMAGE \ --set defaultBackend.image.tag=$DEFAULTBACKEND_TAG \ --set defaultBackend.image.digest=""`

The following condensed example output shows the deployment status of the Kubernetes resources created by the Helm chart:

`NAME: nginx-ingress LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jul 28 11:35:29 2021 NAMESPACE: ingress-basic STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: The ingress-nginx controller has been installed. It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available. You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace ingress-basic get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller' ...`

Get the

*EXTERNAL-IP*of your service using the`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl --namespace ingress-basic get services -o wide -w ingress-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller`

The following example output shows the

*EXTERNAL-IP*for the*ingress-nginx-ingress-nginx-controller*service:`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller LoadBalancer 10.0.254.93 <EXTERNAL_IP> 80:30004/TCP,443:30348/TCP 61s app.kubernetes.io/component=controller,app.kubernetes.io/instance=nginx-ingress,app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx`


### List releases

Get a list of releases installed on your cluster using the

`helm list`

command.`helm list --namespace ingress-basic`

The following example output shows the

*ingress-nginx*release deployed in the previous step:`NAME NAMESPACE REVISION UPDATED STATUS CHART APP VERSION ingress-nginx ingress-basic 1 2021-07-28 11:35:29.9623734 -0500 CDT deployed ingress-nginx-3.34.0 0.47.0`


### Clean up resources

Deploying a Helm chart creates Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, and services.

Clean up resources using the

[helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-uninstall-uninstalling-a-release)command and specify your release name.`helm uninstall --namespace ingress-basic ingress-nginx`

The following example output shows the release named

*ingress-nginx*has been uninstalled:`release "nginx-ingress" uninstalled`

Delete the entire sample namespace along with the resources using the

`kubectl delete`

command and specify your namespace name.`kubectl delete namespace ingress-basic`
