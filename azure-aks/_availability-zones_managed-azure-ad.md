Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Availability zones](/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) help protect your applications and data from datacenter failures. Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone includes one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

Using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with availability zones physically distributes resources across different availability zones within a single region, improving reliability. Deploying nodes in multiple zones doesn't incur additional costs. For more information on AKS reliability features including availability zones, multi-region configurations, reliability during service maintenance, and backup, see [Reliability in AKS](/en-us/azure/reliability/reliability-aks).

This article shows you how to configure AKS resources to use availability zones.

## AKS resources

This diagram shows the Azure resources that are created when you create an AKS cluster:

### AKS control plane

Microsoft hosts the [AKS control plane](/en-us/azure/aks/core-aks-concepts#control-plane), the Kubernetes API server, and services such as `scheduler`

and `etcd`

as a managed service. Microsoft replicates the control plane in multiple zones.

Other resources of your cluster deploy in a managed resource group in your Azure subscription. By default, this resource group is prefixed with *MC_* for *managed cluster* and contains the resources mentioned in the following sections.

### Node pools

Node pools are created as virtual machine scale sets in your Azure subscription.

When you create an AKS cluster, one [system node pool](/en-us/azure/aks/use-system-pools) is required and is created automatically. It hosts critical system pods such as `CoreDNS`

and `metrics-server`

. You can add more [user node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/create-node-pools) to your AKS cluster to host your applications.

There are three ways node pools can be deployed:

- Zone-spanning
- Zone-aligned
- Regional

The system node pool zones are configured when the cluster or node pool is created.

#### Zone-spanning

In this configuration, nodes are spread across all selected zones. These zones are specified by using the `--zones`

parameter.

```
# Create an AKS cluster, and create a zone-spanning system node pool in all three AZs, one node in each AZ
az aks create --resource-group example-rg --name example-cluster --node-count 3 --zones 1 2 3
# Add one new zone-spanning user node pool, two nodes in each
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-a --node-count 6 --zones 1 2 3
```


AKS automatically balances the number of nodes between zones.

If a zonal outage occurs, nodes within the affected zone might be affected, but nodes in other availability zones remain unaffected.

To validate node locations, run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name, REGION:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/region, ZONE:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone'
```


```
NAME REGION ZONE
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000000 eastus eastus-1
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000001 eastus eastus-2
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000002 eastus eastus-3
```


#### Zone-aligned

In this configuration, each node is aligned (pinned) to a specific zone. To create three node pools for a region with three availability zones:

```
# # Add three new zone-aligned user node pools, two nodes in each
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-x --node-count 2 --zones 1
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-y --node-count 2 --zones 2
az aks nodepool add --resource-group example-rg --cluster-name example-cluster --name userpool-z --node-count 2 --zones 3
```


This configuration can be used when you need [lower latency between nodes](/en-us/azure/aks/reduce-latency-ppg). It also provides more granular control over scaling operations, or when you're using the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview).

Note

If a single workload is deployed across node pools, we recommend setting `--balance-similar-node-groups`

to `true`

to maintain a balanced distribution of nodes across zones for your workloads during scale-up operations.

#### Regional (not using availability zones)

Regional mode is used when the zone assignment isn't set in the deployment template (for example, `"zones"=[]`

or `"zones"=null`

).

In this configuration, the node pool creates regional (not zone-pinned) instances and implicitly places instances throughout the region. There's no guarantee that instances are balanced or spread across zones, or that instances are in the same availability zone.

In the rare case of a full zonal outage, any or all instances within the node pool might be affected.

To validate node locations, run the following command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o custom-columns='NAME:metadata.name, REGION:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/region, ZONE:metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone'
```


```
NAME REGION ZONE
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000000 eastus 0
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000001 eastus 0
aks-nodepool1-34917322-vmss000002 eastus 0
```


## Deployments

### Pods

Kubernetes is aware of Azure availability zones, and can balance pods across nodes in different zones. In the event a zone becomes unavailable, Kubernetes moves pods away from affected nodes automatically.

As documented in the Kubernetes reference [Well-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/), Kubernetes uses the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`

label to automatically distribute pods in a replication controller or service across the various available zones available.

To see which pods and nodes are running, run the following command:

```
kubectl describe pod | grep -e "^Name:" -e "^Node:"
```


The `maxSkew`

parameter describes the degree to which pods might be unevenly distributed. Assuming three zones and three replicas, setting this value to `1`

ensures that each zone has at least one pod running:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: my-deployment
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: my-app
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: my-app
spec:
topologySpreadConstraints:
- maxSkew: 1
topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
labelSelector:
matchLabels:
app: my-app
containers:
- name: my-container
image: my-image
```


### Storage and volumes

By default, Kubernetes versions 1.29 and later use Azure Managed Disks by using zone-redundant storage for Persistent Volume Claims.

These disks are replicated between zones, to enhance the resilience of your applications. This action helps to safeguard your data against datacenter failures.

The following example shows a Persistent Volume Claim that uses Azure Standard SSD in zone-redundant storage:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteOnce
storageClassName: managed-csi
#storageClassName: managed-csi-premium
resources:
requests:
storage: 5Gi
```


For zone-aligned deployments, you can create a new storage class with the `skuname`

parameter set to `LRS`

(locally redundant storage). You can then use the new storage class in your Persistent Volume Claim.

Although locally redundant storage disks are less expensive, they aren't zone-redundant, and attaching a disk to a node in a different zone isn't supported.

The following example shows a locally redundant storage Standard SSD storage class:

```
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: azuredisk-csi-standard-lrs
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
parameters:
skuname: StandardSSD_LRS
#skuname: PremiumV2_LRS
```


### Load balancers

Kubernetes deploys Azure Standard Load Balancer by default, which balances inbound traffic across all zones in a region. If a node becomes unavailable, the load balancer reroutes traffic to healthy nodes.

An example service that uses Azure Load Balancer:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: example
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
selector:
app: myapp
ports:
- port: 80
targetPort: 8080
```


Important

On September 30, 2025, Basic Load Balancer will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). If you use Basic Load Balancer, make sure to [upgrade](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-basic-upgrade-guidance) to Standard Load Balancer before the retirement date.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you're using availability zones:

- See
[Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes). - The number of availability zones used
*can't be changed*after the node pool is created. - Most regions support availability zones.
[See a list of regions](/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list).

# Enable AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration for Kubernetes clusters with kubelogin

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration simplifies the Microsoft Entra integration process. Previously, you were required to create a client and server app, and the Microsoft Entra tenant had to assign [Directory Readers](/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-readers) role permissions. Now, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resource provider manages the client and server apps for you.

Cluster administrators can configure Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) based on a user's identity or directory group membership. Microsoft Entra authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID Connect, see the [OpenID Connect documentation](/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc).

Learn more about the Microsoft Entra integration flow in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](concepts-identity#azure-ad-integration).

## Limitations

The following are constraints to integrate authentication on AKS:

- Integration can't be disabled after being added.
- Downgrades from an integrated cluster to the legacy Microsoft Entra ID clusters aren't supported.
- Clusters without Kubernetes RBAC support are unable to add the integration.

## Before you begin

To install the AKS addon, verify you have the following items:

- You have Azure CLI version 2.29.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need
`kubectl`

with a minimum version of[1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1181)or. With the Azure CLI and the Azure PowerShell module, these two commands are included and automatically managed. Meaning, they're upgraded by default and running`kubelogin`

`az aks install-cli`

isn't required or recommended. If you're using an automated pipeline, you need to manage upgrades for the correct or latest version. The difference between the minor versions of Kubernetes and`kubectl`

shouldn't be more than*one*version. Otherwise, authentication issues occur on the wrong version. - If you're using
[helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), you need a minimum version of helm 3.3. - This configuration requires you have a Microsoft Entra group for your cluster. This group is registered as an admin group on the cluster to grant admin permissions. If you don't have an existing Microsoft Entra group, you can create one using the
command.`az ad group create`


Note

Microsoft Entra integrated clusters using a Kubernetes version newer than version 1.24 automatically use the `kubelogin`

format. Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.24, the default format of the `clusterUser`

credential for Microsoft Entra ID clusters is `exec`

, which requires [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) binary in the execution

`PATH`

. There's no behavior change for non-Microsoft Entra clusters, or Microsoft Entra ID clusters running a version older than 1.24.
Existing downloaded `kubeconfig`

continues to work. An optional query parameter `format`

is included when getting `clusterUser`

credential to overwrite the default behavior change. You can explicitly specify format to `azure`

if you need to maintain the old `kubeconfig`

format.## Enable the integration on your AKS cluster

### Create a new cluster

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location centralus`

Create an AKS cluster and enable administration access for your Microsoft Entra group using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myManagedCluster \ --enable-aad \ --aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> \ --aad-tenant-id <id> \ --generate-ssh-keys`

A successful creation of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body.

`"AADProfile": { "adminGroupObjectIds": [ "aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb" ], "clientAppId": null, "managed": true, "serverAppId": null, "serverAppSecret": null, "tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee" }`


### Use an existing cluster

Enable AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration on your existing Kubernetes RBAC enabled cluster using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command. Make sure to set your admin group to keep access on your cluster.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name myManagedCluster \
--enable-aad \
--aad-admin-group-object-ids <id-1>,<id-2> \
--aad-tenant-id <id>
```


A successful activation of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body:

```
"AADProfile": {
"adminGroupObjectIds": [
"aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
],
"clientAppId": null,
"managed": true,
"serverAppId": null,
"serverAppSecret": null,
"tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
}
```


### Migrate legacy cluster to integration

If your cluster uses legacy Microsoft Entra integration, you can upgrade to AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration through the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command.

Warning

Free tier clusters might experience API server downtime during the upgrade. We recommend upgrading during your nonbusiness hours.
After the upgrade, the `kubeconfig`

content changes. You need to run `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <AKS resource group name> --name <AKS cluster name>`

to merge the new credentials into the `kubeconfig`

file.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myManagedCluster \
--enable-aad \
--aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> \
--aad-tenant-id <id>
```


A successful migration of an AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID cluster has the following section in the response body:

```
"AADProfile": {
"adminGroupObjectIds": [
"aaaaaaaa-0000-1111-2222-bbbbbbbbbbbb"
],
"clientAppId": null,
"managed": true,
"serverAppId": null,
"serverAppSecret": null,
"tenantId": "aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee"
}
```


## Access your enabled cluster

Get the user credentials to access your cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster`

Follow your sign in instructions.

Set

`kubelogin`

to use the Azure CLI.`kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli`

View the nodes in the cluster with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`


## Non-interactive sign-in with kubelogin

There are some non-interactive scenarios that don't support `kubectl`

. In these cases, use [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) to connect to the cluster with a non-interactive service principal credential to perform continuous integration pipelines.

Note

Microsoft Entra integrated clusters using a Kubernetes version newer than version 1.24 automatically use the `kubelogin`

format. Beginning with Kubernetes version 1.24, the default format of the `clusterUser`

credential for Microsoft Entra ID clusters is `exec`

, which requires [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) binary in the execution PATH. There's no behavior change for non-Microsoft Entra clusters, or Microsoft Entra ID clusters running a version older than 1.24.
Existing downloaded

`kubeconfig`

continues to work. An optional query parameter `format`

is included when getting `clusterUser`

credential to overwrite the default behavior change. You can explicitly specify format to `azure`

if you need to maintain the old `kubeconfig`

format.When getting the `clusterUser`

credential, you can use the `format`

query parameter to overwrite the default behavior. You can set the value to `azure`

to use the original `kubeconfig`

format:

```
az aks get-credentials --format azure
```


If your Microsoft Entra integrated cluster uses Kubernetes version 1.24 or lower, you need to manually convert the `kubeconfig`

format.

```
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig
```


If you receive the message **error: The Azure auth plugin has been removed.**, you need to run the command `kubelogin convert-kubeconfig`

to convert the `kubeconfig`

format manually. For more information, see [Azure Kubelogin Known Issues](https://azure.github.io/kubelogin/known-issues.html).

## Troubleshoot access issues

Important

The step described in this section suggests an alternative authentication method compared to the normal Microsoft Entra group authentication. Use this option only in an emergency.

If you lack administrative access to a valid Microsoft Entra group, you can follow this workaround. Sign in with an account that is a member of the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-admin-role) role and grant your group or tenant admin credentials to access your cluster.

## Next steps

- Learn about
[Microsoft Entra integration with Kubernetes RBAC](azure-ad-rbac). - Learn more about
[AKS and Kubernetes identity concepts](concepts-identity). - Learn how to
[use kubelogin](kubelogin-authentication)for all supported Microsoft Entra authentication methods in AKS. - Use
[Azure Resource Manager templates](/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters)to create AKS-managed Microsoft Entra ID enabled clusters.
