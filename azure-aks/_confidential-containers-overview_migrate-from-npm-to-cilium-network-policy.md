Important

The Confidential Containers preview is set to sunset in **March 2026**. After this date, customers with existing Confidential Container node pools should expect to see reduced functionality, and you won't be able to spin up any new nodes with the `KataCcIsolation`

runtime. Customers currently using Confidential Container node pools can continue using them as normal. If you want to move off Confidential Containers, consider the following alternatives:

[Confidential VMs on AKS](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-node-pool-aks): Offers a similar hardware-based TEE that leverages AMD SEV-SNP security features, without the addition of per-VM isolation for workloads seen in Confidential Containers.[Application enclave support](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-nodes-aks-overview): Provides users with Intel SGX confidential computing VM nodes that support hardware-based, process-level container isolation through the Intel SGX trusted execution environment.[Confidential Containers on Azure Container Instances](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-containers): Allows for lift-and-shift deployments on containers backed by AMD SEV-SNP. Functionality includes performing full guest attestation, access to toolings to generate policies, and utilizing sidecar containers for secure key releases. ACI nodes can be run on AKS via[virtual nodes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-virtual-nodes).[Azure RedHat OpenShift Confidential Containers](/en-us/azure/openshift/confidential-containers-overview): Offers a similar AMD SEV-SNP backed TEE and utilizes the Kata runtime for per-container level isolation.[Open source Confidential Containers](https://github.com/confidential-containers): Gives a similar AMD SEV-SNP backed TEE that comes with per-container isolation through Kata.

If you have additional questions, please create a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) or post an issue in [AKS issues](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Confidential Containers provide a set of features and capabilities to further secure your standard container workloads to achieve higher data security, data privacy and runtime code integrity goals. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) includes Confidential Containers (preview) on AKS.

Confidential Containers builds on Kata Confidential Containers and hardware-based encryption to encrypt container memory. It establishes a new level of data confidentiality by preventing data in memory during computation from being in clear text, readable format. Trust is earned in the container through hardware attestation, allowing access to the encrypted data by trusted entities.

Together with [Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing), you can run sensitive workloads isolated in Azure to protect your data and workloads. What makes a container confidential:

- Transparency: The confidential container environment where your sensitive application is shared, you can see and verify if it's safe. All components of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) are to be open sourced.
- Auditability: You have the ability to verify and see what version of the CoCo environment package including Linux Guest OS and all the components are current. Microsoft signs to the guest OS and container runtime environment for verifications through attestation. It also releases a secure hash algorithm (SHA) of guest OS builds to build a string audibility and control story.
- Full attestation: Anything that is part of the TEE shall be fully measured by the CPU with ability to verify remotely. The hardware report from AMD SEV-SNP processor shall reflect container layers and container runtime configuration hash through the attestation claims. Application can fetch the hardware report locally including the report that reflects Guest OS image and container runtime.
- Code integrity: Runtime enforcement is always available through customer defined policies for containers and container configuration, such as immutable policies and container signing.
- Isolation from operator: Security designs that assume least privilege and highest isolation shielding from all untrusted parties including customer/tenant admins. It includes hardening existing Kubernetes control plane access (kubelet) to confidential pods.

With other security measures or data protection controls, as part of your overall architecture, these capabilities help you meet regulatory, industry, or governance compliance requirements for securing sensitive information.

This article helps you understand the Confidential Containers feature, and how to implement and configure the following:

- Deploy or upgrade an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI
- Add an annotation to your pod YAML to mark the pod as being run as a confidential container
- Add a
[security policy](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-containers-aks-security-policy)to your pod YAML - Deploy your application in confidential computing

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported scenarios

Confidential Containers (preview) are appropriate for deployment scenarios that involve sensitive data. For example, personally identifiable information (PII) or any data with strong security needed for regulatory compliance. Some common scenarios with containers are:

- Run big data analytics using Apache Spark for fraud pattern recognition in the financial sector.
- Running self-hosted GitHub runners to securely sign code as part of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) DevOps practices.
- Machine Learning inferencing and training of ML models using an encrypted data set from a trusted source. It only decrypts inside a confidential container environment to preserve privacy.
- Building big data clean rooms for ID matching as part of multi-party computation in industries like retail with digital advertising.
- Building confidential computing Zero Trust landing zones to meet privacy regulations for application migrations to cloud.

## Considerations

The following are considerations with this preview of Confidential Containers:

- An increase in pod startup time compared to runc pods and kernel-isolated pods.
- Version 1 container images aren't supported.
- Ephemeral containers and other troubleshooting methods like
`exec`

into a container, log outputs from containers, and`stdio`

require a policy modification and redeployment to enable ExecProcessRequest, ReadStreamRequest, WriteStreamRequest, and CloseStdinRequest. - Due to container image layer measurements being encoded in the security policy, we don't recommend using the
`latest`

tag when specifying containers. - Services, Load Balancers, and EndpointSlices only support the TCP protocol.
- The policy generator only supports pods that use IPv4 addresses.
- Pod environment variables based on ConfigMaps and Secrets can't be changed after the pod is deployed.
- Pod termination logs aren't supported. While pods write termination logs to
`/dev/termination-log`

or to a custom location if specified in the pod manifest, the host/kubelet can't read those logs. Changes from the pod to that file aren't reflected on the host. - Confidential Containers currently only supports Azure Linux.

## Resource allocation overview

It's important you understand the memory and processor resource allocation behavior in this release.

- CPU: The shim assigns one vCPU to the base OS inside the pod. If no resource
`limits`

are specified, the workloads don't have separate CPU shares assigned, the vCPU is then shared with that workload. If CPU limits are specified, CPU shares are explicitly allocated for workloads. - Memory: The Kata-CC handler uses 2 GB memory for the UVM OS and X MB additional memory where X is the resource
`limits`

if specified in the YAML manifest (resulting in a 2-GB VM when no limit is given, without implicit memory for containers). The[Kata](https://katacontainers.io/docs/)handler uses 256 MB base memory for the UVM OS and X MB additional memory when resource`limits`

are specified in the YAML manifest. If limits are unspecified, an implicit limit of 1,792 MB is added resulting in a 2 GB VM and 1,792 MB implicit memory for containers.

In this release, specifying resource requests in the pod manifests isn't supported. containerd doesn't pass the requests to the Kata Shim, and as a result, reserving resources based on the pod manifest resource requests is not implemented. Use resource `limits`

instead of resource `requests`

to allocate memory or CPU resources for workloads or containers.

With the local container filesystem backed by VM memory, writing to the container filesystem (including logging) can fill up the available memory provided to the pod. This condition can result in potential pod crashes.

# Migrate from Network Policy Manager (NPM) to Cilium Network Policy

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide to plan, execute, and validate the migration from Network Policy Manager (NPM) to Cilium Network Policy. The goal is to ensure policy parity, minimize service disruption, and align with Azure CNI's strategic direction toward eBPF-based networking and enhanced observability.

Important

This guide applies exclusively to AKS clusters running Linux nodes. Cilium Network Policy isn't currently supported for Windows nodes in AKS.

## Key considerations before you begin

- Policy Compatibility: NPM and Cilium differ in enforcement models. Before migration you need to validate that existing policies are compatible or identify required changes. Refer to the Pre-Migration Validation section for guidance.
- Downtime Expectations: Policy enforcement might be temporarily inconsistent during node reimaging.
- Windows Node Pools: Cilium Network Policy isn't currently supported for Windows nodes in AKS.

## Pre-migration validation

Before migrating from Network Policy Manager (NPM) to Cilium Network Policy, it's important to assess the compatibility of your existing network policies. While most policies continue to function as expected post-migration, there are specific scenarios where behavior might differ between NPM and Cilium. These differences could require updates to your policies either before or after the migration to ensure consistent enforcement and avoid unintended traffic drops. In this section, we outline known scenarios where policy adjustments might be necessary. We explain why it matters, and provide guidance on what actions—if any—are required to make your policies Cilium-compatible.

### NetworkPolicy with endPort

Note

Cilium started supporting the `endPort`

field in Kubernetes NetworkPolicy in version 1.17.

The endPort field allows you to define a range of ports in a single rule, rather than specifying individual ports.

Here's an example of a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy that uses the endPort field:

```
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 32000
endPort: 32768
```


**Action Required:**

- If your AKS cluster is running Cilium version 1.17 or later, no changes are needed as endPort is fully supported.
- If your cluster is running a Cilium version earlier than 1.17, remove the endPort field from any policies before migrating. Use explicit single-port entries instead.

### NetworkPolicy with ipBlock

The ipBlock field in Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allows you to define CIDR ranges for ingress sources or egress destinations. These ranges can include external IPs, Pod IPs, or Node IPs. However, Cilium doesn't allow egress to Pod or Node IPs using ipBlock, even if those IPs fall within the specified CIDR range.

For example, the following NetworkPolicy uses an ipBlock to allow all egress traffic to 0.0.0.0/0:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: example-ipblock
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
```


- Under NPM, this policy would allow egress to all destinations, including Pods and Nodes.
- After migrating to Cilium, egress to Pod and Node IPs will be blocked, even though they fall within the 0.0.0.0/0 range.

**Action Required:**

- To allow traffic to Pod IPs, before migration replace the ipBlock with a combination of namespaceSelector and podSelector.

Here's an example of using namespaceSelector and podSelector:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: example-ipblock
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
- namespaceSelector: {}
- podSelector: {}
```


- For Node IPs, there's no pre-migration workaround. After migration, you must create a CiliumNetworkPolicy that explicitly allows egress to the host and/or remote-node entities. Until this policy is in place, egress traffic to Node IPs is blocked.

Here's an example of CiliumNetworkPolicy to allow traffic from/to local and remote nodes:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-node-egress
namespace: ipblock-test
spec:
endpointSelector: {} # Applies to all pods in the namespace
egress:
- toEntities:
- host # host allows traffic from/to the local node's host network namespace
- remote-node # remote-node allows traffic from/to the remote node's host network namespace
```


### NetworkPolicy with named Ports

Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allows you to reference ports by name instead of number. If you're using named ports in your NetworkPolicies, Cilium might fail to enforce rules correctly and lead to unexpected traffic being blocked. This issue happens when the same port name is used for different ports.
For more information, see [Cilium GitHub issue #30003](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/30003).

Here's an example of NetworkPolicy uses Named port to allow egress traffic:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
annotations:
name: allow-egress
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
network-rules-egress: cilium-np-test
egress:
- ports:
- port: http-test # Named port
protocol: TCP
policyTypes:
- Egress
```


**Action Required:**

- Before migration, replace all named ports in your policies with their corresponding numeric values.

### NetworkPolicy with Egress Policies

Kubernetes NetworkPolicy on NPM doesn't block egress traffic from a pod to its own node's IP, this traffic is implicitly allowed. After you migrate to Cilium, this behavior will change, and traffic to local nodes that was previously allowed will be blocked unless explicitly allowed.

For example, the following policy allows egress only to an internal API subnet:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-egress
namespace: default
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Egress
egress:
- to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 10.20.30.0/24
```


- With NPM: Egress traffic to 10.20.30.0/24 is allowed explicitly, and egress traffic to the local node is allowed implicitly.
- With Cilium: Only traffic to 10.20.30.0/24 is allowed; egress to the node IP is blocked unless you permit it explicitly.

**Action Required:**

- Review all existing egress policies for your workloads.
- If your applications rely on NPM's implicit allow behavior for egress to the local node, you must add explicit egress rules to maintain connectivity after migration.
- You can add a CiliumNetworkPolicy after migration to explicitly allow egress traffic to the local host.

### Ingress policy behavior changes

Under Network Policy Manager (NPM), ingress traffic arriving via a LoadBalancer or NodePort service with "externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster" - which is the default setting - isn't subject to ingress policy enforcement. This behavior means that even if a pod has a restrictive ingress policy, traffic from external sources might still reach it via loadbalancer or nodeport services.

In contrast, Cilium enforces ingress policies on all traffic, including traffic routed internally due to externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster. As a result, after migration, traffic that was previously allowed might be dropped if the appropriate ingress rules aren't explicitly defined.

For example, Customer creates a network policy to deny all in ingress traffic

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
podSelector: {}
policyTypes:
- Ingress
```


- With NPM: Direct connection to the pod or via ClusterIP service is blocked. However, access through NodePort or LoadBalancer is still allowed despite the deny-all policy.
- With Cilium: All ingress traffic is blocked, including traffic via NodePort or LoadBalancer, unless explicitly allowed.

**Action Required:**

- Review all ingress policies for workloads behind LoadBalancer or NodePort services using externalTrafficPolicy=Cluster.
- Ensure that ingress rules explicitly allow traffic from the expected external sources (for example, IP ranges, namespaces, or labels).
- If your policy currently relies on the implicit allow behavior under NPM, you must add explicit ingress rules to maintain connectivity after migration.

## Upgrade to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

To use Cilium Network Policy, your AKS cluster must be running Azure CNI powered by Cilium. When you enable Cilium in a cluster currently using NPM, the existing NPM engine is automatically uninstalled and replaced with Cilium.

Warning

The upgrade process triggers each node pool to be reimaged simultaneously. Upgrading each node pool separately isn't supported. Any disruptions to cluster networking are similar to a node image upgrade or [Kubernetes version upgrade](upgrade-cluster) where each node in a node pool is reimaged. Cilium will begin enforcing network policies only after all nodes are reimaged.

Important

These instructions apply to clusters upgrading from Azure CNI to Azure CNI with the Cilium dataplane. Upgrades from bring-your-own CNIs or changes the IPAM mode aren't covered here. For more information, see [Upgrade Azure CNI documentation](update-azure-cni).

To perform the upgrade, you need Azure CLI version 2.52.0 or later. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Use the following command to upgrade an existing cluster to Azure CNI Powered by Cilium. Replace the values for `clusterName`

and `resourceGroupName`

:

```
az aks update --name <clusterName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --network-dataplane cilium
```
