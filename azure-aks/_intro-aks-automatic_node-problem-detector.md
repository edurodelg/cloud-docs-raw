Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

**Applies to:** ✔️ AKS Automatic

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Automatic offers an experience that makes the most common tasks on Kubernetes fast and frictionless, while preserving the flexibility, extensibility, and consistency of Kubernetes. Azure takes care of your cluster setup, including node management, scaling, security, and preconfigured settings that follow AKS well-architected recommendations. Automatic clusters dynamically allocate compute resources based on your specific workload requirements and are tuned for running production applications.

**Production ready by default**: Clusters are preconfigured for optimal production use, suitable for most applications. They offer fully managed node pools that automatically allocate and scale resources based on your workload needs. Pods are bin packed efficiently, to maximize resource utilization.**Built-in best practices and safeguards**: AKS Automatic clusters have a hardened default configuration, with many cluster, application, and networking security settings enabled by default. AKS automatically patches your nodes and cluster components while adhering to any planned maintenance schedules.**Code to Kubernetes in minutes**: Go from a container image to a deployed application that adheres to best practices patterns within minutes, with access to the comprehensive capabilities of the Kubernetes API and its rich ecosystem.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## AKS Automatic and Standard feature comparison

The following table provides a comparison of options that are available, preconfigured, and default in both AKS Automatic and AKS Standard. For more information on whether specific features are available in Automatic, you can check the documentation for that feature.

**Preconfigured** features are always enabled and you can't disable or change their settings. **Default** features are configured for you but can be changed. **Optional** features are available for you to configure and aren't enabled by default.

When enabling optional features, you can follow the linked feature documentation. When you reach a step for cluster creation, follow steps to create an [AKS Automatic cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-automatic-deploy) instead of creating an AKS Standard cluster.

### Application deployment, monitoring, and observability

Application deployment can be streamlined using [automated deployments](automated-deployments) from source control, which creates Kubernetes manifest and generates CI/CD workflows. Additionally, the cluster is configured with monitoring tools such as Managed Prometheus for metrics, Managed Grafana for visualization, and Container Insights for log collection.

| Option | AKS Automatic | AKS Standard |

### Node management, scaling, and cluster operations

Node management is automatically handled without the need for manual node pool creation. Scaling is seamless, with nodes created based on workload requests. Additionally, features for workload scaling like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), [Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](keda-about), and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](vertical-pod-autoscaler) are enabled. Clusters are configured for automatic node repair, automatic cluster upgrades, and detection of deprecated Kubernetes standard API usage. You can also set a planned maintenance schedule for upgrades if needed.

### Security and policies

Cluster authentication and authorization use [Azure Role-based Access Control (RBAC) for Kubernetes authorization](manage-azure-rbac) and applications can use features like [workload identity with Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview) and [OpenID Connect (OIDC) cluster issuer](use-oidc-issuer) to have secure communication with Azure services. [Deployment safeguards](deployment-safeguards) enforce Kubernetes best practices through Azure Policy controls and the built-in [image cleaner](image-cleaner) removes unused images with vulnerabilities, enhancing image security.

### Networking

AKS Automatic clusters use [managed Virtual Network powered by Azure CNI Overlay with Cilium](azure-cni-powered-by-cilium) for high-performance networking and robust security. Ingress is handled by [managed NGINX using the application routing add-on](app-routing), integrating seamlessly with Azure DNS and Azure Key Vault. Egress uses a [managed NAT gateway](nat-gateway#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-managed-nat-gateway) for scalable outbound connections. Additionally, you have the flexibility to enable [Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS](istio-about) or bring your own service mesh.

# Node Problem Detector (NPD) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Node Problem Detector (NPD)](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) is an open source Kubernetes component that detects node-related problems and reports on them. It runs as a systemd serviced on each node in the cluster and collects various metrics and system information, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network connectivity. When it detects a problem, it generates *events and/or node conditions*. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses NPD to monitor and manage nodes in a Kubernetes cluster running on the Azure cloud platform. The AKS Linux extension enables NPD by default.

Note

Upgrades to NPD are independent of the node image and Kubernetes version upgrade processes. If a node pool is unhealthy (that is, in a failed state), new NPD versions aren't installed.

## Node conditions

Node conditions indicate a permanent problem that makes the node unavailable. AKS uses the following node conditions from NPD to expose permanent problems on the node. NPD also emits corresponding Kubernetes events.

| Problem Daemon type | NodeCondition | Reason | Compute type |
|---|---|---|---|
| CustomPluginMonitor | FilesystemCorruptionProblem | FilesystemCorruptionDetected | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | KubeletProblem | KubeletIsDown | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | ContainerRuntimeProblem | ContainerRuntimeIsDown | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | VMEventScheduled | VMEventScheduled | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentUnregisterNetDevice | UnregisterNetDevice | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentKubeletRestart | FrequentKubeletRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentContainerdRestart | FrequentContainerdRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | FrequentDockerRestart | FrequentDockerRestart | General purpose |
| CustomPluginMonitor | GPUMissing | Observed GPU count does not match expected GPU count | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | NVLinkStatusInactive | NVLinkStatusInactive | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | XIDErrors | XID errors present in kernel log | GPU only |
| CustomPluginMonitor | IBLinkFlapping | Intermittent InfiniBand device connectivity | GPU only |
| SystemLogMonitor | KernelDeadlock | DockerHung | General purpose |
| SystemLogMonitor | ReadonlyFilesystem | FilesystemIsReadOnly | General purpose |

Note

The `GPU only`

node conditions currently apply to AKS node pools with `Standard_ND96asr_v4`

or `Standard_ND96isr_H100_v5`

VM size, and are supported on standard GPU and [MIG-enabled GPU node pools](gpu-multi-instance).

## Events

NPD emits events with relevant information to help you diagnose underlying issues.

| Problem Daemon type | Reason | Frequency | Description | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CustomPluginMonitor | EgressBlocked | 30 min | This event checks for connectivity to external

For more information about the events and actions, see [Node autodrain](/en-us/azure/aks/node-auto-repair#node-auto-drain).

### EgressBlocked

The list of endpoints checked by the EgressBlocked are listed below

Note

The actual endpoints will depend on the type of the cluster and the location where it's hosted (Public cloud vs Airgapped clouds). Review the documentation for outbound access [here](/en-us/azure/aks/outbound-rules-control-egress). The documentation is for public clouds

| Type | Example | Note |
|---|---|---|
| MCR |

## Check the node conditions and events

Check the node conditions and events using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node my-aks-node`

Your output should look similar to the following example condensed output:

These events are also available in [Container Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) through [KubeEvents](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/kubeevents).

## Metrics

NPD also exposes Prometheus metrics based on the node problems, which you can use for monitoring and alerting. These metrics are exposed on port 20257 of the Node IP and Prometheus can scrape them.

The following example YAML shows a scrape config you can use with the [Azure Managed Prometheus add on as a DaemonSet](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration#advanced-setup-configure-custom-prometheus-scrape-jobs-for-the-daemonset):

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: ama-metrics-prometheus-config-node
namespace: kube-system
data:
prometheus-config: |-
global:
scrape_interval: 1m
scrape_configs:
- job_name: node-problem-detector
scrape_interval: 1m
scheme: http
metrics_path: /metrics
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__metrics_path__]
regex: (.*)
target_label: metrics_path
- source_labels: [__address__]
replacement: '$NODE_NAME'
target_label: instance
static_configs:
- targets: ['$NODE_IP:20257']
```


The following example shows the scraped metrics:

```
problem_gauge{reason="UnregisterNetDevice",type="FrequentUnregisterNetDevice"} 0
problem_gauge{reason="VMEventScheduled",type="VMEventScheduled"} 0
```
