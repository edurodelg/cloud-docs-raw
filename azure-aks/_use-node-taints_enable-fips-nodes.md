Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

The AKS scheduling mechanism is responsible for placing pods onto nodes and is based upon the upstream Kubernetes scheduler, [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/). You can constrain a pod to run on particular nodes by attaching the pods to a set of nodes using [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or by instructing the node to repel a set of pods using [node taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/), which interact with the AKS scheduler.

Node taints work by marking a node so that the scheduler avoids placing certain pods on the marked nodes. You can place [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) on a pod to allow the scheduler to schedule that pod on a node with a matching taint. Taints and tolerations work together to help you control how the scheduler places pods onto nodes. For more information, see [example use cases of taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases:%7E:text=not%20be%20evicted.-,Example%20Use%20Cases,-Taints%20and%20tolerations).

Taints are key-value pairs with an [effect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/). There are three values for the effect field when using node taints: `NoExecute`

, `NoSchedule`

, and `PreferNoSchedule`

.

`NoExecute`

: Pods already running on the node are immediately evicted if they don't have a matching toleration. If a pod has a matching toleration, it might be evicted if`tolerationSeconds`

are specified.`NoSchedule`

: Only pods with a matching toleration are placed on this node. Existing pods aren't evicted.`PreferNoSchedule`

: The scheduler avoids placing any pods that don't have a matching toleration.

### Node taint options

There are two types of node taints that can be applied to your AKS nodes: **node taints** and **node initialization taints**.

**Node taints**are meant to remain permanently on the node for scheduling pods with node affinity. Node taints can only be added, updated, or removed completely using the AKS API.**Node initialization taints**are placed on the node at boot time and are meant to be used temporarily, such as in scenarios where you might need extra time to set up your nodes. You can remove node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API and they aren't guaranteed during the node lifecycle. They will appear on new replicas of the node when it is scaled up or on all replicas when a node is upgraded. If you want to remove the initialization taints completely, you can remove them using the AKS API after untainting the nodes using the Kubernetes API. Once you remove the initialization taints from the cluster spec using the AKS API, newly created nodes don't come up with those initialization taints. If the initialization taint is still present on existing nodes, you can permanently remove it by performing a node image upgrade operation.

Note

Node taints and labels applied using the AKS node pool API aren't modifiable from the Kubernetes API and vice versa. Modifications to system taints aren't allowed.

This doesn't apply to node initialization taints.

## Use node taints

### Prerequisites

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a node pool with a node taint

Create a node pool with a taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool add`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


### Update a node pool to add a node taint

Update a node pool to add a node taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool update`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


## Use node initialization taints (preview)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Prerequisites and limitations

- You need the Azure CLI version
`3.0.0b3`

or later installed and configured. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can only apply initialization taints via cluster create or upgrade when using the AKS API. If using ARM template that will result in a Managed Cluster level operation, you can specify node initialization taints during node pool creation and update. Agentpool level operations are blocked when
`NodeInitializationTaints`

are present in the request body. - You can't apply initialization taints to Windows node pools using the Azure CLI.

### Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a cluster with a node initialization taint

Create a cluster with a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks create`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

The node initialization taints you specify apply to all of the node pools in the cluster. To apply the initialization taint to a specific node, you can use an ARM template instead of the CLI.

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint

Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

When updating a cluster with a node initialization taint, the taints apply to all node pools in the cluster. If your nodes are using VMSS, you can view updates to node initialization taints on the node after the node's VMSS model is updated (for example, after a node image version upgrade operation). Initialization taints will not appear on your nodes until an operation that triggers a VMSS model update occurs.

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`


## Check the status of the node pool

After applying the node taint or initialization taint, check the status of the node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`

If you applied node initialization taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeInitializationTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeInitializationTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`


## Check that the taint is set on the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool has the specified`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: sku=gpu:NoSchedule ... ], ... ... ]`


Important

If your nodes are using VMSS, node initialization taints will not be visible on actual nodes in your cluster until an operation that triggers VMSS model update occurs (for example, Kubernetes version upgrade or node image version upgrade).

## Remove node taints

### Remove a specific node taint

Remove node taints using the

command. The following example command removes the`az aks nodepool update`

`"sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`

node taint from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


### Remove all node taints

Remove all node taints from a node pool using the

command. The following example command removes all node taints from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


## Remove node initialization taints

You have the following options to remove node initialization taints from the node:

**Remove node initialization taints temporarily**using the Kubernetes API. If you remove them this way, the taints reappear after node scaling or upgrade occurs. New nodes still have the node initialization taint after scaling. Node initialization taints appear on all nodes after upgrading.**Remove node initialization taints permanently**by untainting the node using the Kubernetes API, and then removing the taint using the AKS API. Once the initialization taints are removed from cluster spec using AKS API, newly created nodes after reimage operations no longer have initialization taints.

When you remove all initialization taint occurrences from node pool replicas, the existing initialization taint might reappear after an upgrade with any new initialization taints.

### Remove node initialization taints temporarily

Remove node initialization taints temporarily using the

`kubectl taint nodes`

command.This command removes the taint from only the specified node. If you want to remove the taint from every node in the node pool, you need to run the command for every node that you want the taint removed from.

`kubectl taint nodes $NODE_POOL_NAME sku=gpu:NoSchedule-`

Once removed, node initialization taints reappear after node scaling or upgrading occurs.


### Remove node initialization taints permanently

Follow steps in

[Remove node initialization taints temporarily](#remove-node-initialization-taints-temporarily)to remove the node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API.Remove the taint from the node using the AKS API using the

command. This command removes the node initialization taint from every node in the cluster.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints ""`


## Check that the taint has been removed from the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you removed a node taint, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool doesn't have the removed taint under`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: ... ], ... ... ]`

# Enable Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 is a US government standard that defines minimum security requirements for cryptographic modules in information technology products and systems. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows you to create Linux and Windows node pools with FIPS 140-2 enabled. Deployments running on FIPS-enabled node pools can use those cryptographic modules to provide increased security and help meet security controls as part of FedRAMP compliance. For more information on FIPS 140-2, see [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140](/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fips-140-2).

Caution

In this article, there are references to a feature that may be using Ubuntu OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS.

- Starting on March 17, 2027, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools.
[Upgrade your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to kubernetes version 1.35+ to migrate to a supported Ubuntu version. For more information on this retirement, see[AKS GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues)

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.32.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run `az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Note

AKS Monitoring Addon supports FIPS enabled node pools with Ubuntu, Azure Linux, and Windows starting with Agent version 3.1.17 (Linux) and Win-3.1.17 (Windows).

## Limitations

- FIPS-enabled node pools have the following limitations:
- FIPS-enabled node pools require Kubernetes version 1.19 and greater.
- To update the underlying packages or modules used for FIPS, you must use
[Node Image Upgrade](node-image-upgrade). - Container images on the FIPS nodes aren't assessed for FIPS compliance.
- Mounting of a CIFS share fails because FIPS disables some authentication modules. To work around this issue, see
[Errors when mounting a file share on a FIPS-enabled node pool](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share#fipsnodepool). - FIPS-enabled node pools with
[Arm64 VMs](use-arm64-vms)are only supported with Azure Linux 3.0+. - FIPS isn't supported with
[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).


Important

The FIPS-enabled Linux image is a different image than the default Linux image used for Linux-based node pools.

FIPS-enabled node images can have different version numbers, such as kernel version, than images that aren't FIPS-enabled. The update cycle for FIPS-enabled node pools and node images can differ from node pools and images that aren't FIPS-enabled.

## Supported OS Versions

You can create FIPS-enabled node pools on all supported OS types (Linux and Windows). However, not all OS versions support FIPS-enabled node pools. After a new OS version is released, there's typically a waiting period before it's FIPS compliant.

This table includes the supported OS versions:

| OS Type | OS SKU | FIPS Compliance |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | Supported |
| Linux | Azure Linux | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2019 | Supported |
| Windows | Windows Server 2022 | Supported |

When requesting FIPS enabled Ubuntu, if the default Ubuntu version doesn't support FIPS, AKS defaults to the most recent FIPS-supported version of Ubuntu. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Linux node pools. Since 22.04 doesn't currently support FIPS, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 20.04 for Linux FIPS-enabled node pools.

Note

Previously, you could use the GetOSOptions API to determine whether a given OS supported FIPS. The GetOSOptions API is now deprecated and it will no longer be included in new AKS API versions starting with 2024-05-01.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image`

Note

You can also use the

`--enable-fips-image`

parameter with the[az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)command when creating a cluster to enable FIPS on the default node pool. When adding node pools to a cluster created in this way, you still must use the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter when adding node pools to create a FIPS-enabled node pool.Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows the

*fipsnp*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ fipsnp True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-fipsnp`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-fipsnp-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool

Create a FIPS-enabled Windows node pool using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter. Unlike Linux-based node pools, Windows node pools share the same image set.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name fipsnp \ --enable-fips-image \ --os-type Windows`

Verify your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

Verify Windows node pools have access to the FIPS cryptographic libraries by

[creating an RDP connection to a Windows node](rdp)in a FIPS-enabled node pool and check the registry. From the**Run**application, enter`regedit`

.Look for

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy`

in the registry.If

`Enabled`

is set to*1*, then FIPS is enabled.FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Update an existing node pool to enable or disable FIPS

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable or disable FIPS. If you're planning to migrate your node pools from non-FIPS to FIPS, first validate that your application is working properly in a test environment before migrating it to a production environment. Validating your application in a test environment should prevent issues caused by the FIPS kernel blocking some weak cipher or encryption algorithm, such as an MD4 algorithm that isn't FIPS compliant.

Note

When updating an existing Linux node pool to enable or disable FIPS, the node pool update moves between the fips and non-fips image. This node pool update triggers a reimage to complete the update. This can cause the node pool update to take a few minutes to complete.

### Prerequisites

Azure CLI version 2.64.0 or later. To find the version, run `az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Enable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to enable FIPS. When you update an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current image to the recommended FIPS image of the same OS SKU.

Update a node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--enable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --enable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool is FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool is FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np True nodepool1 False`

List the nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the nodes in the cluster. The nodes starting with

`aks-np`

are part of the FIPS-enabled node pool.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 6m4s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000001 Ready agent 5m21s v1.19.9 aks-np-12345678-vmss000002 Ready agent 6m8s v1.19.9 aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 Ready agent 34m v1.19.9`

Run a deployment with an interactive session on one of the nodes in the FIPS-enabled node pool using the

`kubectl debug`

command.`kubectl debug node/aks-np-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

From the interactive session output, verify the FIPS cryptographic libraries are enabled. Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`root@aks-np-12345678-vmss000000:/# cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled 1`

FIPS-enabled node pools also have a

*kubernetes.azure.com/fips_enabled=true*label, which deployments can use to target those node pools.

## Disable FIPS on an existing node pool

Existing Linux node pools can be updated to disable FIPS. When updating an existing node pool, the node image changes from the current FIPS image to the recommended non-FIPS image of the same OS SKU. The node image change will occur after a reimage.

Update a Linux node pool using the

[az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update)command with the`--disable-fips-image`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name np \ --disable-fips-image`

This command triggers a reimage of the node pool immediately to deploy the FIPS compliant Operating System. This reimage occurs during the node pool update. No extra steps are required.

Verify that your node pool isn't FIPS-enabled using the

[az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)command and query for the*enableFIPS*value in*agentPoolProfiles*.`az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query="agentPoolProfiles[].{Name:name enableFips:enableFips}" \ -o table`

The following example output shows that the

*np*node pool isn't FIPS-enabled:`Name enableFips --------- ------------ np False nodepool1 False`


## Message of the Day

Pass the `--message-of-the-day`

flag with the location of the file to replace the Message of the Day on Linux nodes at cluster creation or node pool creation.

Create a cluster with message of the day using the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command.

```
az aks create --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --message-of-the-day ./newMOTD.txt
```


Add a node pool with message of the day using the [az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command.

```
az aks nodepool add --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --message-of-the-day ./newMOTD.txt
```
