Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy an application that uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI on AKS. With OpenAI, you can easily adapt different AI models, such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code generation, for your specific tasks. You start by deploying an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Then, you deploy your OpenAI service and the sample application.

The sample cloud native application is representative of real-world implementations. The multi-container application is comprised of applications written in multiple languages and frameworks, including:

- Golang with Gin
- Rust with Actix-Web
- JavaScript with Vue.js and Fastify
- Python with FastAPI

These applications provide front ends for customers and store admins, REST APIs for sending data to RabbitMQ message queue and MongoDB database, and console apps to simulate traffic.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

To access the GitHub codebase for the sample application, see [AKS Store Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - For this demo, you can either use Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI service.
- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the
[Request access to Azure OpenAI Service form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). - If you plan on using OpenAI, sign up on the
[OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is a logical group in which you deploy and manage Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

The following example output shows successful creation of the resource group:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup", "location": "eastus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroup", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup*.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`

Note

If your Linux-based system requires elevated permissions, you can use the

`sudo az aks install-cli`

command.Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

This command executes the following operations:

- Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
- Uses
`~/.kube/config`

, the default location for the[Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using*--file*argument.

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is

*Ready*.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6`


Note

For private clusters, the nodes might be unreachable if you try to connect to them through the public IP address. In order to fix this, you need to create an endpoint within the same VNET as the cluster to connect from. Follow the instructions to [Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters) and then connect to it.

## Deploy the application

The [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Makeline service**: Processes orders from the queue and completes the orders.**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Store admin**: Web application for store employees to view orders in the queue and manage product information.**Virtual customer**: Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis.**Virtual worker**: Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis.**Mongo DB**: NoSQL instance for persisted data.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

Review the

[YAML manifest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml)for the application.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/mongodb created service/mongodb created deployment.apps/rabbitmq created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/makeline-service created service/makeline-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created deployment.apps/store-admin created service/store-admin created deployment.apps/virtual-customer created deployment.apps/virtual-worker created`


## Deploy OpenAI

You can either use Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and run your application on AKS.

- In the Azure portal, create an Azure OpenAI instance.
- Navigate to the Azure OpenAI instance you created.
- From the
**Overview**blade, navigate to the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). - Create a new
**Chat**deployment using the**gpt-4o-mini**base model.

For more information on how to create a deployment in Azure OpenAI, see [Get started generating text using Azure OpenAI Service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Deploy the AI service

Now that the application is deployed, you can deploy the Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to automatically generate descriptions for new products being added to the store's catalog.

Create a file named

`ai-service.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "" - name: OPENAI_API_KEY value: "" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ai-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 5001 targetPort: 5001 selector: app: ai-service`

Set the environment variable

`USE_AZURE_OPENAI`

to`"True"`

.Get your Azure OpenAI deployment name from

[Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/portal/)and fill in the`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

value.Get your Azure OpenAI endpoint and Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure portal by selecting

**Keys and Endpoint**in the left blade of the resource. Update the`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

and`OPENAI_API_KEY`

in the YAML accordingly.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ai-service.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/ai-service created service/ai-service created`


Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use [Managed Identity](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity#authorize-access-to-managed-identities) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI service instead or store your secrets in [Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).

## Test the application

Check the status of the deployed pods using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods`

Make sure all the pods are

*Running*before continuing to the next step.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE makeline-service-7db94dc7d4-8g28l 1/1 Running 0 99s mongodb-78f6d95f8-nptbz 1/1 Running 0 99s order-service-55cbd784bb-6bmfb 1/1 Running 0 99s product-service-6bf4d65f74-7cbvk 1/1 Running 0 99s rabbitmq-9855984f9-94nlm 1/1 Running 0 99s store-admin-7f7d768c48-9hn8l 1/1 Running 0 99s store-front-6786c64d97-xq5s9 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-customer-79498f8667-xzsb7 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-worker-6d77fff4b5-7g7rj 1/1 Running 0 99s`

Get the IP of the store admin web application and store front web application using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-admin`

The application exposes the Store Admin site to the internet via a public load balancer provisioned by the Kubernetes service. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

**EXTERNAL IP**initially shows*pending*until the service comes up and shows the IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE store-admin LoadBalancer 10.0.142.228 40.64.86.161 80:32494/TCP 50m`

Repeat the same step for the service named `store-front``.

Open a web browser and browse to the external IP address of your service. In the example shown here, open

*40.64.86.161*to see Store Admin in the browser. Repeat the same step for Store Front.In store admin, select the products tab, then select

**Add Products**.When the `ai-service`` is running successfully, you should see the Ask OpenAI button next to the description field. Fill in the name, price, and keywords, then generate a product description by selecting

**Ask OpenAI**>**Save product**.You can now see the new product you created on Store Admin used by sellers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added.

You can also see the new product you created on Store Front used by buyers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added. Remember to get the IP address of store front using the

command.`kubectl get service`

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

CLI installed and updated. Install it locally using the`az aks install-cli`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

# Scale node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As your application workload demands change, you might need to scale the number of nodes in a node pool in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this article, you learn how to manually and automatically scale node pools in AKS.

## Prerequisites for AKS node pool scaling

- An existing AKS cluster with at least one node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with node pools](create-node-pools). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.2.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Scale a node pool manually

Scale the number of nodes in a node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool scale`

][az-aks-nodepool-scale] command. The`--node-count`

flag specifies the desired number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the node pool is scaled to five nodes.`az aks nodepool scale \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --node-count 5 \ --no-wait`

Check the status of your node pools using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name>`

The following example output shows the node pool is in the

*Scaling*state with a new count of five nodes:`[ { ... "count": 5, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Scaling", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... }, { ... "count": 2, ... "name": "<node-pool-name-2>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Succeeded", ... "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2", ... } ]`

It takes a few minutes for the scale operation to complete. After the scale operation is complete, the node pool's

`provisioningState`

changes to*Succeeded*.

## Scale a node pool automatically with the cluster autoscaler

You can use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) with multiple node pools, and you can enable it on individual node pools and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing node pool using the [

`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

flag. The`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

flags specify the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the node pool. In this example, the cluster autoscaler is enabled with a minimum count of one node and a maximum count of five nodes:`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

If you want to disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool, use the [`az aks nodepool update`

][az-aks-nodepool-update] command with the `--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

flag instead of `--update-cluster-autoscaler`

.

## Next steps: Manage node pools in AKS

# Start and stop an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pool

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You might not need to continuously run your AKS workloads. For example, you might have a development cluster that has node pools running specific workloads. To optimize your compute costs, you can completely stop your node pools in your AKS cluster.

## Features and limitations

- You can't stop system pools.
- Spot node pools are supported.
- Stopped node pools can be upgraded.
- The cluster and node pool must be running.
- You can't stop node pools from clusters which use the
[Node Autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision)feature.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to stop and start your node pools in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#start-and-stop-node-pools).

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one using the [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

## Stop an AKS node pool

Stop a running AKS node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool stop`

`az aks nodepool stop --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

Verify your node pool stopped using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

The following condensed example output shows the

`powerState`

as`Stopped`

:`{ [...] "osType": "Linux", "podSubnetId": null, "powerState": { "code": "Stopped" }, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "proximityPlacementGroupId": null, [...] }`

Note

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Stopping`

, your node pool is still in the process of stopping.Note

Stopping the node pool will stop its Cluster Autoscaler, and starts it back when starting the node pool. So if you manually modify the number of VMSS instances in the pool while it's stopped, Cluster Autoscaler might show inconsistencies.


## Start a stopped AKS node pool

Restart a stopped node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool start`

`az aks nodepool start --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

Verify your node pool started using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --nodepool-name testnodepool`

The following condensed example output shows the

`powerState`

as`Running`

:`{ [...] "osType": "Linux", "podSubnetId": null, "powerState": { "code": "Running" }, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "proximityPlacementGroupId": null, [...] }`

Note

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Starting`

, your node pool is still in the process of starting.

# Upgrade Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article addresses upgrade experiences for Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To learn more about the release schedule and support for service mesh add-on revisions, read the [support policy](istio-support-policy#versioning-and-support-policy).

## Minor revision upgrade

Istio add-on allows upgrading the minor revision using [canary upgrade process](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/). When an upgrade is initiated, the control plane of the new (canary) revision is deployed alongside the initial (stable) revision's control plane. You can then manually roll over data plane workloads while using monitoring tools to track the health of workloads during this process. If you don't observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can complete the upgrade so that only the new revision remains on the cluster. Else, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio.

Available upgrades depend on whether the current Istio revision and AKS cluster version are supported:

- You can upgrade to the
**next supported revision (**or skip one and upgrade to`n+1`

), as long as both are supported and compatible with the cluster version.`n+2`

- If both your current revision (
`n`

) and the next revision (`n+1`

) are unsupported, you can only upgrade to the**nearest supported revision (**, but not beyond it.`n+2`

or higher) - If the cluster version and Istio revision are both unsupported, the cluster version must be upgraded before an Istio upgrade can be initiated.

Note

Once an AKS version or mesh revision falls outside the support window, upgrading either version becomes error-prone. While such upgrades are **allowed** to recover to a supported version, **the upgrade process and the out-of-support versions themselves are both not supported by Microsoft**. We strongly recommend keeping AKS version and mesh revision up to date to avoid running into unsupported scenarios. Refer to the [Istio add-on support calendar](istio-support-policy#service-mesh-add-on-release-calendar) for estimated release and end-of-life dates and the [upstream Istio release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/) for the new revision for notable changes.

The following example illustrates how to upgrade from revision `asm-1-23`

to `asm-1-24`

with all workloads in the `default`

namespace. The steps are the same for all minor upgrades and may be used for any number of namespaces.

Use the

[az aks mesh get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-upgrades)command to check which revisions are available for the cluster as upgrade targets:`az aks mesh get-upgrades --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

If you expect to see a newer revision not returned by this command, you may need to upgrade your AKS cluster first so that it's compatible with the newest revision.

If you set up

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)for the existing mesh revision on your cluster, you need to create a separate ConfigMap corresponding to the new revision in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace**before initiating the canary upgrade**in the next step. This configuration is applicable the moment the new revision's control plane is deployed on cluster. More details can be found[here](istio-meshconfig#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades).Initiate a canary upgrade from revision

`asm-1-23`

to`asm-1-24`

using[az aks mesh upgrade start](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh/upgrade#az-aks-mesh-upgrade-start):`az aks mesh upgrade start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --revision asm-1-24`

A canary upgrade means the 1.24 control plane is deployed alongside the 1.23 control plane. They continue to coexist until you either complete or roll back the upgrade.

While a canary upgrade is in progress, the higher revision is considered the

*default revision*used for validation of Istio resources.Optionally, revision tags may be used to roll over the data plane to the new revision without needing to manually relabel each namespace. Manually relabeling namespaces when moving them to a new revision can be tedious and error-prone.

[Revision tags](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/#stable-revision-labels)solve this problem by serving as stable identifiers that point to revisions.Rather than relabeling each namespace, a cluster operator can change the tag to point to a new revision. All namespaces labeled with that tag are updated at the same time. However, you still need to restart the workloads to make sure the correct version of

`istio-proxy`

sidecars are injected.To use revision tags during an upgrade:

Create a revision tag for the initial revision. In this example, we name it

`prod-stable`

:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Create a revision tag for the revision installed during the upgrade. In this example, we name it

`prod-canary`

:`istioctl tag set prod-canary --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Label application namespaces to map to revision tags:

`# label default namespace to map to asm-1-23 kubectl label ns default istio.io/rev=prod-stable --overwrite`

You may also label namespaces with

`istio.io/rev=prod-canary`

for the newer revision. However, the workloads in those namespaces aren't updated to a new sidecar until they're restarted.If a new application is created in a namespace after it is labeled, a sidecar will be injected corresponding to the revision tag on that namespace.


Verify control plane pods corresponding to both

`asm-1-23`

and`asm-1-24`

exist:Verify

`istiod`

pods:`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-system`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-dbzlt 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-fg8zh 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-7rwg4 1/1 Running 0 51m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-8p9qx 1/1 Running 0 51m`

If ingress is enabled, verify ingress pods:

`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-qkvq2 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-vhtd5 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-ft9c8 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-wcb6s 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-4cc2l 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-jjc7m 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-g89s4 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-krq9w 1/1 Running 0 51m`

Observe that ingress gateway pods of both revisions are deployed side-by-side. However, the service and its IP remain immutable.


Relabel the namespace so that any new pods are mapped to the Istio sidecar associated with the new revision and its control plane:

If using revision tags, overwrite the

`prod-stable`

tag itself to change its mapping:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Verify the tag-to-revision mappings:

`istioctl tag list`

Both tags should point to the newly installed revision:

`TAG REVISION NAMESPACES prod-canary asm-1-24 default prod-stable asm-1-24 ...`

In this case, you don't need to relabel each namespace individually.

If not using revision tags, data plane namespaces must be relabeled to point to the new revision:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-24 --overwrite`


Relabeling doesn't affect your workloads until they're restarted.

Individually roll over each of your application workloads by restarting them. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Check your monitoring tools and dashboards to determine whether your workloads are all running in a healthy state after the restart. Based on the outcome, you have two options:

**Complete the canary upgrade**: If you're satisfied that the workloads are all running in a healthy state as expected, you can complete the canary upgrade. Completion of the upgrade removes the previous revision's control plane and leaves behind the new revision's control plane on the cluster. Run the following command to complete the canary upgrade:`az aks mesh upgrade complete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

**Rollback the canary upgrade**: In case you observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio:

Relabel the namespace to the previous revision: If using revision tags:

`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Or, if not using revision tags:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-23 --overwrite`

Roll back the workloads to use the sidecar corresponding to the previous Istio revision by restarting these workloads again:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Roll back the control plane to the previous revision:

`az aks mesh upgrade rollback --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`


The

`prod-canary`

revision tag can be removed:`istioctl tag remove prod-canary --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

If

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)was previously set up for the revisions, you can now delete the ConfigMap for the revision that was removed from the cluster during complete/rollback.

### Minor revision upgrades with ingress and egress gateways

If you're currently using [Istio ingress gateways](istio-deploy-ingress) or [egress gateways](istio-deploy-egress) and are performing a minor revision upgrade, keep in mind that Istio ingress and egress gateway pods / deployments are deployed per-revision, but the service is shared across both revisions.

We provide a single `LoadBalancer`

service across all ingress gateway pods over multiple revisions, so the external/internal IP address of the ingress gateways remains unchanged throughout the course of an upgrade. Thus, during the canary upgrade, when two revisions exist simultaneously on the cluster, the ingress gateway pods of both revisions serve incoming traffic.

Likewise, during a canary upgrade, all pods for an egress gateway across both revisions will be served by a single `ClusterIP`

service.

### Minor revision upgrades with horizontal pod autoscaling customizations

If you have customized [horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) settings for Istiod or the ingress gateways](istio-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaling-customization), note the following behavior for how HPA settings are applied across both revisions to maintain consistency during a canary upgrade:

- If you update the HPA spec before initiating an upgrade, the settings from the existing (stable) revision will be applied to the HPAs of the canary revision when the new control plane is installed.
- If you update the HPA spec while a canary upgrade is in progress, the HPA spec of the stable revision will take precedence and be applied to the HPA of the canary revision.
- If you update the HPA of the stable revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be updated to reflect the new settings applied to the stable revision.
- If you update the HPA of the canary revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be reverted to the HPA spec of the stable revision.


## Patch version upgrade

- Istio add-on patch version availability information is published in
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - Patches are rolled out automatically for istiod and ingress pods as part of these AKS releases, which respect the
`default`

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)set up for the cluster. - User needs to initiate patches to Istio proxy in their workloads by restarting the pods for reinjection:
Check the version of the Istio proxy intended for new or restarted pods. This version is the same as the version of the istiod and Istio ingress pods after they were patched:

`kubectl get cm -n aks-istio-system -o yaml | grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless", "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless"`

Check the Istio proxy image version for all pods in a namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.23.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless`

To trigger reinjection, restart the workloads. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployments/productpage-v1 -n default`

To verify that they're now on the newer versions, check the Istio proxy image version again for all pods in the namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.2.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.24.0-distroless`

# Automated deployments for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Automated Deployments streamline the process of setting up a GitHub Action or Azure DevOps Pipeline, making it easy to create a continuous deployment pipeline for your application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Once connected, every new commit automatically triggers the pipeline, delivering updates to your application seamlessly. You can either bring your own deployment files for quick pipeline creation or generate Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests to containerize and deploy non-containerized applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account or an Azure DevOps organization.
- An AKS cluster. If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - An Azure Container Registry (ACR). If you don't have one, you can create one using the steps in
[Integrate Azure Container Registry (ACR) with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](cluster-container-registry-integration). - An application to deploy.

### Connect to source code repository

Create an automated deployment workflow and authorize it to connect to the desired source code repository.

- In the Azure portal, navigate to your AKS cluster resource.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Automated deployments**>**Create**. - Under
**Repository details**, enter a name for the workflow, then select**GitHub or ADO**for your repository location. - Select
**Authorize access**to connect to the desired repository. - Choose the
**Repository**and**Branch**, and then select**Next**.

### Choose the container image configuration

To get an application ready for Kubernetes, you need to build it into a container image and store it in a container registry. You use a Dockerfile to provide instructions on how to build the container image. If your source code repository doesn't already have a Dockerfile, Automated Deployments can generate one for you. Otherwise, you can use an existing Dockerfile.

Use Automated Deployments to generate a Dockerfile for many languages and frameworks such as Go, C#, Node.js, Python, Java, Gradle, Clojure, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Swift, and Rust. The language support is built on what's available in [draft.sh](https://draft.sh).

- Select
**Auto-containerize (generate Dockerfile)**for the container configuration. - Select the
**location of where to save the generated Dockerfile**in the repository. - Select the
**application environment**from the list of supported languages and frameworks. - Enter the
**application port**. - Provide the
**Dockerfile build context**path. - Select an existing
**Azure Container Registry**or create a new one. This registry is used to store the built application image.

### Choose the Kubernetes manifest configuration

Note

The Generate Manifests option also supports advanced features like Service Connector integration, auto-generated Ingress resources, and more detailed, customizable Kubernetes manifest files.

An application running on Kubernetes consists of many Kubernetes primitive components. These components describe what container image to use, how many replicas to run, if there's a public IP required to expose the application, etc. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation][kubernetes-documentation]. If your source code repository doesn't already have the basic Kubernetes manifests to deploy, Automated Deployments can generate them for you. Otherwise, you can use a set of existing manifests. You can also choose an existing Helm chart.

If your code repository already has a Dockerfile, you can select it to be used to build the application image.

- Select
**Use existing Kubernetes manifest deployment files**for the deployment options. - Select the
**Kubernetes manifest file or folder**from your repository. - Select
**Next**.

## (Optional) Use a managed ingress and/or Service Connector

When generating Kubernetes manifests with Automated Deployments, you can optionally enable App Routing to set up an ingress controller for your application. You can also use Service Connector to create a new connection or seamlessly integrate your app with an existing Azure service backend.

App Routing provides a fully managed NGINX-based ingress controller out of the box, complete with built-in SSL/TLS encryption using certificates stored in Azure Key Vault and DNS zone management through Azure DNS. When using Automated Deployments, the expose ingress command integrates seamlessly with App Routing, making it easy to expose your application to external traffic under a secure, custom DNS name—with minimal configuration.

- Select the
**Expose ingress**box. - Choose between an
**Existing ingress controller**or a**New ingress controller**. - Choose between using a
**SSL/TLS enabled**or**Insecure**ingress controller. - (Optional) Enter
**Certificate details**if choosing a**SSL/TLS enabled**ingress controller. - Choose between using
**Azure DNS**or a**3rd party provider**. - Enter the
**Azure DNS Zone**and**Subdomain name**.

## (Optional) Add environment variables

Define environment variables for a container in Kubernetes by specifying name-value pairs. Environment variables are important as they help enable easier management of settings, secure handling of sensitive information, and flexibility across environments.

## Review configuration and deploy

Review the configuration for the application, and Kubernetes manifests, then select **Deploy**. A pull request (PR) will be generated against the repository that you selected, so don't navigate away from deployment page.

### Review and merge pull request

When the deployment succeeds, select **View pull request** to view the details of the generated pull request on your code repository.

- Review the changes under
**Files changed**and make any desired edits. - Select
**Merge pull request**to merge the changes into your code repository.

Merging the change runs the GitHub Actions workflow that builds your application into a container image, stores it in Azure Container Registry, and deploys it to the cluster.

### Check the deployed resources

After the pipeline is completed, you can review the created Kubernetes `Service`

in the Azure portal by selecting **Services and ingresses** under the **Kubernetes resources** section of the service menu.

Selecting the **External IP** should open up a new browser page with the running application.

## Delete resources

Once you're done with your cluster, use the following steps to delete it to avoid incurring Azure charges:

- In the Azure portal, navigate to
**Automated deployments** - Select
**...**on the pipeline of your choice. - Select
**Delete**.

# Add Azure Dedicated Host to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Dedicated Host is a service that provides physical servers - able to host one or more virtual machines - dedicated to one Azure subscription. Dedicated hosts are the same physical servers used in our data centers, provided as a resource. You can provision dedicated hosts within a region, availability zone, and fault domain. Then, you can place VMs directly into your provisioned hosts, in whatever configuration best meets your needs.

Using Azure Dedicated Hosts for nodes with your AKS cluster has the following benefits:

- Hardware isolation at the physical server level. No other VMs will be placed on your hosts. Dedicated hosts are deployed in the same data centers and share the same network and underlying storage infrastructure as other, non-isolated hosts.
- Control over maintenance events initiated by the Azure platform. While most maintenance events have little to no impact on your virtual machines, there are some sensitive workloads where each second of pause can have an impact. With dedicated hosts, you can opt in to a maintenance window to reduce the impact to your service.

## Before you begin

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Before you start, ensure that your version of the Azure CLI is 2.39.0 or later. If it's an earlier version,
[install the latest version](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you integrate Azure Dedicated Host with Azure Kubernetes Service:

- Accelerated Networking
- An existing agent pool can't be converted from non-ADH to ADH or ADH to non-ADH.
- It isn't supported to update agent pool from host group A to host group B.
- Using ADH across subscriptions.

## Planning for ADH Capacity on AKS

Not all host SKUs are available in all regions, and availability zones. You can list host availability, and any offer restrictions before you start provisioning dedicated hosts.

```
az vm list-skus --location eastus --resource-type hostGroups/hosts -o table
```


Note

First, when using host group, the nodepool fault domain count is always the same as the host group fault domain count. In order to use cluster auto-scaling to work with ADH and AKS, please make sure your host group fault domain count and capacity is enough. Secondly, only change fault domain count from the default of 1 to any other number if you know what they are doing as a misconfiguration could lead to a unscalable configuration.

[Determine how many hosts you would need based on the expected VM Utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-host-general-purpose-skus).

Evaluate [host utilization](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts-how-to#check-the-status-of-the-host) to determine the number of allocatable VMs by size before you deploy.

```
az vm host get-instance-view --resource-group myDHResourceGroup --host-group MyHostGroup --name MyHost
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Group to an AKS cluster

A host group is a resource that represents a collection of dedicated hosts. You create a host group in a region and an availability zone, and add hosts to it. When planning for high availability, there are more options. You can use one or both of the following options with your dedicated hosts:

- Span across multiple availability zones. In this case, you're required to have a host group in each of the zones you wish to use.
- Span across multiple fault domains, which are mapped to physical racks.

In either case, you need to provide the fault domain count for your host group. If you don't want to span fault domains in your group, use a fault domain count of 1.

You can also decide to use both availability zones and fault domains.

## Create a Host Group

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

For more information about the host SKUs and pricing, see [Azure Dedicated Host pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/).

Use az vm host create to create a host. If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll be asked to specify the fault domain for your host.

In this example, we'll use [az vm host group create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm/host/group#az-vm-host-group-create) to create a host group using both availability zones and fault domains.

```
az vm host group create \
--name myHostGroup \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup \
--zone 1 \
--platform-fault-domain-count 1 \
--automatic-placement true
```


## Create a Dedicated Host

Now create a dedicated host in the host group. In addition to a name for the host, you're required to provide the SKU for the host. Host SKU captures the supported VM series and the hardware generation for your dedicated host.

If you set a fault domain count for your host group, you'll need to specify the fault domain for your host.

```
az vm host create \
--host-group myHostGroup \
--name myHost \
--sku DSv3-Type1 \
--platform-fault-domain 1 \
--resource-group myDHResourceGroup
```


## Use a user-assigned Identity

Important

A user-assigned Identity with "contributor" role on the Resource Group of the Host Group is required.

First, create a Managed Identity

```
az identity create --resource-group <Resource Group> --name <Managed Identity name>
```


Assign Managed Identity

```
az role assignment create --assignee <id> --role "Contributor" --scope <Resource id>
```


## Create an AKS cluster using the Host Group

Create an AKS cluster, and add the Host Group you just configured.

```
az aks create \
--resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--name MyManagedCluster \
--location eastus \
--nodepool-name agentpool1 \
--node-count 1 \
--host-group-id <id> \
--node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3 \
--assign-identity <id> \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Add a Dedicated Host Node Pool to an existing AKS cluster

Add a Host Group to an already existing AKS cluster.

```
az aks nodepool add --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup --node-count 1 --host-group-id <id> --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3
```


## Remove a Dedicated Host Node Pool from an AKS cluster

```
az aks nodepool delete --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --name agentpool3 --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create an AKS cluster with a Dedicated host, and to add a dedicated host to an existing cluster. For more information about Dedicated Hosts, see [dedicated-hosts](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts).

# Set up the Azure Kubernetes Service communication manager

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) communication manager streamlines notifications for all your AKS maintenance tasks by using Azure Resource Notifications and Azure Resource Graph frameworks. The communication manager gives you timely alerts on event triggers and outcomes, so that you can closely monitor your upgrades.

If maintenance fails, the communication manager notifies you with the reasons for the failure. This information reduces operational hassles related to observability and follow-ups.

By following the steps in this article, you can set up notifications for all types of automatic upgrades that use maintenance windows.

## Prerequisites

Configure your cluster for either the

[automatic upgrade channel](auto-upgrade-cluster)or the[automatic upgrade channel for nodes](auto-upgrade-node-os-image).Create a

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)for your configuration of automatic upgrades.

## Set up the communication manager

In the Azure portal, go to the resource.

Select

**Monitoring**>**Alerts**>**Alert Rules**, and then select**Create**.On the

**Condition**tab, for**Signal name**, select**Custom log search**.In the

**Search query**box, paste one of the following custom queries. Be sure to update the`where id contains`

path to reference your resources for subscription ID, resource group name, and cluster name.The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for clusters:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "K8sVersionUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

The following query is for notifications of automatic upgrades for NodeOS:

`arg("").containerserviceeventresources | where type == "microsoft.containerservice/managedclusters/scheduledevents" | where id contains "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourcegroups/<rgname>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<clustername>" | where properties has "eventStatus" | extend status = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "eventStatus") + strlen("eventStatus") + 3, 50) | extend status = substring(status, 0, indexof(status, ",") - 1) | where status != "" | where properties has "eventDetails" | extend upgradeType = case( properties has "K8sVersionUpgrade", "K8sVersionUpgrade", properties has "NodeOSUpgrade", "NodeOSUpgrade", "" ) | extend details = parse_json(tostring(properties.eventDetails)) | where properties has "lastUpdateTime" | extend eventTime = substring(properties, indexof(properties, "lastUpdateTime") + strlen("lastUpdateTime") + 3, 50) | extend eventTime = substring(eventTime, 0, indexof(eventTime, ",") - 1) | extend eventTime = todatetime(tostring(eventTime)) | where eventTime >= ago(30m) // Ensure this matches aggregation granularity & frequency | where upgradeType == "NodeOSUpgrade" | project eventTime, upgradeType, status, properties, name, details | order by eventTime asc`

Go to the

**Condition**tab. Configure the alert conditions with the following settings:**Measure**: Select**Table rows**.**Aggregation type**: Select**Count**.**Aggregation granularity**: Select**30 minutes**.**Threshold value**: Keep at**0**.**Split by dimensions**: For**Dimension name**, select**status**. Then select the**Include all future values**checkbox.

In the

**Split by dimensions**area, for**Dimension values**, select a value. Because you selected**status**for the dimension name, the available values are**Scheduled**,**Started**,**Completed**,**Canceled**, and**Failed**.Note

These status values appear only if your cluster previously executed automatic upgrade operations. For new clusters or for clusters that haven't undergone automatic upgrades yet, the dropdown list might appear empty or show no available dimensions. After your cluster performs its first automatic upgrade, these status values become available for selection.

Go to the

**Actions**tab. Make sure that an action group with the correct email address exists, so that you can receive the notifications:Select

**Use action groups**>**Create an action group**.For

**Notification type**, select**Email/SMS_message/Push/Voice**.Select the

**Email**checkbox, and then enter the email address in the**Email**box.

Go to the

**Details**tab. Assign a managed identity so that you can grant access to the necessary resources. In the**Identity**area, select**System assigned managed identity**.Go to the

**Review + create**tab, and then select**Create**.Now that you've created the alert rule, you can assign the appropriate roles for the managed identity:

- In the alert rule, go to
**Settings**>**Identity**>**System assigned managed identity**>**Azure role assignments**. - Select
**Add role assignment**, select the**Reader**role, and assign it to the resource group. - Select

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Network policies are essential for securing Kubernetes clusters by defining and controlling pod communication. They mitigate unauthorized access and potential security breaches by regulating traffic flow. Advanced Container Networking Services strengthens security with [FQDN-based network policies](container-network-security-fqdn-filtering-concepts). Expanding on this foundation, Advanced Container Networking Services now provides L7 policy support, enabling detailed inspection and management of application-level traffic. This advancement enhances both the security and efficiency of network communications within AKS clusters. The offering includes comprehensive support for widely adopted protocols, including HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka.

## Components of L7 policy

**Envoy proxy**: Envoy, part of ACNS security agent acts as the enforcement point for L7 policies. A TPROXY inspects application traffic, comparing it against the defined L7 policies. To enhance scalability and resource management, Envoy is deployed as a separate DaemonSet, decoupled from the Cilium Agent.

## How L7 policy works

When L7 policy enforcement is enabled for an application or pod, outgoing network traffic is first evaluated to determine compliance with the configured application-level rules. The eBPF probe attached to the source pod’s network interface marks the packets, which are then redirected to a node-local Envoy Proxy. This redirection occurs only for pods enforcing L7 policies, ensuring that policy enforcement is applied selectively.

The Envoy proxy, augmented with Cilium network filters, then decides whether to forward the traffic to the destination pod based on policy criteria. If permitted, the traffic proceeds; if not, Envoy returns an appropriate error code to the originating pod. Upon successful authorization, the Envoy proxy facilitates the traffic flow, providing application-level visibility and control. This allows the Cilium agent to enforce detailed network policies within the policy engine. The following diagram illustrates the high-level flow of L7 policy enforcement.

## Monitoring L7 traffic with Hubble and Grafana

To gain insights into L7 traffic flows, specifically HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka, Azure CNI Powered by Cilium leverages Hubble agent, which is enabled by default with Advanced Container Networking Services. Hubble provides detailed flow-level metrics.

To simplify the analysis of these L7 metrics, we provide pre-configured Azure Managed Grafana dashboards. You can find them under the **Dashboards > Azure Managed Prometheus** folder, with filenames like **"Kubernetes/Networking/L7 (Namespace)"** and **"Kubernetes/Networking/L7 (Workload)"**.

These dashboards offer granular visibility into L7 flow data at the cluster, namespace, and workload levels.

Note

These dashboards will only display data if you have this feature enabled on your cluster and have relevant policies applied.
Additionally, the monitoring metrics are **not** required to flow through Envoy, a component of the ACNS security agent. Rather, these metrics are collected by the Hubble agent, which is installed on your cluster as part of the Advanced Container Networking Service's observability feature.

## Key benefits

**Granular Application-Level Control**: L7 policies allow for fine-grained control over network traffic based on application-specific attributes, such as HTTP methods, gRPC paths, and Kafka topics. This extends beyond the basic IP address and port-based control of traditional network policies.

**Enhanced Security**: By inspecting application-level traffic, L7 policies can prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities at the application layer. This includes blocking unauthorized access to specific APIs or services. Furthermore, L7 policies are an important component of a Zero Trust security strategy, enabling the enforcement of the principle of least privilege at the application layer.

**Graceful Error Handling**: Unlike L3/L4 policies that typically drop unauthorized traffic silently, L7 policies can return application-level error codes (for example, HTTP 403, Kafka authorization failures), allowing applications to handle errors more gracefully.

**Observability**: With observability enabled for Advanced Container Networking Services and L7 policies applied to your AKS cluster, you can monitor traffic and policy effectiveness using Grafana dashboards.

## Limitations and considerations

- Current feature support relies on Cilium's Layer 7 policy enforcement based on HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, and Kafka.
- The maximum supported cluster size is up to 1,000 nodes or 40,000 pods, whichever is greater.
- Traffic traversing Envoy proxies do come with latency. Users may experience noticeable latency degradation beyond 3,000 requests per second.
- As part of our observability solution, we provide envoy_http_rq_total metrics. These metrics give the total request count, which could be used to derive requests per seconds (rps).
- During a Cilium upgrade or rollout, existing sessions can be gracefully closed. Applications are expected to handle these interruptions gracefully—typically by implementing retry mechanisms at the connection or request level. New connections initiated during the rollout aren't impacted.
- L7 policy isn't supported by CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy(CCNP).
- L7 policy through Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) isn't compatible with L7 policies implemented via alternate methods such as Istio. The following table summarizes the supported scenarios.

| Feature/Component | L7 Policies using AKS, Istio - Managed addon |
|---|---|
| K8s network policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium | Supported |
| L4 (FQDN) Policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium and ACNS | Supported |
| L7 (HTTP(s)/GRPC/Kafka) Policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium and ACNS | Not Supported |

# Pod Sandboxing considerations

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

For Pod Sandboxing deployments on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) there are several items to consider in regard to resource management, memory management, CPU management, and security.

## Resource management

Memory and CPU management behavior with Pod Sandboxing might be unfamiliar to some users. These considerations are relevant when specifying resources in a deployment, especially for larger and resource sensitive workloads.

### Kata components

In a Kata deployment, there are generally two families of components that get deployed. You have **host components** and **guest components**.

- The main
**host components**comprise of the*Kata shim*,*Cloud Hypervisor*, and*virtiofsd*.- The
*Kata shim*manages a pod VM lifecycle. *Cloud Hypervisor*is the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) used by the Kata shim.*virtiofsd*is a daemon used to share files between each Pod VM and its container host.

- The
- The main
**guest components**include the*user's workloads*,*pod VM kernel*, and the*Kata agent*.- The
*Kata agent*manages containers inside of the Pod VMs

- The

### Memory management

With Kata pods, you have the ability to specify the amount of memory of the Pod VM that hosts your workloads. It's crucial that you configure the values accordingly so that a pod has sufficient resources, but doesn't result in unused memory being allocated to the pod.

### Pod VM memory size

There's an amount of memory allocated to each pod VM that runs a container. This VM memory size is inclusive of all the memory necessary to run Kata guest components. Users should take care to ensure that they buffer some extra memory beyond the expected consumption of their workloads to account for the consumption of other guest components, such as the kata agent or VM kernel. Examples are given on typical memory values later on in this article.

The pod VM memory size is equivalent to the [Kubernetes pod memory limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-and-a-memory-limit) the user specifies. A user can change the value by changing their pod memory limit; if no values are specified, a default size of 512Mi is applied. Once the pod starts, this size becomes fixed.

As the pod VM memory size increases, the runtime class memory overhead should be expected to increase alongside it.

### Runtime class memory overhead

Pod Sandboxing workloads come with a default kata runtime class (`kata-vm-isolation`

) which comes with default overheads for resources. Users that want finer grain control of their resource quotas can [set up a custom runtime class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/#setup) with specific resource overheads. When doing so, users should ensure that the memory overhead value of the runtime class is enough that covers all expected usage for the **host components** of a kata deployment. The runtime class memory overhead does *not* need to account for the expected memory consumption of the **guest components**.

You can create a specialized runtime and specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RuntimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example), let's assume I want to create a runtime for workloads I expect to be smaller in consumption:

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: small-kata-pods
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
memory: "120Mi"
```


Specifying overheads isn't required, and suggested if you want finer control over the resources being set aside for your workloads. If you use the default `kata-vm-isolation`

runtime class and don't specify any overheads in your YAML, the overhead of the Pod VM size defaults to 512Mi and the runtime class overhead defaults to 600Mi. This default runtime overhead is calculated with the default pod VM size (512Mi) plus to approximate memory needed by host components for such a VM size (~88Mi).

### User workloads

When a user deploys a Kata workload, they're able to use memory up to the configured *pod VM memory size* minus the other guest components, such as the Kata agent or the guest VM kernel.

If you would like to get an approximation of the memory used by these components:

- Connect to the pod VM (either via
`kubectl exec`

or`kubectl debug`

to open a shell inside your pod). - Run the
`free`

command. - Inspect the "used" column in the output to get an idea of the memory consumed by the guest kernel/kata agent.

### Memory cgroups

When a Kata pod is scheduled to run, kubelet assigns the pod to a memory `cgroup`

. This `cgroup`

enforces the pod's memory limits/requests, allowing a user to define the resource quotas available to a pod.

Within the memory `cgroup`

, there are two important fields to consider:

`memory.current`

defines how many bytes of memory the host components and the pod VM memory size allocates.`memory.max`

optional, user defined upper limit of memory.current for pods where users want to impose a memory limit.- The kubelet computes this value as the sum of a pod's memory limit and its runtime class memory overhead.


At any point, if the `memory.current`

value exceeds that of `memory.max`

, [the kernel might trigger an OOMKill on the pod if memory pressure is detected](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits).

### Reference usage values

Users can utilize these values to serve as a reference for the typical memory usage and values across the different variables covered. Pod VM memory sizes under 128Mi aren't supported.

| Pod VM Memory Size | Runtime class overhead | memory.current | memory.max | Free memory available to Host components |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128Mi | 16Mi | 133Mi | 144Mi | 11Mi |
| 256Mi | 32Mi | 263Mi | 288Mi | 25Mi |
| 1Gi | 128Mi | 1034Mi | 1152Mi | 118Mi |
| 2Gi | 256Mi | 2063Mi | 2304Mi | 241Mi |
| 4Gi | 374Mi | 4122Mi | 4470Mi | 348Mi |
| 8Gi | 512Mi | 8232Mi | 8704Mi | 472Mi |
| 32Gi | 640Mi | 32918Mi | 33408Mi | 490Mi |
| 64Gi | 768Mi | 65825Mi | 66304Mi | 479Mi |
| 96Gi | 896Mi | 98738Mi | 99200Mi | 462Mi |
| 128Gi | 1Gi | 131646Mi | 132096Mi | 450Mi |

## CPU management

In a similar vein to memory, you can also allocate CPU resources to your Kata workloads. Doing so is recommended; without declaring a CPU limit for your Kata pod, Kata host components are able to use any CPU capacity available on the node.

### Reserving CPU

When reserving CPUs for your Kata workloads, you have two fields you can choose to set.

- The
*runtime class CPU overhead* - The
*pod CPU limit*

When at least one of the two values is specified, the control plane reserves the specified number of CPUs on the node for your workload. Other pods on the same node can't access this reserved capacity.

### Pod CPU limit

You can declare your [pod CPU limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/) in your application's manifest. A specified pod CPU limit defines the limit of the CPUs that containers in the associated pod VM can use.

If you specify fractions of CPUs for the pod CPU limit, those fractions will get rounded up to the next integer. The rounded up number becomes the number of vCPUs allocated to the Pod VM, but a `cgroup`

will limit the workload to only consume the fraction specified in the pod CPU limit.

If no number is declared, one vCPU will be allocated to the pod VM if the capacity is available on the node. There's no limit on the CPU consumption of the Kata host components.

### Runtime class CPU overhead

The runtime class overhead should be specified if you'd like to preemptively reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components.

You can specify the memory overhead in your runtime class through the `overhead`

field in your `RunTimeClass`

manifest. [As an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/#usage-example):

```
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
name: custom-kata-runtime
handler: kata
overhead:
podFixed:
cpu: "250m"
```


### Best practices

#### Memory management

- Ensure you specify pod VM memory sizes (defined by the
`limits.memory`

in your manifest) and suitable resource quotas for all your deployments.- Ensure you use a nonzero
*pod request*if you want to ensure that some node capacity is reserved for the pod VM before that VM starts up. The request should account for the pod VM and containers that are expected to run on it. - Ensure you use a nonzero
*runtime class overhead*if you want to reserve some node capacity for the Kata host components before those components start up.

- Ensure you use a nonzero
- If you expect your pod workloads to be especially resource hungry, you can specify limits accordingly for the pod VM to ensure that there are ample resources available for your workloads.
- Declare a suitable runtime class memory overhead such that it gives enough memory for your host components but doesn't take too much to avoid allocating unused memory.

#### CPU management

If your node typically has plenty of free CPU capacity, these reservations might be unnecessary.

If your nodes typically run to the limit with CPU consumption, then a nonzero reservation ensures your pods can be executed more reliably.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
*not*available to other workloads on the node.

- You can utilize pod CPU requests to ensure that some CPU node capacity is reserved for the Kata host components. Reserved capacity for a specific workload is
Make sure you specify CPU requests that your infrastructure can accommodate. If your available capacity runs near 0, or your request is too large, your workloads might

[fail to start](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-that-is-too-big-for-your-nodes)Align your CPU requests with your CPU limits. The Kata shim doesn't have visibility into requests. Therefore, if no CPU limit is declared, the pod VM is limited to one vCPU. The Kata host components, which do have visibility into request values, consumes the rest of the requested CPU count and have no limit to CPU consumption.

Reserved capacity for a specific workload is

*not*available to other workloads on the node.

### Example declarations

| Runtime class CPU overhead | Pod CPU Request/Limit | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | The control plane reserves two CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets one CPU, and containers on the pod can use up to the one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to two CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| 1 | 2.5 | The control plane reserves 3.5 CPUs on the node. The pod VM gets three vCPUs, but containers on the pod VM can use up to 2.5 vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and pod VM together can use up to 3.5 CPUs from the reserved capacity on the node. |
| None | 1 | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The Kata host components and the pod VM together are allowed to use up to one CPU from the reserved capacity on the node. One CPU is always available to the pod VM due to the CPU request. |
| 1 | None | The control plane reserves one CPU on the node. The pod VM gets one vCPU, and containers on the pod VM can use up to one vCPU capacity. The kata host components and the pod VM can use any CPU capacity available on the node. At least one CPU is always available due to the overhead reservation. |

## Security

Pod Sandboxing offers users a compelling option to isolate their workloads from other workloads and the host. There are, nonetheless, important security concerns that should be taken into account.

### Privileged pods

There are scenarios in which privileged pods might be required. Users are able to spin up privileged pods, but no [host devices are attached to the pod](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/how-to/privileged.md#containerd).

Using privileged containers lead to root access in the guest VM, but remain isolated from the host.

Privileged pods, even on Pod Sandboxing, should only be used when necessary. Privileged pods should continue to be [managed by trusted users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#privileged).

### Host path storage volumes

`hostPath`

volumes can be mounted into Kata pods. In Pod Sandboxing, using `hostPath`

volumes can potentially undermine the isolation that Kata provides; since part of the host filesystem is exposed directly to the container, a potential attack vector is opened. The warnings posed by [upstream](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) should be considered as relevant for Pod Sandboxing as well.

There are some exceptions; files under `/dev`

are mounted into the container from the guest system instead of the host system. This helps maintain pod isolation for situations where this path must be mounted to function.

Warning

Unless necessary, the recommendation is to *avoid* using hostPath storage volumes.

#### Blocking hostPath via Azure Policy

[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) allows users to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on their cluster components in a centralized, consistent manner.

There is a set of [built-in policy sets](policy-reference) for AKS that enforce best practices. Users can take advantage of one of these policies to block deployments that attempt to mount hostPaths.

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service control plane metrics (preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to monitor the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) control plane by using control plane metrics in Azure Monitor.

AKS supports a subset of control plane metrics free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks#aks-monitoring-data-metrics-logs-integrations). The control plane metrics feature gives you visibility into the availability and performance of critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, the scheduler, the autoscaler, and the controller manager in AKS. The feature is also fully compatible with the managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana. You can use these metrics to maximize overall observability and to maintain operational excellence for your AKS cluster.

## Control plane platform metrics

AKS offers some free control plane metrics for monitoring the API server and etcd. These metrics are automatically collected for all AKS clusters at no cost. You can analyze the metrics by using the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics) in the Azure portal. You can also create metrics-based alerts by using the metrics data.

To see the full list of supported control plane platform metrics, see the [AKS monitoring reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

## Prerequisites and limitations

- The control plane metrics (preview) feature supports only the
[managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)in Azure Monitor. [Azure Private Link](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/private-link-security)isn't supported.- You can customize only the default
configmap file. No other customization is supported.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

- Your AKS cluster must use
[managed identity authentication](use-managed-identity).

### Install the aks-preview extension

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Install or update the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension by using theor`az extension add`

command:`az extension update`

`# Install the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview feature flag

Register the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag by using thecommand:`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show as

**Registered**.Verify the registration status by using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`

When the status is

**Registered**, refresh the registration of the Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider by using thecommand:`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"`


## Enable control plane metrics on an AKS cluster

Enable control plane metrics by using the managed service for Prometheus add-on when you create a new cluster or update an existing cluster.

Note

Unlike the metrics that are collected from cluster nodes, control plane metrics are collected by a component that isn't part of the `ama-metrics`

add-on. Enabling the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag and the managed service for Prometheus add-on ensures that control plane metrics are collected. After you enable metrics collection, it can take several minutes for the data to appear in the workspace.

### New AKS cluster

To learn how to collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from your AKS cluster, see [Enable Prometheus and Grafana for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana). For an AKS cluster, complete the steps described on the **CLI** tab.

### Existing AKS cluster

If your cluster already has the managed service for Prometheus add-on, update the cluster to ensure that it collects control plane metrics by using the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command:

```
az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Query control plane metrics

Control plane metrics are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace in the cluster's region. You can query the metrics directly in the workspace or by using the Azure Managed Grafana instance that's connected to the workspace.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your AKS cluster resource.On the left menu, select

**Monitor**>**Monitor Settings**.Go to the Azure Monitor workspace that is linked to the cluster.

In the Azure Monitor workspace, under

**Managed Prometheus**, query the metrics by using the Prometheus explorer.

Note

AKS provides dashboard templates to help you view and analyze your control plane telemetry data in real time. If you use Azure Managed Grafana to visualize the data, you can import the following dashboards:

## Customize control plane metrics

AKS includes a preconfigured set of metrics to collect and store for each component. Metrics for the API server and etcd are collected by default. You can customize the list of metrics that are collected by modifying the [ ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/prometheus-collector/blob/main/otelcollector/configmaps/ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml) configmap file.

Default targets include the following values:

```
controlplane-apiserver = true
controlplane-cluster-autoscaler = false
controlplace-node-auto-provisioning = false
controlplane-kube-scheduler = false
controlplane-kube-controller-manager = false
controlplane-etcd = true
```


All configmap files should be applied to the `kube-system`

namespace for any cluster.

### Customize an ingestion profile

You can customize an ingestion file for collected metrics. For more information, see [Minimal ingestion profile for control plane metrics in managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration-minimal#minimal-ingestion-for-default-on-targets).

#### Ingest only minimal metrics from default targets

- Set
`default-targets-metrics-keep-list.minimalIngestionProfile`

to`true`

, so it ingests only the minimal set of metrics for each of the default targets:`controlplane-apiserver`

and`controlplane-etcd`

.

#### Ingest all metrics from all targets

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`false`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplace-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Apply the configmap file by using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest more than minimal metrics

Using the `minimalingestionprofile`

setting helps reduce the ingestion volume of metrics. If set to `true`

, only default recording rules, default alerts, and metrics that appear in the default dashboards are collected.

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`true`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplane-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Under

`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

, specify the list of metrics for the`true`

targets.For example:

`controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds|apiserver_longrunning_requests"`

Apply the configmap file by using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

#### Ingest specific metrics from specific targets

Download the

configmap file.`ama-metrics-settings-configmap.yaml`

Rename the configmap file

`configmap-controlplane.yaml`

.Set

`minimalingestionprofile`

to`false`

.Under

`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

, verify that the targets that you want to scrape are set to`true`

.The targets you can set are:

`controlplane-apiserver`

`controlplane-cluster-autoscaler`

`controlplane-node-auto-provisioning`

`controlplane-kube-scheduler`

`controlplane-kube-controller-manager`

`controlplane-etcd`


Under

`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

, specify the list of metrics for the`true`

targets.For example:

`controlplane-apiserver= "apiserver_admission_webhook_admission_duration_seconds|apiserver_longrunning_requests"`

Apply the configmap file:

`kubectl apply -f configmap-controlplane.yaml`


After you apply the configuration, it takes several minutes for the metrics from the specified targets that are scraped from the control plane to appear in the Azure Monitor workspace.

## Troubleshoot control plane metrics issues

Make sure that the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag is enabled and that the `ama-metrics`

pods are running.

Note

The [troubleshooting methods](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot) for the managed service for Prometheus don't apply directly in this scenario. The components that scrape the control plane aren't included in the managed service for Prometheus add-on.

**Configmap file formatting**: Make sure that you use the correct formatting in the configmap file. Verify that the fields`default-targets-metrics-keep-list`

,`minimal-ingestion-profile`

, and`default-scrape-settings-enabled`

and other fields are correctly populated with their intended values.**Isolate the control plane from the data plane**: Start by setting some of the[node-related metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default)to`true`

, and then verify that the metrics are forwarded to the workspace. Completing these steps helps you determine whether an issue is specific to scraping control plane metrics.**A change in the number of events ingested**: After you apply the changes, you can open the metrics explorer in the Azure portal. Go to the Azure Monitor overview pane for the cluster or go to the**Monitoring**section of the selected cluster. Check for an increase or a decrease in the number of events ingested per minute. This information can help you determine whether a specific metric is missing or if all metrics are missing.**A specific metric isn't exposed**: In some scenarios, a metric is documented, but it isn't exposed from the target and isn't forwarded to the Azure Monitor workspace. In this case, it's necessary to verify that other metrics are forwarded to the workspace.Note

If you want to collect the

`apiserver_request_duration_seconds`

metric or another bucket metric, you must set the entire series in the histogram family:`controlplane-apiserver = "apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum|apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count"`

**No access to the Azure Monitor workspace**: When you enable the add-on, you might specify an existing workspace that you can't access. In that scenario, it appears that metrics aren't collected and forwarded. Make sure that you create a new workspace to use to collect metrics when you enable the add-on or when you create the cluster.

## Disable control plane metrics on your AKS cluster

You can disable control plane metrics at any time by disabling the managed service for Prometheus add-on and unregistering the `AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag.

Remove the metrics add-on that scrapes Prometheus metrics by using the

command:`az aks update`

`az aks update --disable-azure-monitor-metrics --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`

To disable scraping control plane metrics on the AKS cluster, unregister the

`AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview`

feature flag via thecommand:`az feature unregister`

`az feature unregister "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureMonitorMetricsControlPlanePreview"`


## Frequently asked questions

### Can I scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus?

No. Currently, you can't scrape control plane metrics by using self-hosted Prometheus. Self-hosted Prometheus can scrape only a single instance, depending on the load balancer, so the metrics aren't reliable. Often, multiple replicas of the control plane metrics are visible only through the managed service for Prometheus.

### Why isn't the user agent available in the control plane metrics?

In AKS, [control plane metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/) don't have the user agent. The user agent is available only through the control plane logs that you access in [diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

Important

On **31 March 2028**, kubenet networking for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will be retired.

To avoid service disruptions, **you'll need to** [upgrade to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane#upgrade-an-existing-cluster-to-azure-cni-overlay) **before that date**, when workloads running on kubenet for AKS will no longer be supported.

As you create and manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you provide network connectivity for your nodes and applications. These network resources include IP address ranges, load balancers, and ingress controllers.

This best practices article focuses on network connectivity and security for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Explain Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) network mode in AKS.
- Plan for required IP addressing and connectivity.
- Distribute traffic using load balancers, ingress controllers, or a web application firewall (WAF).
- Securely connect to cluster nodes.

## Choose the appropriate network model


Best practice guidanceUse Azure CNI networking in AKS for integration with existing virtual networks or on-premises networks. This network model allows greater separation of resources and controls in an enterprise environment.


Virtual networks provide the basic connectivity for AKS nodes and customers to access your applications. There are two different ways to deploy AKS clusters into virtual networks:

**Azure CNI networking**: Deploys into a virtual network and uses the[Azure CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md)Kubernetes plugin. Pods receive individual IPs that can route to other network services or on-premises resources.

Azure CNI is a valid option for production deployments.

### CNI Networking

Azure CNI is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. It assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network. There's no need for extra routing to communicate with other resources or services.

Notably, Azure CNI networking for production allows for separation of control and management of resources. From a security perspective, you often want different teams to manage and secure those resources. With Azure CNI networking, you connect to existing Azure resources, on-premises resources, or other services directly via IP addresses assigned to each pod.

When you use Azure CNI networking, the virtual network resource is in a separate resource group to the AKS cluster. Delegate permissions for the AKS cluster identity to access and manage these resources. The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network.

If you wish to define a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


By default, AKS uses a managed identity for its cluster identity. However, you can use a service principal instead.

- For more information about AKS service principal delegation, see
[Delegate access to other Azure resources](kubernetes-service-principal#delegate-access-to-other-azure-resources). - For more information about managed identities, see
[Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

As each node and pod receives its own IP address, plan out the address ranges for the AKS subnets. Keep the following criteria in mind:

- The subnet must be large enough to provide IP addresses for every node, pod, and network resource you deploy.
- With Azure CNI networking, each running node has default limits to the number of pods.

- Avoid using IP address ranges that overlap with existing network resources.
- It's necessary to allow connectivity to on-premises or peered networks in Azure.

- To handle scale-out events or cluster upgrades, you need extra IP addresses available in the assigned subnet.
- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see
[Upgrade a node pool in AKS](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool).

- This extra address space is especially important if you use Windows Server containers, as those node pools require an upgrade to apply the latest security patches. For more information on Windows Server nodes, see

To calculate the IP address required, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

When creating a cluster with Azure CNI networking, you specify other address ranges for the cluster, such as the Docker bridge address, DNS service IP, and service address range. In general, make sure these address ranges don't overlap each other or any networks associated with the cluster, including any virtual networks, subnets, on-premises and peered networks.

For the specific details around limits and sizing for these address ranges, see [Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni).

## Distribute ingress traffic


Best practice guidanceTo distribute HTTP or HTTPS traffic to your applications, use ingress resources and controllers. Compared to an Azure load balancer, ingress controllers provide extra features and can be managed as native Kubernetes resources.


While an Azure load balancer can distribute customer traffic to applications in your AKS cluster, it's limited in understanding that traffic. A load balancer resource works at *layer 4* and distributes traffic based on protocol or ports.

Most web applications using HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at *layer 7*. Ingress can distribute traffic based on the URL of the application and handle TLS/SSL termination. Ingress also reduces the number of IP addresses you expose and map.

With a load balancer, each application typically needs a public IP address assigned and mapped to the service in the AKS cluster. With an ingress resource, a single IP address can distribute traffic to multiple applications.

There are two components for ingress:

- An ingress
*resource* - An ingress
*controller*

### Ingress resource

The *ingress resource* is a YAML manifest of `kind: Ingress`

. It defines the host, certificates, and rules to route traffic to services running in your AKS cluster.

The following example YAML manifest distributes traffic for *myapp.com* to one of two services, *blogservice* or *storeservice*, and directs the customer to one service or the other based on the URL they access.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: myapp-ingress
spec:
ingressClassName: PublicIngress
tls:
- hosts:
- myapp.com
secretName: myapp-secret
rules:
- host: myapp.com
http:
paths:
- path: /blog
backend:
service:
name: blogservice
port: 80
- path: /store
backend:
service:
name: storeservice
port: 80
```


### Ingress controller

An *ingress controller* is a daemon that runs on an AKS node and watches for incoming requests. Traffic is then distributed based on the rules defined in the ingress resource. While the most common ingress controller is based on [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/kubernetes-ingress-controller), AKS doesn't restrict you to a specific controller. You can use [Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview), [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour), [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org), [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik), etc.

Ingress controllers must be scheduled on a Linux node. Indicate that the resource should run on a Linux-based node using a node selector in your YAML manifest or Helm chart deployment. For more information, see [Use node selectors to control where pods are scheduled in AKS](concepts-clusters-workloads#node-selectors).

## Ingress with the application routing addon

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed, ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing add-on, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Secure traffic with a web application firewall (WAF)


Best practice guidanceTo scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as

[Barracuda WAF for Azure]or[Azure Application Gateway for Containers]. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic TLS termination.

Typically, an ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource in your AKS cluster that distributes traffic to services and applications. The controller runs as a daemon on an AKS node, and consumes some of the node's resources, like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. In larger environments, you may want to consider the following:

- Offload some of this traffic routing or TLS termination to a network resource outside of the AKS cluster.
- Scan incoming traffic for potential attacks.

For that extra layer of security, a web application firewall (WAF) filters the incoming traffic. With a set of rules, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) watches for attacks like cross-site scripting or cookie poisoning. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) is a WAF that integrates with AKS clusters, locking in these security features before the traffic reaches your AKS cluster and applications.

Since other third-party solutions also perform these functions, you can continue to use existing investments or expertise in your preferred product.

Load balancer or ingress resources continually run in your AKS cluster and refine the traffic distribution. [Azure Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/overview) can be centrally managed as an ingress controller with a resource definition. To get started, [create an Application Gateway for Containers](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/for-containers/quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller).

## Control traffic flow with network policies


Best practice guidanceUse network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication.


Network policy is a Kubernetes feature available in AKS that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You allow or deny traffic to the pod based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. Network policies are a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic for pods. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, required network policies can be automatically applied.

To use [network policies in AKS](use-network-policies), the feature can be enabled either during cluster creation or on an existing AKS cluster. If you are planning to use network policies, ensure the feature is enabled on your AKS cluster.

Note

Network policies could be used for Linux-based or Windows-based nodes and pods in AKS.

You create a network policy as a Kubernetes resource using a YAML manifest. Policies are applied to defined pods, with ingress or egress rules defining traffic flow.

The following example applies a network policy to pods with the *app: backend* label applied to them. The ingress rule only allows traffic from pods with the *app: frontend* label.

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: backend-policy
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: backend
ingress:
- from:
- podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: frontend
```


To get started with policies, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-network-policies).

## Securely connect to nodes through a bastion host


Best practice guidanceDon't expose remote connectivity to your AKS nodes. Create a bastion host, or jump box, in a management virtual network. Use the bastion host to securely route traffic into your AKS cluster to remote management tasks.


You can complete most operations in AKS using the Azure management tools or through the Kubernetes API server. AKS nodes are only available on a private network and aren't connected to the public internet. To connect to nodes and provide maintenance and support, route your connections through a bastion host, or jump box. Verify this host lives in a separate, securely peered management virtual network to the AKS cluster virtual network.

You should also secure the management network for the bastion host. Use an [Azure ExpressRoute](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [VPN gateway](/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) to connect to an on-premises network and control access using network security groups.
