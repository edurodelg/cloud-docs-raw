# Deploy and configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy and configure an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview). The steps in this article include:

- Create a new or update an existing AKS cluster using the Azure CLI with OpenID Connect (OIDC) issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID enabled.
- Create a workload identity and Kubernetes service account.
- Configure the managed identity for token federation.
- Deploy the workload and verify authentication with the workload identity.
- Optionally grant a pod in the cluster access to secrets in an Azure key vault.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure account, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - This article requires version 2.47.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- Make sure that the identity that you're using to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more information, see
[Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity). - If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription ID in which the resources should be billed using the
command.`az account set`


Note

You can use *Service Connector* to help you configure some steps automatically. For more information, see [Tutorial: Connect to Azure storage account in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Service Connector using Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/service-connector/tutorial-python-aks-storage-workload-identity).

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RANDOM_ID="$(openssl rand -hex 3)" export RESOURCE_GROUP="myResourceGroup$RANDOM_ID" export LOCATION="<your-preferred-region>" az group create --name "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --location "${LOCATION}"`


## Enable OIDC issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

You can enable OIDC issuer and Microsoft Entra Workload ID on a new or existing AKS cluster.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-oidc-issuer`

parameter to enable OIDC issuer and the`--enable-workload-identity`

parameter to enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following example creates a cluster with a single node:`export CLUSTER_NAME="myAKSCluster$RANDOM_ID" az aks create \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --enable-oidc-issuer \ --enable-workload-identity \ --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the [

`az aks show`

][az-aks-show] command.`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" \ --output tsv)"`

The environment variable should contain the issuer URL, similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/`

By default, the issuer is set to use the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{tenant_id}/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location to which the AKS cluster is deployed. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key, which is a randomly generated and immutable GUID for each cluster.

## Create a managed identity

Get your subscription ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az account show`

][az-account-show] command.`export SUBSCRIPTION="$(az account show --query id --output tsv)"`

Create a user-assigned managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME="myIdentity$RANDOM_ID" az identity create \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --location "${LOCATION}" \ --subscription "${SUBSCRIPTION}"`

The following output example shows successful creation of a managed identity:

`{ "clientId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myResourceGroupxxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentityxxxxxx", "location": "eastus", "name": "myIdentityxxxxxx", "principalId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroupxxxxxx", "systemData": null, "tags": {}, "tenantId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities" }`

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --query 'clientId' \ --output tsv)"`


## Create a Kubernetes service account

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}"`

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the client ID of the managed identity by applying the following manifest using the

`kubectl apply`

command:`export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="workload-identity-sa$RANDOM_ID" export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE="default" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: "${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID}" name: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" namespace: "${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}" EOF`

The following output shows successful creation of the workload identity:

`serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Create the federated identity credential

Create a federated identity credential between the managed identity, the service account issuer, and the subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`export FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME="myFedIdentity$RANDOM_ID" az identity federated-credential create \ --name ${FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CREDENTIAL_NAME} \ --identity-name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --issuer "${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER}" \ --subject system:serviceaccount:"${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}":"${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" \ --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

Note

It takes a few seconds for the federated identity credential to propagate after it's added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the request might fail until the cache is refreshed. To avoid this issue, you can add a slight delay after adding the federated identity credential.


For more information about federated identity credentials in Microsoft Entra, see [Overview of federated identity credentials in Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview).

## Create a key vault with Azure RBAC authorization

The following example shows how to use the Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permission model to grant the pod access to the key vault. For more information about the Azure RBAC permission model for Azure Key Vault, see [Grant permission to applications to access an Azure key vault using Azure RBAC](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide).

Create a key vault with purge protection and Azure RBAC authorization enabled using the [

`az keyvault create`

][az-keyvault-create] command. You can also use an existing key vault if it's configured for both purge protection and Azure RBAC authorization:`export KEYVAULT_NAME="keyvault-workload-id$RANDOM_ID" # Ensure the key vault name is between 3-24 characters az keyvault create \ --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --location "${LOCATION}" \ --enable-purge-protection \ --enable-rbac-authorization`

Get the key vault resource ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az keyvault show`

][az-keyvault-show] command.`export KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID=$(az keyvault show --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --query id \ --output tsv)`


### Assign RBAC permissions for key vault management

Get the caller object ID and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az ad signed-in-user show`

][az-ad-signed-in-user-show] command.`export CALLER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)`

Assign yourself the Azure RBAC

[Key Vault Secrets Officer](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-secrets-officer)role so that you can create a secret in the new key vault using the [`az role assignment create`

][az-role-assignment-create] command.`az role assignment create --assignee "${CALLER_OBJECT_ID}" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets Officer" \ --scope "${KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID}"`


### Create and configure secret access

Create a secret in the key vault using the [

`az keyvault secret set`

][az-keyvault-secret-set] command.`export KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME="my-secret$RANDOM_ID" az keyvault secret set \ --vault-name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" \ --name "${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME}" \ --value "Hello\!"`

Get the principal ID of the user-assigned managed identity and save it to an environment variable using the [

`az identity show`

][az-identity-show] command.`export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az identity show \ --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --query principalId \ --output tsv)`

Assign the

[Key Vault Secrets User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/security#key-vault-secrets-user)role to the user-assigned managed identity using the [`az role assignment create`

][az-role-assignment-create] command. This step gives the managed identity permission to read secrets from the key vault.`az role assignment create \ --assignee-object-id "${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID}" \ --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \ --scope "${KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID}" \ --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal`

Create an environment variable for the key vault URL using the [

`az keyvault show`

][az-keyvault-show] command:`export KEYVAULT_URL="$(az keyvault show \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name ${KEYVAULT_NAME} \ --query properties.vaultUri \ --output tsv)"`


## Deploy a verification pod and test access

Deploy a pod to verify that the workload identity can access the secret in the key vault. The following example uses the

`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go`

image, which contains a sample application that retrieves a secret from Azure Key Vault using Microsoft Entra Workload ID:`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: sample-workload-identity-key-vault namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" spec: serviceAccountName: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} containers: - image: ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go name: oidc env: - name: KEYVAULT_URL value: ${KEYVAULT_URL} - name: SECRET_NAME value: ${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME} nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/os: linux EOF`

Wait for the pod to be in the

`Ready`

state using the`kubectl wait`

command.`kubectl wait --namespace ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} --for=condition=Ready pod/sample-workload-identity-key-vault --timeout=120s`

Check that the

`SECRET_NAME`

environment variable is set in the pod using thecommand.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pod sample-workload-identity-key-vault | grep "SECRET_NAME:"`

If successful, the output should be similar to the following example:

`SECRET_NAME: ${KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME}`

Verify that pods can get a token and access the resource using the

`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs sample-workload-identity-key-vault`

If successful, the output should be similar to the following example:

`I0114 10:35:09.795900 1 main.go:63] "successfully got secret" secret="Hello\\!"`

Important

Azure RBAC role assignments can take up to 10 minutes to propagate. If the pod is unable to access the secret, you might need to wait for the role assignment to propagate. For more information, see

[Troubleshoot Azure RBAC](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/troubleshooting#).

## Disable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an AKS cluster

Disable Microsoft Entra Workload ID on the AKS cluster where it's been enabled and configured, update the AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-workload-identity`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" \ --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --disable-workload-identity`


## Related content

In this article, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and configured it to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID in preparation for application workloads to authenticate with that credential. Now you're ready to deploy your application and configure it to use the workload identity with the latest version of the [Azure Identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries) client library. If you can't rewrite your application to use the latest client library version, you can [set up your application pod](workload-identity-migrate-from-pod-identity) to authenticate using managed identity with workload identity as a short-term migration solution.

The [Service Connector](/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview) integration helps simplify the connection configuration for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. It securely handles authentication and network configurations and follows best practices for connecting to Azure services. For more information, see [Connect to Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models in AKS using Microsoft Entra Workload Identity](/en-us/azure/service-connector/tutorial-python-aks-openai-workload-identity) and the [Service Connector introduction](https://blog.aks.azure.com/2024/05/23/service-connector-intro).

# Best practices for authentication and authorization in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you deploy and maintain clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you implement ways to manage access to resources and services. Without these controls:

- Accounts could have access to unnecessary resources and services.
- Tracking credentials used to make changes can be difficult.

In this article, we discuss what recommended practices a cluster operator can follow to manage access and identity for AKS clusters. You'll learn how to:

- Authenticate AKS cluster users with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Control access to resources with Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC).
- Use Azure RBAC to granularly control access to the AKS resource, the Kubernetes API at scale, and the
`kubeconfig`

. - Use a
[workload identity](workload-identity-overview)to access Azure resources from your pods.

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

## Use Microsoft Entra ID


Best practice guidanceDeploy AKS clusters with

[Microsoft Entra integration]. Using Microsoft Entra ID centralizes the identity management layer. Any change in user account or group status is automatically updated in access to the AKS cluster. Scope users or groups to the minimum permissions amount using[Roles, ClusterRoles, or Bindings].

Your Kubernetes cluster developers and application owners need access to different resources. Kubernetes lacks an identity management solution for you to control the resources with which users can interact. Instead, you can integrate your cluster with an existing identity solution like Microsoft Entra ID, an enterprise-ready identity management solution.

With Microsoft Entra integrated clusters in AKS, you create *Roles* or *ClusterRoles* defining access permissions to resources. You then *bind* the roles to users or groups from Microsoft Entra ID. Learn more about these Kubernetes RBAC in [the next section](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac). Microsoft Entra integration and how you control access to resources can be seen in the following diagram:

- Developer authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID.
- The Microsoft Entra token issuance endpoint issues the access token.
- The developer performs an action using the Microsoft Entra token, such as
`kubectl create pod`

. - Kubernetes validates the token with Microsoft Entra ID and fetches the developer's group memberships.
- Kubernetes RBAC and cluster policies are applied.
- The developer's request is successful based on previous validation of Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC and policies.

To create an AKS cluster that uses Microsoft Entra ID, see [Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](enable-authentication-microsoft-entra-id).

## Use Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)


Best practice guidanceDefine user or group permissions to cluster resources with Kubernetes RBAC. Create roles and bindings that assign the least amount of permissions required. Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID to automatically update any user status or group membership change and keep access to cluster resources current.


In Kubernetes, you provide granular access control to cluster resources. You define permissions at the cluster level, or to specific namespaces. You determine what resources can be managed and with what permissions. You then apply these roles to users or groups with a binding. For more information about *Roles*, *ClusterRoles*, and *Bindings*, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity).

For example, you create a role with full access to resources in the namespace named *finance-app*, as shown in the following example YAML manifest:

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role
namespace: finance-app
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
resources: ["*"]
verbs: ["*"]
```


You then create a *RoleBinding* and bind the Microsoft Entra user *developer1@contoso.com* to it, as shown in the following YAML manifest:

```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: finance-app-full-access-role-binding
namespace: finance-app
subjects:
- kind: User
name: developer1@contoso.com
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
kind: Role
name: finance-app-full-access-role
apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


When *developer1@contoso.com* is authenticated against the AKS cluster, they have full permissions to resources in the *finance-app* namespace. In this way, you logically separate and control access to resources. Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID-integration.

To learn how to use Microsoft Entra groups to control access to Kubernetes resources using Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using role-based access control and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

## Use Azure RBAC


Best practice guidanceUse Azure RBAC to define the minimum required user and group permissions to AKS resources in one or more subscriptions.


There are two levels of access needed to fully operate an AKS cluster:

Access the AKS resource on your Azure subscription.

This access level allows you to:

- Control scaling or upgrading your cluster using the AKS APIs
- Pull your
`kubeconfig`

.

To learn how to control access to the AKS resource and the

`kubeconfig`

, see[Limit access to cluster configuration file](control-kubeconfig-access).Access to the Kubernetes API.

This access level is controlled either by:

[Kubernetes RBAC](#use-kubernetes-role-based-access-control-kubernetes-rbac)(traditionally) or- By integrating Azure RBAC with AKS for kubernetes authorization.

To learn how to granularly grant permissions to the Kubernetes API using Azure RBAC, see

[Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization](manage-azure-rbac).

## Use pod-managed identities

Warning

The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022.

If you have [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) enabled on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you **review the workload identity overview article** to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.

Don't use fixed credentials within pods or container images, as they are at risk of exposure or abuse. Instead, use *pod identities* to automatically request access using Microsoft Entra ID.

To access other Azure resources, like Azure Cosmos DB, Key Vault, or Blob storage, the pod needs authentication credentials. You could define authentication credentials with the container image or inject them as a Kubernetes secret. Either way, you would need to manually create and assign them. Usually, these credentials are reused across pods and aren't regularly rotated.

With pod-managed identities (preview) for Azure resources, you automatically request access to services through Microsoft Entra ID. Pod-managed identities is currently in preview for AKS. Refer to the [Use Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities in Azure Kubernetes Service (Preview)](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) documentation to get started.

Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) supports two modes of operation:

**Standard**mode: In this mode, the following 2 components are deployed to the AKS cluster:[Managed Identity Controller(MIC)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/mic/): A Kubernetes controller that watches for changes to pods,[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)through the Kubernetes API Server. When it detects a relevant change, the MIC adds or deletes[AzureAssignedIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureassignedidentity/)as needed. Specifically, when a pod is scheduled, the MIC assigns the managed identity on Azure to the underlying virtual machine scale set used by the node pool during the creation phase. When all pods using the identity are deleted, it removes the identity from the virtual machine scale set of the node pool, unless the same managed identity is used by other pods. The MIC takes similar actions when AzureIdentity or AzureIdentityBinding are created or deleted.[Node Managed Identity (NMI)](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/nmi/): is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. NMI intercepts security token requests to the[Azure Instance Metadata Service](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/instance-metadata-service?tabs=linux)on each node. It redirects requests to itself and validates if the pod has access to the identity it's requesting a token for, and fetch the token from the Microsoft Entra tenant on behalf of the application.

**Managed**mode: In this mode, there's only NMI. The identity needs to be manually assigned and managed by the user. For more information, see[Pod Identity in Managed Mode](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/configure/pod_identity_in_managed_mode/). In this mode, when you use the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command to add a pod identity to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, it creates the[AzureIdentity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/)and[AzureIdentityBinding](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentitybinding/)in the namespace specified by the`--namespace`

parameter, while the AKS resource provider assigns the managed identity specified by the`--identity-resource-id`

parameter to virtual machine scale set of each node pool in the AKS cluster.

Note

If you instead decide to install the Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity using the [AKS cluster add-on](use-azure-ad-pod-identity), setup uses the `managed`

mode.

The `managed`

mode provides the following advantages over the `standard`

:

- Identity assignment on the virtual machine scale set of a node pool can take up 40-60s. With cronjobs or applications that require access to the identity and can't tolerate the assignment delay, it's best to use
`managed`

mode as the identity is pre-assigned to the virtual machine scale set of the node pool. Either manually or using the[az aks pod-identity add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/pod-identity#az-aks-pod-identity-add)command. - In
`standard`

mode, MIC requires write permissions on the virtual machine scale set used by the AKS cluster and`Managed Identity Operator`

permission on the user-assigned managed identities. When running in`managed mode`

, since there's no MIC, the role assignments aren't required.

Instead of manually defining credentials for pods, pod-managed identities request an access token in real time, using it to access only their assigned resources. In AKS, there are two components that handle the operations to allow pods to use managed identities:

**The Node Management Identity (NMI) server**is a pod that runs as a DaemonSet on each node in the AKS cluster. The NMI server listens for pod requests to Azure services.**The Azure Resource Provider**queries the Kubernetes API server and checks for an Azure identity mapping that corresponds to a pod.

When pods request a security token from Microsoft Entra ID to access to an Azure resource, network rules redirect the traffic to the NMI server.

The NMI server:

- Identifies pods requesting access to Azure resources based on their remote address.
- Queries the Azure Resource Provider.

The Azure Resource Provider checks for Azure identity mappings in the AKS cluster.

The NMI server requests an access token from Microsoft Entra ID based on the pod's identity mapping.

Microsoft Entra ID provides access to the NMI server, which is returned to the pod.

- This access token can be used by the pod to then request access to resources in Azure.


In the following example, a developer creates a pod that uses a managed identity to request access to Azure SQL Database:

- Cluster operator creates a service account to map identities when pods request access to resources.
- The NMI server is deployed to relay any pod requests, along with the Azure Resource Provider, for access tokens to Microsoft Entra ID.
- A developer deploys a pod with a managed identity that requests an access token through the NMI server.
- The token is returned to the pod and used to access Azure SQL Database
