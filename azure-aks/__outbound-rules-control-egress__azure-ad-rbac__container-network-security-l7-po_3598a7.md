# Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides the necessary details that allow you to secure outbound traffic from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It contains the cluster requirements for a base AKS deployment and additional requirements for optional addons and features. You can apply this information to any outbound restriction method or appliance.

To see an example configuration using Azure Firewall, visit [Control egress traffic using Azure Firewall in AKS](limit-egress-traffic).

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Background

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network. This network can either be customized and preconfigured by you or it can be created and managed by AKS. In either case, the cluster has **outbound**, or egress, dependencies on services outside of the virtual network.

For management and operational purposes, nodes in an AKS cluster need to access certain ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). These endpoints are required for the nodes to communicate with the API server or to download and install core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates. For example, the cluster needs to pull container images from Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR).

The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means you can't use network security groups (NSGs) to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound internet access. This level of network access allows nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. For outbound internet traffic, it's not recommended to set all deny rules in an NSG.

A [network isolated AKS cluster](concepts-network-isolated), provides the simplest and most secure solution for setting up outbound restrictions for a cluster out of the box. A network isolated cluster pulls the images for cluster components and add-ons from a private Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance connected to the cluster instead of pulling from MAR. If the images aren't present, the private ACR pulls them from MAR and serves them via its private endpoint, eliminating the need to enable egress from the cluster to the public MAR endpoint. The cluster operator can then incrementally set up allowed outbound traffic securely over a private network for each scenario they want to enable. This way the cluster operators have complete control over designing the allowed outbound traffic from their clusters right from the start, thus allowing them to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.

Another solution to securing outbound addresses is using a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination. You can also configure your preferred firewall and security rules to allow these required ports and addresses.

Important

This document covers only how to lock down the traffic leaving the AKS subnet. AKS has no ingress requirements by default. Blocking **internal subnet traffic** using network security groups (NSGs) and firewalls isn't supported. To control and block the traffic within the cluster, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).

## Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters

The following network and FQDN/application rules are required for an AKS cluster. You can use them if you wish to configure a solution other than Azure Firewall.

- IP address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic).
- FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
- Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your AKS cluster based on a number of qualifiers.
- AKS uses an admission controller to inject the FQDN as an environment variable to all deployments under kube-system and gatekeeper-system. This ensures all system communication between nodes and API server uses the API server FQDN and not the API server IP. You can get the same behavior on your own pods, in any namespace, by annotating the pod spec with an annotation named
`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

. If that annotation is present, AKS will set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This is useful in cases where the cluster egress is via a layer 7 firewall. - If you have an app or solution that needs to talk to the API server, you must either add an
**additional**network rule to allow**TCP communication to port 443 of your API server's IP****OR**, if you have a layer 7 firewall configured to allow traffic to the API Server's domain name, set`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

in your pod specs. - On rare occasions, if there's a maintenance operation, your API server IP might change. Planned maintenance operations that can change the API server IP are always communicated in advance.
- You might notice traffic towards "md-*.blob.storage.azure.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used for internal components of Azure Managed Disks. Blocking access to this endpoint from your firewall should not cause any issues.
- You might notice traffic towards "umsa*.blob.core.windows.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used to store manifests for Azure Linux VM Agent & Extensions and is regularly checked to download new versions. You can find more details on
[VM Extensions](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/features-linux?tabs=azure-cli#network-access).

# Use Kubernetes RBAC with Microsoft Entra ID in AKS

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using a Microsoft Entra authentication token. Once authenticated, you can use the built-in Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to namespaces and cluster resources based on a user's identity or group membership.

This article shows you how to:

Control access using Kubernetes RBAC in an AKS cluster based on Microsoft Entra group membership.

Create example groups and users in Microsoft Entra ID.

Create Roles and RoleBindings in an AKS cluster granting the appropriate permissions, such as to create and view resources.


## Prerequisites

You have an existing AKS cluster with Microsoft Entra integration enabled. If you need an AKS cluster with this configuration, see

[Integrate Microsoft Entra ID with AKS](managed-azure-ad).Kubernetes RBAC is enabled by default during AKS cluster creation. To upgrade an existing cluster with Microsoft Entra integration and Kubernetes RBAC, see

[Enable Microsoft Entra integration on your existing AKS cluster](managed-azure-ad#use-an-existing-cluster).Make sure that Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later is installed and configured. To find the version, run

`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).If using Terraform, install

[Terraform](/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/overview)version 2.99.0 or later.

Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to verify Microsoft Entra integration with Kubernetes RBAC is enabled.

To verify using the Azure portal:

- Sign-in to the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)and navigate to your AKS cluster resource. - In the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Security configuration**. - Under the
**Authentication and Authorization**section, verify the**Microsoft Entra authentication with Kubernetes RBAC**option is selected.

## Create groups in Microsoft Entra ID

This section teaches you how to create two user roles to show how Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID control access cluster resources. The following two example roles are:

**Application developer**- A user named
*aksdev*that's part of the*appdev*group.

- A user named
**Site reliability engineer**(SRE)- A user named
*akssre*that's part of the*opssre*group.

- A user named

In production environments, you can use existing users and groups within a Microsoft Entra tenant.

First, get the resource ID of your AKS cluster using the

command. Then, assign the resource ID to a variable named`az aks show`

*AKS_ID*so it can be referenced in other commands.`AKS_ID=$(az aks show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --query id -o tsv)`

Create the first example group in Microsoft Entra ID for the application developers using the

command. The following example creates a group named`az ad group create`

*appdev*:`APPDEV_ID=$(az ad group create --display-name appdev --mail-nickname appdev --query id -o tsv)`

Create an Azure role assignment for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This assignment lets any member of the group use`az role assignment create`

`kubectl`

to interact with an AKS cluster by granting them the*Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User*Role.`az role assignment create \ --assignee $APPDEV_ID \ --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \ --scope $AKS_ID`

Tip

If you receive an error such as

`Principal 35bfec9328bd4d8d9b54dea6dac57b82 doesn't exist in the directory a5443dcd-cd0e-494d-a387-3039b419f0d5.`

, wait a few seconds for the Microsoft Entra group object ID to propagate through the directory then try the`az role assignment create`

command again.

## Create users in Microsoft Entra ID

After you create the example Microsoft Entra ID groups for application developers and SREs, the next step is to create two corresponding user accounts. These users are used to sign in to the AKS cluster and validate the Kubernetes RBAC integration described later in this article.

Before you begin, you must set the user principal name (UPN) and password for the application developers. The UPN must include the verified domain name of your tenant. For example, an application developer user, `aksdev@contoso.com`

. In order to figure out (or set) the verified domain names in your tenant, see [Managing custom domain names in your Microsoft Entra ID](/en-us/entra/identity/users/domains-manage).

The following command prompts you for the UPN and sets it to *AAD_DEV_UPN* so it can be used in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the UPN for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_UPN
```


The following command prompts you for the password and sets it to *AAD_DEV_PW* for use in a later command:

```
echo "Please enter the secure password for application developers: " && read AAD_DEV_PW
```


### Create user accounts

Create the first user account in Microsoft Entra ID using the

command. The following example creates a user with the display name`az ad user create`

*AKS Dev*, the UPN, and secure password using the values in*AAD_DEV_UPN*and*AAD_DEV_PW*:`AKSDEV_ID=$(az ad user create \ --display-name "AKS Dev" \ --user-principal-name $AAD_DEV_UPN \ --password $AAD_DEV_PW \ --query id -o tsv)`

Add the user to the

*appdev*group created in the previous section using thecommand:`az ad group member add`

`az ad group member add --group appdev --member-id $AKSDEV_ID`


## Create AKS cluster resources

We have our Microsoft Entra groups, users, and Azure role assignments created. Now, you configure the AKS cluster to allow these different groups access to specific resources.

Get the cluster admin credentials using the

command. In one of the following sections, you get the regular`az aks get-credentials`

*user*cluster credentials to see the Microsoft Entra authentication flow in action.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin`

Create a namespace in the AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a namespace name`kubectl create namespace`

*dev*:`kubectl create namespace dev`

Note

In Kubernetes,

*Roles*define the permissions to grant, and*RoleBindings*apply them to desired users or groups. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster. For more information, see[Using Kubernetes RBAC authorization](concepts-identity#kubernetes-rbac).If the user you grant the Kubernetes RBAC binding for is in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, assign permissions based on the

**UPN**. If the user is in a different Microsoft Entra tenant, query for and use the*objectId*property instead.Create a Role for the

*dev*namespace, which grants full permissions to the namespace. In production environments, you can specify more granular permissions for different users or groups. Create a file named`role-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:`kind: Role apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-full-access namespace: dev rules: - apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"] resources: ["*"] verbs: ["*"] - apiGroups: ["batch"] resources: - jobs - cronjobs verbs: ["*"]`

Create the Role using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f role-dev-namespace.yaml`

Get the resource ID for the

*appdev*group using thecommand. This group is set as the subject of a RoleBinding in the next step.`az ad group show`

`az ad group show --group appdev --query id -o tsv`

Create a RoleBinding for the

*appdev*group to use the previously created Role for namespace access. Create a file named`rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest. On the last line, replace*groupObjectId*with the group object ID output from the previous command.`kind: RoleBinding apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: dev-user-access namespace: dev roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: Role name: dev-user-full-access subjects: - kind: Group namespace: dev name: groupObjectId`

Tip

If you want to create the RoleBinding for a single user, specify

*kind: User*and replace*groupObjectId*with the UPN in the previous sample.Create the RoleBinding using the

command and specify the filename of your YAML manifest:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f rolebinding-dev-namespace.yaml`


## Access AKS cluster resources with Microsoft Entra identities

Now, test that the expected permissions work when you create and manage resources in an AKS cluster. In these examples, you schedule and view pods in the user's assigned namespace, and try to schedule and view pods outside of the assigned namespace.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand. In a previous section, you set the context using the cluster admin credentials. The admin user bypasses Microsoft Entra sign-in prompts. Without the`az aks get-credentials`

`--admin`

parameter, the user context is applied that requires all requests to be authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule a basic NGINX pod using the

command in the`kubectl run`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

Enter the credentials for the

*appdev*group account (enter*your*own credentials) at the sign-in prompt. Once you're successfully signed in, the account token is cached for future`kubectl`

commands. The NGINX is successfully scheduled as shown in the following example output:`$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code B24ZD6FP8 to authenticate. pod/nginx-dev created`

Use the

command to view pods in the`kubectl get pods`

*dev*namespace:`kubectl get pods --namespace dev`

Ensure the status of the NGINX pod is

*Running*. The output looks like the following output:`$ kubectl get pods --namespace dev NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-dev 1/1 Running 0 4m`


### Test SRE access to AKS cluster resources

To confirm that our Microsoft Entra group membership and Kubernetes RBAC work correctly between different users and groups, try the previous commands when signed in as the *akssre* user.

Reset the

*kubeconfig*context using thecommand that clears the previously cached authentication token for the`az aks get-credentials`

*aksdev*user.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --overwrite-existing`

Schedule and view pods in the assigned

*SRE*namespace. When prompted, sign in with the*opssre*group account credentials (enter*your*own credentials).`kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre kubectl get pods --namespace sre`

As shown in the following example output, you can successfully create and view the pods:

`$ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre`

To sign in, use a web browser to open the page

[https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin)and enter the code BM4RHP3FD to authenticate.`pod/nginx-sre created $ kubectl get pods --namespace sre NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-sre 1/1 Running 0`

Try to view or schedule pods outside of assigned SRE namespace.

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev`

These

`kubectl`

commands fail, as shown in the following example output. The user's group membership and Kubernetes Role and RoleBindings don't grant permissions to create or manager resources in other namespaces.`$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot list pods at the cluster scope $ kubectl run nginx-sre --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace dev Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create pods in the namespace "dev"`


### Create and view cluster resources outside of the assigned namespace

To view pods outside of the *dev* namespace. Use the [ kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command using

`--all-namespaces`

:```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```


The user's group membership doesn't have a Kubernetes Role that allows this action, as shown in the following example output:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "aksdev@contoso.com" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```


In the same way, schedule a pod in a different namespace, such as the *SRE* namespace. The user's group membership doesn't align with a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding to grant these permissions, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl run nginx-dev --image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine --namespace sre
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "akssre@contoso.com" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "sre"
```


### Clean up cluster resources

To clean up all of the resources, run the following commands:

```
# Get the admin kubeconfig context to delete the necessary cluster resources.
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --admin
# Delete the dev and SRE namespaces. This also deletes the pods, Roles, and RoleBindings.
kubectl delete namespace dev
kubectl delete namespace sre
# Delete the Azure AD user accounts for aksdev and akssre.
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSDEV_ID
az ad user delete --upn-or-object-id $AKSSRE_ID
# Delete the Azure AD groups for appdev and opssre. This also deletes the Azure role assignments.
az ad group delete --group appdev
az ad group delete --group opssre
```

# Overview of Layer 7 (L7) policy

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Network policies are essential for securing Kubernetes clusters by defining and controlling pod communication. They mitigate unauthorized access and potential security breaches by regulating traffic flow. Advanced Container Networking Services strengthens security with [FQDN-based network policies](container-network-security-fqdn-filtering-concepts). Expanding on this foundation, Advanced Container Networking Services now provides L7 policy support, enabling detailed inspection and management of application-level traffic. This advancement enhances both the security and efficiency of network communications within AKS clusters. The offering includes comprehensive support for widely adopted protocols, including HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka.

## Components of L7 policy

**Envoy proxy**: Envoy, part of ACNS security agent acts as the enforcement point for L7 policies. A TPROXY inspects application traffic, comparing it against the defined L7 policies. To enhance scalability and resource management, Envoy is deployed as a separate DaemonSet, decoupled from the Cilium Agent.

## How L7 policy works

When L7 policy enforcement is enabled for an application or pod, outgoing network traffic is first evaluated to determine compliance with the configured application-level rules. The eBPF probe attached to the source pod’s network interface marks the packets, which are then redirected to a node-local Envoy Proxy. This redirection occurs only for pods enforcing L7 policies, ensuring that policy enforcement is applied selectively.

The Envoy proxy, augmented with Cilium network filters, then decides whether to forward the traffic to the destination pod based on policy criteria. If permitted, the traffic proceeds; if not, Envoy returns an appropriate error code to the originating pod. Upon successful authorization, the Envoy proxy facilitates the traffic flow, providing application-level visibility and control. This allows the Cilium agent to enforce detailed network policies within the policy engine. The following diagram illustrates the high-level flow of L7 policy enforcement.

## Monitoring L7 traffic with Hubble and Grafana

To gain insights into L7 traffic flows, specifically HTTP, gRPC, and Kafka, Azure CNI Powered by Cilium leverages Hubble agent, which is enabled by default with Advanced Container Networking Services. Hubble provides detailed flow-level metrics.

To simplify the analysis of these L7 metrics, we provide pre-configured Azure Managed Grafana dashboards. You can find them under the **Dashboards > Azure Managed Prometheus** folder, with filenames like **"Kubernetes/Networking/L7 (Namespace)"** and **"Kubernetes/Networking/L7 (Workload)"**.

These dashboards offer granular visibility into L7 flow data at the cluster, namespace, and workload levels.

Note

These dashboards will only display data if you have this feature enabled on your cluster and have relevant policies applied.
Additionally, the monitoring metrics are **not** required to flow through Envoy, a component of the ACNS security agent. Rather, these metrics are collected by the Hubble agent, which is installed on your cluster as part of the Advanced Container Networking Service's observability feature.

## Key benefits

**Granular Application-Level Control**: L7 policies allow for fine-grained control over network traffic based on application-specific attributes, such as HTTP methods, gRPC paths, and Kafka topics. This extends beyond the basic IP address and port-based control of traditional network policies.

**Enhanced Security**: By inspecting application-level traffic, L7 policies can prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities at the application layer. This includes blocking unauthorized access to specific APIs or services. Furthermore, L7 policies are an important component of a Zero Trust security strategy, enabling the enforcement of the principle of least privilege at the application layer.

**Graceful Error Handling**: Unlike L3/L4 policies that typically drop unauthorized traffic silently, L7 policies can return application-level error codes (for example, HTTP 403, Kafka authorization failures), allowing applications to handle errors more gracefully.

**Observability**: With observability enabled for Advanced Container Networking Services and L7 policies applied to your AKS cluster, you can monitor traffic and policy effectiveness using Grafana dashboards.

## Limitations and considerations

- Current feature support relies on Cilium's Layer 7 policy enforcement based on HTTP, HTTPS, gRPC, and Kafka.
- The maximum supported cluster size is up to 1,000 nodes or 40,000 pods, whichever is greater.
- Traffic traversing Envoy proxies do come with latency. Users may experience noticeable latency degradation beyond 3,000 requests per second.
- As part of our observability solution, we provide envoy_http_rq_total metrics. These metrics give the total request count, which could be used to derive requests per seconds (rps).
- During a Cilium upgrade or rollout, existing sessions can be gracefully closed. Applications are expected to handle these interruptions gracefully—typically by implementing retry mechanisms at the connection or request level. New connections initiated during the rollout aren't impacted.
- L7 policy isn't supported by CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy(CCNP).
- L7 policy through Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) isn't compatible with L7 policies implemented via alternate methods such as Istio. The following table summarizes the supported scenarios.

| Feature/Component | L7 Policies using AKS, Istio - Managed addon |
|---|---|
| K8s network policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium | Supported |
| L4 (FQDN) Policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium and ACNS | Supported |
| L7 (HTTP(s)/GRPC/Kafka) Policies by Azure CNI powered by Cilium and ACNS | Not Supported |

# Tutorial - Use PaaS services with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

With Kubernetes, you can use PaaS services, such as [Azure Service Bus](/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview), to develop and run your applications.

In this tutorial, you create an Azure Service Bus namespace and queue to test your application. You learn how to:

- Create an Azure Service Bus namespace and queue.
- Update the Kubernetes manifest file to use the Azure Service Bus queue.
- Test the updated application by placing an order.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you packaged an application into a container image, uploaded the image to Azure Container Registry, created a Kubernetes cluster, and deployed an application. To complete this tutorial, you need the pre-created `aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

Kubernetes manifest file. This file download was included with the application source code in a previous tutorial. Make sure you cloned the repo and changed directories into the cloned repo. If you haven't completed these steps and want to follow along, start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create environment variables

Create the following environment variables to use for the commands in this tutorial:

`LOC_NAME=westus2 RAND=$RANDOM RG_NAME=myResourceGroup AKS_NAME=myAKSCluster SB_NS=sb-store-demo-$RAND`


## Create Azure Service Bus namespace and queue

In previous tutorials, you used a RabbitMQ container to store orders submitted by the `order-service`

. In this tutorial, you use an Azure Service Bus namespace to provide a scoping container for the Service Bus resources within the application. You also use an Azure Service bus queue to send and receive messages between the application components. For more information on Azure Service Bus, see [Create an Azure Service Bus namespace and queue](/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-cli).

Create an Azure Service Bus namespace using the

command.`az servicebus namespace create`

`az servicebus namespace create --name $SB_NS --resource-group $RG_NAME --location $LOC_NAME`

Create an Azure Service Bus queue using the

command.`az servicebus queue create`

`az servicebus queue create --name orders --resource-group $RG_NAME --namespace-name $SB_NS`

Create an Azure Service Bus authorization rule using the

command.`az servicebus queue authorization-rule create`

`az servicebus queue authorization-rule create \ --name sender \ --namespace-name $SB_NS \ --resource-group $RG_NAME \ --queue-name orders \ --rights Send`

Get the Azure Service Bus credentials for later use by using the

and`az servicebus namespace show`

commands.`az servicebus queue authorization-rule keys list`

`az servicebus namespace show --name $SB_NS --resource-group $RG_NAME --query name -o tsv az servicebus queue authorization-rule keys list --namespace-name $SB_NS --resource-group $RG_NAME --queue-name orders --name sender --query primaryKey -o tsv`


## Update Kubernetes manifest file

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Open the

`aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

file in a text editor.Remove the existing

`rabbitmq`

StatefulSet, ConfigMap, and Service sections and replace the existing`order-service`

Deployment section with the following content:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: order-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: order-service template: metadata: labels: app: order-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: order-service image: <REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/order-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 3000 env: - name: ORDER_QUEUE_HOSTNAME value: "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SB_NS_HOSTNAME>" # Example: sb-store-demo-123456.servicebus.windows.net - name: ORDER_QUEUE_PORT value: "5671" - name: ORDER_QUEUE_TRANSPORT value: "tls" - name: ORDER_QUEUE_USERNAME value: "sender" - name: ORDER_QUEUE_PASSWORD value: "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SB_SENDER_PASSWORD>" - name: ORDER_QUEUE_NAME value: "orders" - name: FASTIFY_ADDRESS value: "0.0.0.0" resources: requests: cpu: 1m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 75m memory: 128Mi startupProbe: httpGet: path: /health port: 3000 failureThreshold: 5 initialDelaySeconds: 20 periodSeconds: 10 readinessProbe: httpGet: path: /health port: 3000 failureThreshold: 3 initialDelaySeconds: 3 periodSeconds: 5 livenessProbe: httpGet: path: /health port: 3000 failureThreshold: 5 initialDelaySeconds: 3 periodSeconds: 3`

Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use

[Managed Identity](use-managed-identity)to authenticate with Azure Service Bus or store your secrets in[Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).Save and close the updated

`aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

file.

## Deploy the updated application

Deploy the updated application using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully updated resources:

`deployment.apps/order-service configured service/order-service unchanged deployment.apps/product-service unchanged service/product-service unchanged deployment.apps/store-front configured service/store-front unchanged`


## Test the application

### Place a sample order

Get the external IP address of the

`store-front`

service using the`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-front`

Navigate to the external IP address of the

`store-front`

service in your browser using`http://<external-ip>`

.Place an order by choosing a product and selecting

**Add to cart**.Select

**Cart**to view your order, and then select**Checkout**.

### View the order in the Azure Service Bus queue

- Navigate to the Azure portal and open the Azure Service Bus namespace you created earlier.
- Under
**Entities**, select**Queues**, and then select the**orders**queue. - In the
**orders**queue, select**Service Bus Explorer**. - Select
**Peek from start**to view the order you submitted.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you used Azure Service Bus to update and test the sample application. You learned how to:

- Create an Azure Service Bus namespace and queue.
- Update the Kubernetes manifest file to use the Azure Service Bus queue.
- Test the updated application by placing an order.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to scale an application in AKS.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes OS versions available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes, and best practices for testing and upgrading your OS version.

Caution

In this article, there are references to Ubuntu and Azure Linux OS versions that are being deprecated for AKS:

- Starting on
**March 17, 2027**, AKS will no longer support Ubuntu 20.04. Existing node images will be deleted and AKS will no longer provide security updates. You'll no longer be able to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by[upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster)to Kubernetes version 1.34+. For more information on this retirement, see[Retirement: Ubuntu 20.04 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874). - As of
**November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the[202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning**March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by[upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster)to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to[osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see[[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Supported OS versions

Each [node image](node-images) corresponds to an OS version, which you can specify using OS SKU. You can specify the following parameters when creating clusters and node pools:

**--os-type**: OS type, including Linux or Windows.*You can't specify the Windows OS type during cluster creation or update.***--os-sku**: Used to specify OS version or OS variant.*You can't specify the Windows OS SKU during cluster creation or update.*For more information for supported OS SKU options, see[Azure AKS CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)or[API](/en-us/rest/api/aks/agent-pools/create-or-update#ossku).**--kubernetes-version**: Version of Kubernetes to use for creating the node pool or cluster.


Best practice guidanceThe default OS version is the most recent validated version.


- For Ubuntu, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku Ubuntu`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Ubuntu version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Azure Linux, we recommend creating clusters and node pools while specifying
`--os-type Linux`

and`--os-sku AzureLinux`

. This will automatically update you to the latest default Azure Linux version based on your Kubernetes version.- For Windows, we recommend creating node pools while specifying
`--os-type Windows`

and`--os-sku Windows2022`

. You need to manually update node pools to the next OS version when it's released.

| OS type | OS SKU | Supported Kubernetes versions | Default versioning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | Ubuntu | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is default for Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2404 | This OS SKU will only be supported in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.38. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you want to migrate to the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. Ubuntu 24.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. |
| Linux | Ubuntu2204 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.36. | We recommend this versioned OS SKU if you need to roll back to Ubuntu 22.04. Ubuntu 22.04 is default when using `--os-sku Ubuntu` in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35. |
| Linux | AzureLinux | This OS SKU is supported in all Kubernetes versions. | OS version for this OS SKU changes based on your Kubernetes version. Azure Linux 2.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.27 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is default for Kubernetes version 1.32+. When the `AzureLinuxV3Preview` feature flag is enabled on AKS 1.31, `--os-sku AzureLinux` defaults to 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinux3 | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes 1.28 to 1.36. | We recommend this OS SKU if you want to test out the new OS version without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You can also use this OS SKU to migrate from Azure Linux 2.0 to Azure Linux 3.0. |
| Linux | AzureLinuxOSGuard | This OS SKU is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 and above. | Azure Linux with OS Guard versions are upgraded through node image upgrades. For more information, see
|

[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks).## Migrate to a new OS version

When a new OS version releases on AKS, it's initially supported in preview. After testing in preview for a few months, AKS makes the new OS version generally available (GA) and then updates the default OS SKU (`Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

) to the latest GA OS version. This default update occurs with a new Kubernetes version release.

We recommend testing your nonproduction workloads with the new OS version when it becomes available in preview. In order to access preview functions, make sure you have the preview extension installed. You can install the extension using the `az extension add --name aks-preview`

command.

There are two ways to migrate to a new OS version:

**Default OS SKU**: If you're using a default OS SKU such as`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

, you automatically get the latest GA version when you[upgrade your Kubernetes version](manage-node-pools). There are no manual changes required to migrate to a new OS version.**Versioned OS SKU**: If you're using a versioned OS SKU such as`Ubuntu2404`

,`AzureLinux3`

, or`Windows2025`

, you need to manually migrate to a new OS version to avoid blocked Kubernetes upgrades. If you're using a Linux OS, you can update the OS SKU on an existing node pool to manually migrate.

### Update OS SKU on an existing node pool

Update the `os-sku`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command. In cases where there's a new OS version available in preview, this functionality allows you to migrate your node pool to the new OS version without needing to upgrade your Kubernetes version.

Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Migrate to Ubuntu 24.04

Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for `--os-sku Ubuntu`

in Kubernetes versions 1.35+. You can also use Ubuntu 24.04 by specifying `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)is not supported.- Ubuntu 24.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.38.
- You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.39+.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

is an option and is intended for testing the new OS Linux version without requiring you to upgrade your Kubernetes version. - You need the preview Azure CLI version 18.0.0b5 or later for
*preview*and version 2.82.0 for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu2404`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2404 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


#### Migrate to Azure Linux 3.0

Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for `--os-sku AzureLinux`

in Kubernetes versions 1.32 to 1.36. You can also use Azure Linux 3.0 by specifying `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

.

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

:

`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.28 to 1.36.`--os-sku AzureLinux3`

is intended for migrating to Azure Linux 3.0 without upgrading your Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option before upgrading your Kubernetes version to 1.37+.- You need the Azure CLI version 18.0.0b36 or later for
*preview*and version 2.78.0 or later for*GA*installed and configured. To find your CLI version, run`az --version`

. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux3`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux3 \
--kubernetes-version 1.30.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


## Roll back your OS version

In Kubernetes versions where multiple OS versions are supported, you can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to roll back to a previous OS version.

You might want to roll back your OS version in the following scenarios:

- If you're testing a new OS version and you run into any issues.
- Once you upgrade to a Kubernetes version that supports the new OS version as default, you might want to roll back to the default
`Ubuntu`

or`AzureLinux`

OS SKU. This allows you to get future OS versions as a part of your Kubernetes upgrades instead of requiring a node pool update.

### Roll back your OS version to the default OS SKU

You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to update the

`os-sku`

on an existing node pool. In cases where there's a previous OS version supported in your Kubernetes version, this functionality can allow you to roll back your OS version.Note

The following values aren't supported for node pool update command:

`--os-sku Windows2019`

`--os-sku Windows2022`

`--os-sku Windows2025`


Instead, you need to add node pools to your cluster with the corresponding `--os-sku`

you intend to use.

| OS SKU | Default OS version |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu | When you have OS SKU `Ubuntu` , Ubuntu 22.04 is the default OS version if your Kubernetes version is 1.25 to 1.34. Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for Ubuntu in Kubernetes 1.35 to 1.37. |
| AzureLinux | When you have OS SKU `AzureLinux` , Azure Linux 2.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.26 to 1.31. Azure Linux 3.0 is the default for AzureLinux in Kubernetes 1.32 to 1.36. |

#### Update your OS SKU to Ubuntu on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `Ubuntu`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku Ubuntu`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


You can use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command to migrate between any supported Linux

`os-sku`

. The command might fail if the target OS doesn't have a supported node image for your Kubernetes version, VM size, or FIPS enablement.#### Update your OS SKU to Azure Linux on an existing node pool

When updating your node pool to use OS SKU `AzureLinux`

, you'll get the default OS version based on your Kubernetes version. This might trigger an automatic reimage if the OS version changes during the node pool update command.

Update to `--os-sku AzureLinux`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku AzureLinux \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```


### Roll back to Ubuntu 22.04

Note

Keep the following information in mind when migrating to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

:

[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[CVM](use-cvm)aren't supported.- Ubuntu 22.04 is supported in Kubernetes versions 1.25 to 1.35.
`--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

is intended for roll back to Ubuntu 22.04 on your current Kubernetes version. You need to update your OS SKU to a supported OS option to upgrade your Kubernetes version to 1.36 and above.

Roll back to `--os-sku Ubuntu2204`

on an existing node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command.

```
az aks nodepool update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--os-sku Ubuntu2204 \
--kubernetes-version 1.32.0 \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1
```

# Enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to enable or disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure CLI or Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

If you want to create a NAP-enabled AKS cluster with a custom virtual network (VNet) and subnets, see [Create a node auto-provisioning (NAP) cluster in a custom virtual network](node-auto-provisioning-custom-vnet).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, review the [Overview of node auto-provisioning (NAP) in AKS](node-auto-provisioning) article, which details [how NAP works](node-auto-provisioning#how-does-node-auto-provisioning-work), [prerequisites](node-auto-provisioning#prerequisites) and [limitations](node-auto-provisioning#limitations-and-unsupported-features).

## Enable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

The following sections explain how to enable NAP on a new or existing AKS cluster:

Note

You can enable [control plane metrics](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from [node auto-provisioning](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview).

### Enable NAP on a new cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

. The following command also sets the`--network-plugin`

to`azure`

,`--network-plugin-mode`

to`overlay`

, and`--network-dataplane`

to`cilium`

.`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Auto \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --network-dataplane cilium \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Create a file named

`nap.json`

and add the following ARM template configuration with the`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field set to`Auto`

, which enables NAP. (The default setting is`Manual`

.)`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Auto" } } } ] }`

Enable node auto-provisioning on a new cluster using the

command with the`az deployment group create`

`--template-file`

flag set to the path of the ARM template file.`az deployment group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --template-file ./nap.json`


### Enable NAP on an existing cluster

Enable node auto-provisioning on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Auto`

.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --node-provisioning-mode Auto`


## Disable node auto-provisioning (NAP) on an AKS cluster

Important

You can only disable NAP on a cluster if the following conditions are met:

- There are no existing NAP nodes. You can use the
`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command to check for existing NAP-managed nodes. - All existing Karpenter
have their`NodePools`

`spec.limits.cpu`

field set to`0`

. This action prevents new nodes from being created, but doesn't disrupt currently running nodes.

Set the

`spec.limits.cpu`

field to`0`

for every existing Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: limits: cpu: 0`

Important

If you don't want to ensure that every pod previously running on a NAP node is safely migrated to a non-NAP node before disabling NAP, you can skip steps 2 and 3 and instead use the

`kubectl delete node`

command for each NAP-managed node. However,**we don't recommend skipping these steps**, as it might leave some pods pending and doesn't honor Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs).When using the

`kubectl delete node`

command, be careful to only delete NAP-managed nodes. You can identify NAP-managed nodes using the`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command.Add the

`karpenter.azure.com/disable:NoSchedule`

taint to every Karpenter`NodePool`

. For example:`apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1 kind: NodePool metadata: name: default spec: template: spec: ... taints: - key: karpenter.azure.com/disable effect: NoSchedule`

This action starts the process of migrating the workloads on the NAP-managed nodes to non-NAP nodes, honoring PDBs and disruption limits. Pods migrate to non-NAP nodes if they can fit. If there isn't enough fixed-size capacity, some node NAP-managed nodes remain.

Scale up existing fixed-size

`ManagedCluster`

`AgentPools`

or create new fixed-size`AgentPools`

to take the load from the node NAP-managed nodes. As these nodes are added to the cluster, the node NAP-managed nodes are drained, and work is migrated to the fixed-size nodes.Delete all NAP-managed nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes -l karpenter.sh/nodepool`

command. If NAP-managed nodes still exist, the cluster likely lacks fixed-size capacity. In this case, you should add more nodes so the remaining workloads can be migrated.

Update the NAP mode to

`Manual`

using theAzure CLI command with the`az aks update`

`--node-provisioning-mode`

flag set to`Manual`

.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --node-provisioning-mode Manual`


Update the

`properties.nodeProvisioningProfile.mode`

field to`Manual`

in your ARM template and redeploy it.`{ "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#", "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0", "metadata": {}, "parameters": {}, "resources": [ { "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", "apiVersion": "2025-05-01", "sku": { "name": "Base", "tier": "Standard" }, "name": "napcluster", "location": "uksouth", "identity": { "type": "SystemAssigned" }, "properties": { "networkProfile": { "networkPlugin": "azure", "networkPluginMode": "overlay", "networkPolicy": "cilium", "networkDataplane":"cilium", "loadBalancerSku": "Standard" }, "dnsPrefix": "napcluster", "agentPoolProfiles": [ { "name": "agentpool", "count": 3, "vmSize": "standard_d2s_v3", "osType": "Linux", "mode": "System" } ], "nodeProvisioningProfile": { "mode": "Manual" } } } ] }`

Kubernetes includes security components, such as *pod security standards* and *Secrets*. Azure includes components like Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Containers, Azure Policy, Azure Key Vault, network security groups, and orchestrated cluster upgrades. AKS combines these security components to:

- Provide a complete authentication and authorization story.
- Apply AKS Built-in Azure Policy to secure your applications.
- End-to-End insight from build through your application with Microsoft Defender for Containers.
- Keep your AKS cluster running the latest OS security updates and Kubernetes releases.
- Provide secure pod traffic and access to sensitive credentials.

This article introduces the core concepts that secure your applications in AKS.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Build Security

As the entry point for the Supply Chain, it's important to conduct static analysis of image builds before they're promoted down the pipeline. This includes vulnerability and compliance assessment. It's not about failing a build because it has a vulnerability, as that breaks development. It's about looking at the **Vendor Status** to segment based on vulnerabilities that are actionable by the development teams. Also use **Grace Periods** to allow developers time to remediate identified issues.

## Registry Security

Assessing the vulnerability state of the image in the Registry detects drift and also catches images that didn't come from your build environment. Use [Notary V2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) to attach signatures to your images to ensure deployments are coming from a trusted location.

## Cluster security

In AKS, the Kubernetes master components are part of the managed service provided, managed, and maintained by Microsoft. Each AKS cluster has its own single-tenanted, dedicated Kubernetes master to provide the API Server, Scheduler, etc. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-vulnerability-management).

By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can limit access to the API server endpoint using [authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges). You can also create a fully [private cluster](private-clusters) to limit API server access to your virtual network.

You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) and Azure RBAC. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra integration with AKS](managed-azure-ad).

## Node security

AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines (VMs) that you manage and maintain.

- Linux nodes run optimized versions of Ubuntu or Azure Linux.
- Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server release using the
`containerd`

container runtime.

When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.

Note

AKS clusters running:

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher - Linux node pools use
`containerd`

as its container runtime. Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 node pools use`containerd`

as its container runtime. For more information, see[Add a Windows Server node pool with](create-node-pools).`containerd`

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and earlier - Linux node pools use Docker as its container runtime.

For more information about the security upgrade process for Linux and Windows worker nodes, see [Security patching nodes](concepts-vulnerability-management#worker-nodes).

AKS clusters running Azure Generation 2 VMs include support for [Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch). This feature protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques by combining technologies that you can enable independently, like secure boot and a virtualized version of the trusted platform module (vTPM). Administrators can deploy AKS worker nodes with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and drivers to ensure integrity of the entire boot chain of the underlying VM.

### Container and security optimized OS options

AKS released support for two new optimized Linux OS options. [Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/azure-linux-os-guard) is Microsoft-created and optimized for Azure. OS Guard is built on top of Azure Linux with specialized configuration to support containerized workloads with security optimizations. [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/flatcar) is a CNCF-based vendor-neutral container-optimized immutable OS, best suited for running on multicloud and on-premises environments. These OS options provide increased security when compared to other Linux OS options, such as:

- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS have an immutable operating system that you can't modify at runtime. All OS binaries, libraries and static configuration are read-only, and the bit-for-bit integrity is often cryptographically protected. These special purpose operating systems ship as self-contained images and come without any kind of package management or other traditional means of altering the OS. User workloads run in isolated environments like containers, sandboxed from the OS.
- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS use SELinux for Mandatory Access Control.
- Azure Linux OS Guard enforces
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch)enablement, providing improved compliance and protection against advanced and persistent attacks by combining secure boot and virtualized version of trusted platform module (vTPM).

When deciding between which container-optimized OS options to use, AKS recommends the following:

- Use
if you're looking for a vendor neutral immutable OS with cross-cloud support.**Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)** - Use
if you're looking for an enterprise-ready immutable OS, recommended by Microsoft.**Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)** - Use
[Ubuntu](https://aka.ms/aks/supported-ubuntu-versions)if you're looking for a vendor neutral, general purpose OS with cross-cloud support. - Use
[Azure Linux](https://aka.ms/aks/use-azure-linux)if you're looking for an enterprise-ready, general purpose OS, recommended by Microsoft.


### Node authorization

Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode that specifically authorizes kubelet API requests to protect against East-West attacks. Node authorization is enabled by default on AKS 1.24 + clusters.

### Node deployment

Nodes are deployed onto a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, SSH is enabled by default and only accessible using the internal IP address. Disabling SSH during cluster and node pool creation, or for an existing cluster or node pool, is in preview. See [Manage SSH access](manage-ssh-node-access) for more information.

### Node storage

To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, Azure Managed Disks are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, Azure Managed Disks are securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.

### Hostile multitenant workloads

Currently, Kubernetes environments aren't safe for hostile multitenant usage. Extra security features, like *Pod Security Policies* or Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multitenant workloads, only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node.

For these types of hostile multitenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters. For more information on ways to isolate workloads, see [Best practices for cluster isolation in AKS](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

### Compute isolation

Because of compliance or regulatory requirements, certain workloads may require a high degree of isolation from other customer workloads. For these workloads, Azure provides:

[Kernel isolated containers](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-containers)to use as the agent nodes in an AKS cluster. These containers are completely isolated to a specific hardware type and isolated from the Azure Host fabric, the host operating system, and the hypervisor. They're dedicated to a single customer. Select[one of the isolated VMs sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/isolation)as the**node size**when creating an AKS cluster or adding a node pool.[Confidential Containers](confidential-containers-overview)(preview), also based on Kata Confidential Containers, encrypts container memory and prevents data in memory during computation from being in clear text, readable format, and tampering. It helps isolate your containers from other container groups/pods, and VM node OS kernel. Confidential Containers (preview) uses hardware based memory encryption (SEV-SNP).[Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing)(preview) provides an isolation boundary between the container application and the shared kernel and compute resources (CPU, memory, and network) of the container host.

## Network security

For connectivity and security with on-premises networks, you can deploy your AKS cluster into existing Azure virtual network subnets. These virtual networks connect back to your on-premises network using Azure Site-to-Site VPN or Express Route. Define Kubernetes ingress controllers with private, internal IP addresses to limit services access to the internal network connection.

### Azure network security groups

To filter virtual network traffic flow, Azure uses network security group rules. These rules define the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols allowed or denied access to resources. Default rules are created to allow TLS traffic to the Kubernetes API server. You create services with load balancers, port mappings, or ingress routes. AKS automatically modifies the network security group for traffic flow.

If you provide your own subnet for your AKS cluster (whether using Azure CNI or Kubenet), **do not** modify the NIC-level network security group managed by AKS. Instead, create more subnet-level network security groups to modify the flow of traffic. Make sure they don't interfere with necessary traffic managing the cluster, such as load balancer access, communication with the control plane, or [egress](limit-egress-traffic).

### Kubernetes network policy

To limit network traffic between pods in your cluster, AKS offers support for [Kubernetes network policies](use-network-policies). With network policies, you can allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors.

## Application Security

To protect pods running on AKS, consider [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction) to detect and restrict cyber attacks against your applications running in your pods. Run continual scanning to detect drift in the vulnerability state of your application and implement a "blue/green/canary" process to patch and replace the vulnerable images.

## Secure container access to resources

In the same way that you should grant users or groups the minimum privileges required, you should also limit containers to only necessary actions and processes. To minimize the risk of attack, avoid configuring applications and containers that require escalated privileges or root access. Built-in Linux security features such as *AppArmor* and *seccomp* are recommended as [best practices](/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security) to [secure container access to resources][secure-container-access].

## Kubernetes Secrets

With a Kubernetes *Secret*, you inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys.

- Create a Secret using the Kubernetes API.
- Define your pod or deployment and request a specific Secret.
- Secrets are only provided to nodes with a scheduled pod that requires them.
- The Secret is stored in
*tmpfs*, not written to disk.

- When you delete the last pod on a node requiring a Secret, the Secret is deleted from the node's
*tmpfs*.- Secrets are stored within a given namespace and are only accessible from pods within the same namespace.


Using Secrets reduces the sensitive information defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret.

Note

The raw secret manifest files contain the secret data in base64 format. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). Treat these files as sensitive information, and never commit them to source control.

Kubernetes secrets are stored in *etcd*, a distributed key-value store. AKS allows [encryption at rest of secrets in etcd using customer managed keys](use-kms-etcd-encryption).

# Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in AKS, you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects issues, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demands. It also regularly checks nodes for a lack of running pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article shows you how to enable and manage the cluster autoscaler in AKS, which is based on the [open-source Kubernetes version](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).

## Before you begin

This article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Use the cluster autoscaler on an AKS cluster

Important

The cluster autoscaler is a Kubernetes component. Although the AKS cluster uses a virtual machine scale set for the nodes, don't manually enable or edit settings for scale set autoscaling. Let the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler manage the required scale settings. For more information, see [Can I modify the AKS resources in the node resource group?](faq)

### Enable the cluster autoscaler on a new cluster

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster using the`az aks create`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command creates a cluster with a single node backed by a virtual machine scale set, enables the cluster autoscaler, sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster

Update an existing cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool using the`az aks update`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command updates an existing AKS cluster to enable the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster and sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to update the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

Disable the cluster autoscaler using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`

Nodes aren't removed when the cluster autoscaler is disabled.


Note

You can manually scale your cluster after disabling the cluster autoscaler using the [ az aks scale](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-scale) command. If you use the horizontal pod autoscaler, it continues to run with the cluster autoscaler disabled, but pods might end up unable to be scheduled if all node resources are in use.

### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.## Use the cluster autoscaler on node pools

### Use the cluster autoscaler on multiple node pools

You can use the cluster autoscaler with [multiple node pools](create-node-pools) and can enable the cluster autoscaler on each individual node pool and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Update the settings on an existing node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the

command and the`az aks nodepool update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`


### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview#enable-cluster-auto-scaler-for-a-node-pool) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.Note

If you plan on using the cluster autoscaler with node pools that span multiple zones and leverage scheduling features related to zones, such as volume topological scheduling, we recommend you have one node pool per zone and enable `--balance-similar-node-groups`

through the autoscaler profile. This ensures the autoscaler can successfully scale up and keep the sizes of the node pools balanced.

## Update the cluster autoscaler settings

As your application demands change, you might need to adjust the cluster autoscaler node count to scale efficiently.

Change the node count using the

command and update the cluster autoscaler using the`az aks update`

`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying your updated node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

The cluster autoscaler enforces the minimum count in cases where the actual count drops below the minimum due to external factors, such as during a spot eviction or when changing the minimum count value from the AKS API.

## Use the cluster autoscaler profile

You can configure more granular details of the cluster autoscaler by changing the default values in the cluster-wide autoscaler profile. For example, a scale down event happens after nodes are under-utilized after 10 minutes. If you have workloads that run every 15 minutes, you might want to change the autoscaler profile to scale down under-utilized nodes after 15 or 20 minutes. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, a default profile is used unless you specify different settings.

Important

The cluster autoscaler profile affects **all node pools** that use the cluster autoscaler. You can't set an autoscaler profile per node pool. When you set the profile, any existing node pools with the cluster autoscaler enabled immediately start using the profile.

### Cluster autoscaler profile settings

The following table lists the available settings for the cluster autoscaler profile:

| Setting | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`scan-interval` |
How often the cluster is reevaluated for scale up or down. | 10 seconds |
`scale-down-delay-after-add` |
How long after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-delay-after-delete` |
How long after node deletion that scale down evaluation resumes. | `scan-interval` |
`scale-down-delay-after-failure` |
How long after scale down failure that scale down evaluation resumes. | Three minutes |
`scale-down-unneeded-time` |
How long a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-unready-time` |
How long an unready node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 20 minutes |

Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from empty nodes. | `false` |
`daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from non-empty nodes. | `true` |
`scale-down-utilization-threshold` |
The maximum value between the sum of CPU requests and sum of Memory requests of all pods running on the node divided by node's corresponding allocatable resource, below which a node can be considered for scale down. | 0.5 |
`max-graceful-termination-sec` |
Maximum number of seconds the cluster autoscaler waits for pod termination when trying to scale down a node. | 600 seconds |
`balance-similar-node-groups` |
Detects similar node pools and balances the number of nodes between them. | `false` |
`expander` |
Type of node pool
`most-pods` , `random` , `least-waste` , and `priority` . |

`random`

`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods with local storage, for example, EmptyDir or HostPath.`false`

`skip-nodes-with-system-pods`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods from kube-system (except for DaemonSet or mirror pods).`true`

`max-empty-bulk-delete`

`new-pod-scale-up-delay`

`max-total-unready-percentage`

`max-node-provision-time`

`ok-total-unready-count`

Note

The ignore-daemonsets-utilization, daemonset-eviction-for-empty-nodes, and daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes parameters are GA from API version 2024-05-01. If you are using the CLI to update these flags, please ensure you are using version 2.63 or later.

### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on a new cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and set the cluster autoscaler profile using the`az aks create`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on an existing cluster

Set the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the

command and the`az aks update`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter. The following example configures the scan interval setting as*30s*:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s`


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for aggressive scale down

Note

Scaling down aggressively is not recommended for clusters experiencing frequent scale-outs and scale-ins within short intervals, as it could potentially result in extended node provisioning times under these circumstances. Increasing `scale-down-delay-after-add`

can help in these circumstances by keeping the node around longer to handle incoming workloads.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s,scale-down-delay-after-add=0m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=3m,scale-down-unready-time=3m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=1000,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for bursty workloads

```
az aks update \
--resource-group "myResourceGroup" \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=20s,scale-down-delay-after-add=10m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=5m,scale-down-unready-time=5m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=100,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Reset cluster autoscaler profile to default values

Reset the cluster autoscaler profile using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile ""`


## Retrieve cluster autoscaler logs and status

You can retrieve logs and status updates from the cluster autoscaler to help diagnose and debug autoscaler events. AKS manages the cluster autoscaler on your behalf and runs it in the managed control plane. You can enable control plane node to see the logs and operations from the cluster autoscaler.

Set up a rule for resource logs to push cluster autoscaler logs to Log Analytics using the

[instructions here](monitor-aks#aks-control-plane-resource-logs). Make sure you check the box for`cluster-autoscaler`

when selecting options for**Logs**.Select the

**Log**section on your cluster.Enter the following example query into Log Analytics:

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "cluster-autoscaler"`

View cluster autoscaler scale-up not triggered events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,reason=NotTriggerScaleUp`

View cluster autoscaler warning events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,type=Warning`

The cluster autoscaler also writes out the health status to a

`configmap`

named`cluster-autoscaler-status`

. You can retrieve these logs using the following`kubectl`

command:`kubectl get configmap -n kube-system cluster-autoscaler-status -o yaml`


For more information, see the [Kubernetes/autoscaler GitHub project FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#ca-doesnt-work-but-it-used-to-work-yesterday-why).

## Cluster Autoscaler Metrics

You can enable [control plane metrics (Preview)](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from the [cluster autoscaler](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)

## Next steps

This article showed you how to automatically scale the number of AKS nodes. You can also use the horizontal pod autoscaler to automatically adjust the number of pods that run your application. For steps on using the horizontal pod autoscaler, see [Scale applications in AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-scale).

To further help improve cluster resource utilization and free up CPU and memory for other pods, see [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler).
