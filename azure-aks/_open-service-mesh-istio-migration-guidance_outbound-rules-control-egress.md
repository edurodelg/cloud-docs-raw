Important

This article aims to provide a simplistic understanding of how to identify OSM configurations and translate them to equivalent Istio configurations for migrating workloads from OSM to Istio. This by no means, is considered to be an exhaustive detailed guide.

This article provides practical guidance for mapping OSM policies to the [Istio](https://istio.io/) policies to help migrate your microservices deployments managed by OSM over to being managed by Istio. We utilize the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) as a base reference for current OSM users. The following walk-through deploys the Bookstore application. The same steps are followed and explain how to apply the OSM [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) traffic policies using the Istio equivalent.

If you are not using OSM and are new to Istio, start with [Istio's own Getting Started guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/) to learn how to use the Istio service mesh for your applications. If you are currently using OSM, make sure you are familiar with the OSM [Bookstore sample application](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) walk-through on how OSM configures traffic policies. The following walk-through does not duplicate the current documentation, and reference specific topics when relevant. You should be comfortable and fully aware of the bookstore application architecture before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- The OSM AKS add-on is uninstalled from your AKS cluster
- Any existing OSM Bookstore application, including namespaces, is uninstalled and deleted from your cluster
[Install the Istio AKS service mesh add-on](istio-deploy-addon)

## Modifications needed to the OSM Sample Bookstore Application

To allow for Istio to manage the OSM bookstore application, there are a couple of changes needed in the existing manifests. Those changes are with the bookstore and the mysql services.

### Bookstore Modifications

In the OSM Bookstore walk-through, the bookstore service is deployed along with another bookstore-v2 service to demonstrate how OSM provides traffic shifting. This deployed services allowed you to split the client (`bookbuyer`

) traffic between multiple service endpoints. The first new concept to understand how Istio handles what they refer to as [Traffic Shifting](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/).

OSM implementation of traffic shifting is based on the [SMI Traffic Split specification](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha4/traffic-split.md). The SMI Traffic Split specification requires the existence of multiple top-level services that are added as backends with the desired weight metric to shift client requests from one service to another. Istio accomplishes traffic shifting using a combination of a [Virtual Service](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) and a [Destination Rule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/). It is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with both the concepts of a virtual service and destination rule.

Put simply, the Istio virtual service defines routing rules for clients that request the host (service name). Virtual Services allows for multiple versions of a deployment to be associated to one virtual service hostname for clients to target. Multiple deployments can be labeled for the same service, representing different versions of the application behind the same hostname. The Istio virtual service can then be configured to weight the request to a specific version of the service. The available versions of the service are configured to use the `subsets`

attribute in an Istio destination rule.

The modification made to the bookstore service and deployment for Istio removes the need to have an explicit second service to target, which the SMI Traffic Split needs. There's no need for another service account for the bookstore v2 service as well, since it's to be consolidated under the bookstore service. The original OSM [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest modification to Istio for both the bookstore v1 and v2 are shown in the below [Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts](#create-pods-services-and-service-accounts) section. We demonstrate how we do traffic splitting, known as traffic shifting later in the walk-through:

### MySql Modifications

Changes to the mysql stateful set are only needed in the service configuration. Under the service specification, OSM needed the `targetPort`

and `appProtocol`

attributes. These attributes are not needed for Istio. The following updated service for the mysqldb looks like:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: mysqldb
labels:
app: mysqldb
service: mysqldb
spec:
ports:
- port: 3306
name: tcp
selector:
app: mysqldb
```


## Deploy the Modified Bookstore Application

Similar to the OSM Bookstore walk-through, we start with a new install of the bookstore application.

### Create the Namespaces

```
kubectl create namespace bookstore
kubectl create namespace bookbuyer
kubectl create namespace bookthief
kubectl create namespace bookwarehouse
```


### Add a namespace label for Istio sidecar injection

For OSM, using the command `osm namespace add <namespace>`

created the necessary annotations to the namespace for the OSM controller to add automatic sidecar injection. With Istio, you only need to just label a namespace to allow the Istio controller to be instructed to automatically inject the Envoy sidecar proxies.

```
kubectl label namespace bookstore istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookbuyer istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookthief istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace bookwarehouse istio-injection=enabled
```


### Deploy the Istio Virtual Service and Destination Rule for Bookstore

As mentioned earlier in the Bookstore Modification section, Istio handles traffic shifting utilizing a VirtualService weight attribute we configure later in the walk-through. We deploy the virtual service and destination rule for the bookstore service. We deploy only the bookstore version 1 even though the bookstore version 2 is deployed. The Istio virtual service is only supplying a route to the version 1 of bookstore. Different from how OSM handles traffic shifting (traffic split), OSM deployed another service for the bookstore version 2 application. OSM needed to set up traffic to be split between client requests using a TrafficSplit. When using traffic shifting with Istio, we can reference shifting traffic to multiple Kubernetes application deployments (versions) labeled for the same service.

In this walk-though, the deployment of both bookstore versions (v1 & v2) is deployed at the same time. Only the version 1 is reachable due to the virtual service configuration. There is no need to deploy another service for bookstore version 2, we enable a route to the bookstore version 2 later when we update the bookstore virtual service and provide the necessary weight attribute to do traffic shifting.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service

EOF
```


### Create Pods, Services, and Service Accounts

We use a single manifest file that contains the modifications discussed earlier in the walk-through to deploy the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, `bookwarehouse`

, and `mysql`

applications.

kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookstore
kubectl get pods,deployments,serviceaccounts,services,endpoints -n bookwarehouse
```


### View the Application UIs

Similar to the original OSM walk-through, if you have the OSM repo cloned you can utilize the port forwarding scripts to view the UIs of each application [here](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/#view-the-application-uis). For now, we are only concerned to view the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

UI.

```
cp .env.example .env
bash <<EOF
./scripts/port-forward-bookbuyer-ui.sh &
./scripts/port-forward-bookthief-ui.sh &
wait
EOF
```


In a browser, open up the following urls:

http://localhost:8080 - bookbuyer

http://localhost:8083 - bookthief

## Configure Istio's Traffic Policies

To maintain continuity with the original OSM Bookstore walk-through for the translation to Istio, we discuss [OSM's Permissive Traffic Policy Mode](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/traffic_policies/#permissive-traffic-policy-mode). OSM's permissive traffic policy mode was a concept of allowing or denying traffic in the mesh without any specific [SMI Traffic Access Control rule](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/main/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha3/traffic-access.md) deployed. The permissive traffic mode configuration existed to allow users to onboard applications into the mesh, while gaining mTLS encryption, without requiring explicit rules to allow applications in the mesh to communicate. The permissive traffic mode feature was to avoid breaking the communications of your application as soon as OSM managed it, and provide time to define your rules while ensuring that application communications was mTLS encrypted. This setting could be set to `true`

or `false`

via OSM's MeshConfig.

Istio handles mTLS enforcement differently. Different from OSM, Istio's permissive mode automatically configures sidecar proxies to use mTLS but allow the service to accept both plaintext and mTLS traffic. The equivalent to OSM's permissive mode configuration is to utilize Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

settings. `PeerAuthentication`

can be done granularly at the namespace or for the entire mesh. For more information on Istio's enforcement of mTLS, read the [Istio Mutual TLS Migration article](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/).

### Enforce Istio Strict Mode on Bookstore Namespaces

It is important to remember, just like OSM's permissive mode, Istio's `PeerAuthentication`

configuration is only related to the use of mTLS enforcement. Actual layer-7 policies, much like those used in OSM's HTTPRouteGroups, is handled using Istio's AuthorizationPolicy configurations you see later in the walk-through.

We granularly put the `bookbuyer`

, `bookthief`

, `bookstore`

, and `bookwarehouse`

namespaces in Istio's mTLS strict mode.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookthief
namespace: bookthief
spec:

---

---
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
name: bookwarehouse
namespace: bookwarehouse
spec:
mtls:
mode: STRICT
EOF
```


### Deploy Istio Access Control Policies

Similar to OSM's [SMI Traffic Target](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha2/traffic-access.md) and [SMI Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/v0.6.0/apis/traffic-specs/v1alpha4/traffic-specs.md) resources to define access control and routing policies for the applications to communicate, Istio accomplishes these similar fine-grain controls by using `AuthorizationPolicy`

configurations.

Let's walk through translating the bookstore TrafficTarget policy, which specifically allows the `bookbuyer`

to communicate to it, with only certain layer-7 path, headers, and methods. The following is a portion of the [traffic-access-v1.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/release-v1.2/manifests/access/traffic-access-v1.yaml) manifest.

```
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
destination:
kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
rules:
- kind: HTTPRouteGroup
name: bookstore-service-routes
matches:
- buy-a-book
- books-bought
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
name: bookbuyer
namespace: bookbuyer
---
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


If you notice under the TrafficTarget policy, in the spec is where you can explicitly define what source service can communicate with a destination service. We can see that we are allowing the source `bookbuyer`

to be authorized to communicate to the destination bookstore. If we translate the service-to-service authorization from an OSM `TrafficTarget`

configuration to an Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

, it looks like this below:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
name: bookstore
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
```


In the Istio's `AuthorizationPolicy`

, you notice how the OSM TrafficTarget policy destination service is mapped to the selector label match and the namespace the service resides in. The source service is shown under the rules section where there is a source/principles attribute that maps to the service account name for the `bookbuyer`

service.

In addition to just the source/destination configuration in the OSM TrafficTarget, OSM binds the use of an HTTPRouteGroup to further define the layer-7 authorization the source has access to. We can see in just the portion of the HTTPRouteGroup below. There are two `matches`

for the allowed source service.

```
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha4
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
name: bookstore-service-routes
namespace: bookstore
spec:
matches:
- name: books-bought
pathRegex: /books-bought
methods:
- GET
headers:
- "user-agent": ".*-http-client/*.*"
- "client-app": "bookbuyer"
- name: buy-a-book
pathRegex: ".*a-book.*new"
methods:
- GET
```


There is a `match`

named `books-bought`

that allows the source to access path `/books-bought`

using a `GET`

method with host header user-agent and client-app information, and a `buy-a-book`

match that uses a regex express for a path containing `.*a-book.*new`

using a `GET`

method.

We can define these OSM HTTPRouteGroup configurations in the rules section of the Istio `AuthorizationPolicy`

shown below:

```
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "AuthorizationPolicy"
metadata:
name: "bookstore"
namespace: bookstore
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: bookstore
action: ALLOW
rules:
- from:
- source:
principals: ["cluster.local/ns/bookbuyer/sa/bookbuyer"]
- source:
namespaces: ["bookbuyer"]
to:
- operation:
methods: ["GET"]
paths: ["*/books-bought", "*/buy-a-book/new"]
- when:
- key: request.headers[User-Agent]
values: ["*-http-client/*"]
- key: request.headers[Client-App]
values: ["bookbuyer"]
```


We can now deploy the OSM migrated traffic-access-v1.yaml manifest as understood by Istio below. There is not an `AuthorizationPolicy`

for the bookthief, so the bookthief UI should stop incrementing books from bookstore v1:

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

```


### Allowing the Bookthief Application to access Bookstore

Currently there is no `AuthorizationPolicy`

that allows for the bookthief to communicate with bookstore. We can deploy the following `AuthorizationPolicy`

to allow the bookthief to communicate to the bookstore. You notice the addition for the rule for the bookstore policy that allows the bookthief authorization.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF

```


The bookthief UI should now be incrementing books from bookstore v1.

## Configure Traffic Shifting between two Service Versions

To demonstrate how to balance traffic between two versions of a Kubernetes service, known as traffic shifting in Istio. As you recall in a previous section, OSM implementation of traffic shifting relied on two distinct services being deployed and adding those service names to the backend configuration of the `TrafficTarget`

policy. This deployment architecture is not needed for how Istio implements traffic shifting. With Istio, we can create multiple deployments that represent each version of the service application and shift traffic to those specific versions via the Istio `virtualservice`

configuration.

The currently deployed `virtualservice`

only has a route rule to the v1 version of the bookstore shown below:

```
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
```


We update the `virtualservice`

to shift 100% of the weight to the v2 version of the bookstore.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
# Create bookstore virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: bookstore-virtualservice
namespace: bookstore
spec:
hosts:
- bookstore
http:
- route:
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v1
weight: 0
- destination:
host: bookstore
subset: v2
weight: 100
EOF
```


You should now see both the `bookbuyer`

and `bookthief`

# Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides the necessary details that allow you to secure outbound traffic from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It contains the cluster requirements for a base AKS deployment and additional requirements for optional addons and features. You can apply this information to any outbound restriction method or appliance.

To see an example configuration using Azure Firewall, visit [Control egress traffic using Azure Firewall in AKS](limit-egress-traffic).

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Background

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network. This network can either be customized and preconfigured by you or it can be created and managed by AKS. In either case, the cluster has **outbound**, or egress, dependencies on services outside of the virtual network.

For management and operational purposes, nodes in an AKS cluster need to access certain ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). These endpoints are required for the nodes to communicate with the API server or to download and install core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates. For example, the cluster needs to pull container images from Microsoft Artifact Registry (MAR).

The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means you can't use network security groups (NSGs) to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound internet access. This level of network access allows nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. For outbound internet traffic, it's not recommended to set all deny rules in an NSG.

A [network isolated AKS cluster](concepts-network-isolated), provides the simplest and most secure solution for setting up outbound restrictions for a cluster out of the box. A network isolated cluster pulls the images for cluster components and add-ons from a private Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance connected to the cluster instead of pulling from MAR. If the images aren't present, the private ACR pulls them from MAR and serves them via its private endpoint, eliminating the need to enable egress from the cluster to the public MAR endpoint. The cluster operator can then incrementally set up allowed outbound traffic securely over a private network for each scenario they want to enable. This way the cluster operators have complete control over designing the allowed outbound traffic from their clusters right from the start, thus allowing them to reduce the risk of data exfiltration.

Another solution to securing outbound addresses is using a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination. You can also configure your preferred firewall and security rules to allow these required ports and addresses.

Important

This document covers only how to lock down the traffic leaving the AKS subnet. AKS has no ingress requirements by default. Blocking **internal subnet traffic** using network security groups (NSGs) and firewalls isn't supported. To control and block the traffic within the cluster, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS](use-network-policies).

## Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters

The following network and FQDN/application rules are required for an AKS cluster. You can use them if you wish to configure a solution other than Azure Firewall.

- IP address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic).
- FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
- Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your AKS cluster based on a number of qualifiers.
- AKS uses an admission controller to inject the FQDN as an environment variable to all deployments under kube-system and gatekeeper-system. This ensures all system communication between nodes and API server uses the API server FQDN and not the API server IP. You can get the same behavior on your own pods, in any namespace, by annotating the pod spec with an annotation named
`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

. If that annotation is present, AKS will set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This is useful in cases where the cluster egress is via a layer 7 firewall. - If you have an app or solution that needs to talk to the API server, you must either add an
**additional**network rule to allow**TCP communication to port 443 of your API server's IP****OR**, if you have a layer 7 firewall configured to allow traffic to the API Server's domain name, set`kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`

in your pod specs. - On rare occasions, if there's a maintenance operation, your API server IP might change. Planned maintenance operations that can change the API server IP are always communicated in advance.
- You might notice traffic towards "md-*.blob.storage.azure.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used for internal components of Azure Managed Disks. Blocking access to this endpoint from your firewall should not cause any issues.
- You might notice traffic towards "umsa*.blob.core.windows.net" endpoint. This endpoint is used to store manifests for Azure Linux VM Agent & Extensions and is regularly checked to download new versions. You can find more details on
[VM Extensions](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/features-linux?tabs=azure-cli#network-access).
