Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this tutorial, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker`

commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) system.

Note

Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Use

[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)to clone the sample application to your development environment.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git`

Change into the cloned directory.

`cd aks-store-demo`


## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [ docker-compose-quickstart YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the

[repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main)you cloned.

```


## Create container images and run application

You can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the

`docker compose`

command:`docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d`

View the created images using the

command.`docker images`

`docker images`

The following condensed example output shows the created images:

`REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID aks-store-demo-product-service latest 72f5cd7e6b84 aks-store-demo-order-service latest 54ad5de546f9 aks-store-demo-store-front latest 1125f85632ae ...`

View the running containers using the

command.`docker ps`

`docker ps`

The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

`CONTAINER ID IMAGE f27fe74cfd0a aks-store-demo-product-service df1eaa137885 aks-store-demo-order-service b3ce9e496e96 aks-store-demo-store-front 31df28627ffa rabbitmq:3.13.2-management-alpine`


## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. * Do not delete the container images* - you use them in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

command.`docker-compose down`

`docker compose down`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created a sample application, created container images for the application, and then tested the application. You learned how to:

- Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
- Create a container image from the sample application source.
- Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.

# Simplified application autoscaling with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) is a single-purpose and lightweight component that strives to make application autoscaling simple and is a Cloud Native Computing Federation (CNCF) Graduate project.

It applies event-driven autoscaling to scale your application to meet demand in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner with scale-to-zero.

The KEDA add-on makes it even easier by deploying a managed KEDA installation, providing you with [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) that you can scale your applications with on your Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster.

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.32.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Architecture

[KEDA](https://keda.sh/) provides two main components:

**KEDA operator**allows end-users to scale workloads in or out from 0 to N instances with support for Kubernetes Deployments, Jobs,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource.**Metrics server**exposes external metrics to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in Kubernetes for autoscaling purposes such as messages in a Kafka topic, or number of events in an Azure event hub. Due to upstream limitations, KEDA must be the only installed external metric adapter.


Learn more about how KEDA works in the [official KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/concepts/).

## Installation

KEDA can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the KEDA add-on using an [ARM template](keda-deploy-add-on-arm) or [Azure CLI](keda-deploy-add-on-cli).

The KEDA add-on provides a fully supported installation of KEDA that is integrated with AKS.

## Capabilities and features

KEDA provides the following capabilities and features:

- Build sustainable and cost-efficient applications with scale-to-zero
- Scale application workloads to meet demand using
[a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) - Autoscale applications with
`ScaledObjects`

, such as Deployments,`StatefulSets`

, or any custom resource that defines`/scale`

subresource - Autoscale job-like workloads with
`ScaledJobs`

- Use production-grade security by decoupling autoscaling authentication from workloads
- Bring-your-own external scaler to use tailor-made autoscaling decisions
- Integrate with
[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](workload-identity-overview)for authentication

Note

If you plan to use workload identity, [enable the workload identity add-on](workload-identity-deploy-cluster) before enabling the KEDA add-on.

## Add-on limitations

The KEDA AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- KEDA's
[HTTP add-on (preview)](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on)to scale HTTP workloads isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - KEDA's
[external scaler for Azure Cosmos DB](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)to scale based on Azure Cosmos DB change feed isn't installed with the extension, but can be deployed separately. - Only one external metric server is allowed in the Kubernetes cluster. Because of that the KEDA add-on should be the only external metrics server inside the cluster.
- Multiple KEDA installations aren't supported

- It's not recommended to combine KEDA's
`ScaledObject`

with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the same workload. They compete with each other because KEDA uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in the background and results in odd scaling behavior.- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created and the KEDA`ScaledObject`

would fail to be created. - If a KEDA
`ScaledObject`

is created first and then an HPA is created, the HPA creation isn't blocked.

- If an HPA is created first, then a KEDA

For general KEDA questions, we recommend [visiting the FAQ overview](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/reference/faq/).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Supported Kubernetes and KEDA versions

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version is installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:
