# Install the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on using the Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

This article shows you how to install the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure CLI.

Important

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines what KEDA version will be installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.31.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, please read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, please read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - You need the
[Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - Ensure you have firewall rules configured to allow access to the Kubernetes API server. For more information, see
[Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](outbound-rules-control-egress#azure-global-required-network-rules).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Install the KEDA add-on with Azure CLI

To install the KEDA add-on, use `--enable-keda`

when creating or updating a cluster.

## Enable the KEDA add-on on your AKS cluster

Note

While KEDA provides various customization options, the KEDA add-on currently provides basic common configuration.

If you require custom configurations, you can manually edit the KEDA YAML files to customize the installation. **Azure doesn't offer support for custom configurations**.

### Create a new AKS cluster with KEDA add-on enabled

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create a new AKS cluster using the

command and enable the KEDA add-on using the`az aks create`

`--enable-keda`

flag.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-keda \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable the KEDA add-on on an existing AKS cluster

Update an existing cluster using the

command and enable the KEDA add-on using the`az aks update`

`--enable-keda`

flag.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-keda`


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


## Verify the KEDA add-on is installed on your cluster

Verify the KEDA add-on is installed on your cluster using the

command and set the`az aks show`

`--query`

parameter to`workloadAutoScalerProfile.keda.enabled`

.`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query "workloadAutoScalerProfile.keda.enabled"`

The following example output shows the KEDA add-on is installed on the cluster:

`true`


## Verify KEDA is running on your cluster

Verify the KEDA add-on is running on your cluster using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -n kube-system`

The following example output shows the KEDA operator, admissions hook, and metrics API server are installed on the cluster:

`keda-admission-webhooks-**********-2n9zl 1/1 Running 0 3d18h keda-admission-webhooks-**********-69dkg 1/1 Running 0 3d18h keda-operator-*********-4hb5n 1/1 Running 0 3d18h keda-operator-*********-pckpx 1/1 Running 0 3d18h keda-operator-metrics-apiserver-**********-gqg4s 1/1 Running 0 3d18h keda-operator-metrics-apiserver-**********-trfcb 1/1 Running 0 3d18h`


## Verify the KEDA version on your cluster

To verify the version of your KEDA, use `kubectl get crd/scaledobjects.keda.sh -o yaml `

. For example:

```
kubectl get crd/scaledobjects.keda.sh -o yaml
```


The following example output shows the configuration of KEDA in the `app.kubernetes.io/version`

# Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Kubernetes. By adopting and using CSI, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can write, deploy, and iterate plug-ins to expose new or improve existing storage systems in Kubernetes without having to touch the core Kubernetes code and wait for its release cycles.

The CSI storage driver support on AKS allows you to natively use:

can be used to create a Kubernetes**Azure Disks***DataDisk*resource. Disks can use Azure Premium Storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard Storage, backed by regular HDDs or Standard SSDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium Storage. Azure Disks are mounted as*ReadWriteOnce*and are only available to one node in AKS. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple nodes simultaneously, use Azure Files.can be used to mount an SMB 3.0/3.1 share backed by an Azure storage account to pods. With Azure Files, you can share data across multiple nodes and pods. Azure Files can use Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs or Azure Premium storage backed by high-performance SSDs.**Azure Files**can be used to mount Blob storage (or object storage) as a file system into a container or pod. Using Blob storage enables your cluster to support applications that work with large unstructured datasets like log file data, images or documents, HPC, and others. Additionally, if you ingest data into**Azure Blob storage**[Azure Data Lake storage](/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction), you can directly mount and use it in AKS without configuring another interim filesystem.

Tip

If you want a fully managed solution for block-level access to data, consider using [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction) instead of CSI drivers. Azure Container Storage integrates with Kubernetes, allowing dynamic and automatic provisioning of persistent volumes. Azure Container Storage supports Azure Disks, Ephemeral Disks, and Azure Elastic SAN (preview) as backing storage, offering flexibility and scalability for stateful applications running on Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.42 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If the open-source CSI storage driver is installed on your cluster, uninstall it before enabling the Azure storage CSI driver.
- To enforce the Azure Policy for AKS
[policy definition](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#kubernetes)**Kubernetes clusters should use Container Storage Interface(CSI) driver StorageClass**, the Azure Policy add-on needs to be enabled on new and existing clusters. For an existing cluster, review the[Learn Azure Policy for Kubernetes](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes)to enable it.

## Disk encryption supported scenarios

CSI storage drivers support the following scenarios:

[Encrypted managed disks with customer-managed keys](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-cross-tenant-customer-managed-keys)using Azure Key Vaults stored in a different Microsoft Entra tenant.- Encrypt your Azure Storage disks hosting AKS OS and application data with
[customer-managed keys](azure-disk-customer-managed-keys).

## Enable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster

To enable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--enable-disk-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--enable-file-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--enable-blob-driver`

allows you to enable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--enable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to enable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --enable-disk-driver --enable-file-driver --enable-blob-driver --enable-snapshot-controller
```


It might take several minutes to complete this action. Once it's complete, you should see in the output the status of enabling the driver on your cluster. The following example resembles the section indicating the results when enabling the Blob storage CSI driver:

```
"storageProfile": {
"blobCsiDriver": {
"enabled": true
},
```


## Disable CSI storage drivers on a new or existing cluster

To disable CSI storage drivers on a new cluster, include one of the following parameters depending on the storage system:

`--disable-disk-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Disks CSI driver](azure-disk-csi).`--disable-file-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Files CSI driver](azure-files-csi).`--disable-blob-driver`

allows you to disable the[Azure Blob storage CSI driver](azure-blob-csi).`--disable-snapshot-controller`

allows you to disable the[snapshot controller](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/snapshot-controller.html).

```
az aks create \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


To disable CSI storage drivers on an existing cluster, use one of the parameters listed earlier depending on the storage system:

```
az aks update \
--name myAKSCluster \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--disable-disk-driver \
--disable-file-driver \
--disable-blob-driver \
--disable-snapshot-controller
```


Note

We recommend deleting the corresponding PersistentVolumeClaim object instead of the PersistentVolume object when deleting a CSI volume. The external provisioner in the CSI driver will react to the deletion of the PersistentVolumeClaim and based on its reclamation policy, it issues the DeleteVolume call against the CSI volume driver commands to delete the volume. The PersistentVolume object is then deleted.

## Migrate custom in-tree storage classes to CSI

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.26, in-tree persistent volume types *kubernetes.io/azure-disk* and *kubernetes.io/azure-file* are deprecated and will no longer be supported. *In-tree drivers* refers to the storage drivers that are part of the core Kubernetes code opposed to the CSI drivers, which are plug-ins.

Removing these drivers following their deprecation isn't planned, however you should migrate to the corresponding CSI drivers *disk.csi.azure.com* and *file.csi.azure.com*. To review the migration options for your storage classes and upgrade your cluster to use Azure Disks and Azure Files CSI drivers, see [Migrate from in-tree to CSI drivers](csi-migrate-in-tree-volumes).

If you've created in-tree driver storage classes, those storage classes continue to work since CSI migration is turned on after upgrading your cluster to 1.21.x. If you want to use CSI features you'll need to perform the migration.
