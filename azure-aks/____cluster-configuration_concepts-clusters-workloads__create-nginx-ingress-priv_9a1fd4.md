Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes core concepts of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and operate containerized applications at scale on Azure.

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## What is AKS?

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications that use Kubernetes. For more information, see [What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?](what-is-aks).

## Cluster components

An AKS cluster is divided into two main components:

**Control plane**: The control plane provides the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.**Nodes**: Nodes are the underlying virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

Note

AKS managed components have the label `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby`

: `aks`

.

AKS manages the Helm releases with the prefix `aks-managed`

. Continuously increasing revisions on these releases are expected and safe.

### Control plane

The Azure managed control plane is composed of several components that help manage the cluster:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kube-apiserver` |
The API server (
|

`etcd`

[etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd)helps to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.`kube-scheduler`

[kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)) helps to make scheduling decisions. It watches for new pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.`kube-controller-manager`

[kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)) runs controller processes, such as noticing and responding when nodes go down.`cloud-controller-manager`

[cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager)) embeds cloud-specific control logic to run controllers specific to the cloud provider.### Nodes

Each AKS cluster has at least one node, which is an Azure VM that runs Kubernetes node components. The following components run on each node:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kubelet` |
The
|

`kube-proxy`

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)is a network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes.`container runtime`

[container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime)manages the execution and lifecycle of containers.## Node configuration

Configure the following settings for nodes.

### VM size and image

The *Azure VM size* for your nodes defines CPUs, memory, size, and the storage type available, such as a high-performance solid-state drive or a regular hard-disk drive. The VM size you choose depends on the workload requirements and the number of pods that you plan to run on each node. As of May 2025, the default VM SKU and size will be dynamically selected by AKS based on available capacity and quota if the parameter is left blank during deployment. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes).

In AKS, the *VM image* for your cluster's nodes is based on Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), or Windows Server 2022. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform automatically creates and configures the requested number of VMs. Agent nodes are billed as standard VMs. Any VM size discounts, including [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations), are automatically applied.

### OS disks

Default OS disk sizing is used on new clusters or node pools only when a default OS disk size isn't specified. This behavior applies to both managed and ephemeral OS disks. For more information, see [Default OS disk sizing](concepts-storage#default-os-disk-sizing).

### Resource reservations

AKS uses node resources to help the nodes function as part of the cluster. This usage can cause a discrepancy between the node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS. To maintain node performance and functionality, AKS reserves two types of resources, CPU and memory, on each node. For more information, see [Resource reservations in AKS](node-resource-reservations).

### OS

AKS supports two linux distros: Ubuntu and Azure Linux. Ubuntu is the default Linux distro on AKS. Windows node pools are also supported on AKS with the [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/en-us/windows-server/get-started/servicing-channels-comparison) as the default channel on AKS. For more information on default OS versions, see documentation on [node images](node-images).

### Container runtime

A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. The runtime helps abstract away system calls or OS-specific functionality to run containers on Linux or Windows. For Linux node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is used on Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher. For Windows Server 2019 and 2022 node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is generally available and is the only runtime option on Kubernetes version 1.23 and higher.

## Pods

A *pod* is a group of one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, but you can run multiple containers in a pod.

## Node pools

In AKS, nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. These node pools contain the underlying virtual machine scale sets and virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

When you create an AKS cluster, you define the initial number of nodes and their size (version), which creates a [system node pool](use-system-pools). System node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting critical system pods, such as CoreDNS and `konnectivity`

.

To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, you can create *user node pools*. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods.

For more information, see [Create node pools in AKS](create-node-pools) and [Manage node pools in AKS](manage-node-pools).

## Node resource group

When you create an AKS cluster in an Azure resource group, the AKS resource provider automatically creates a second resource group called the *node resource group*. This resource group contains all the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster, including VMs, virtual machine scale sets, and storage.

For more information, see the following resources:

[Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](faq)[Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?](faq)[Can I modify tags and other properties of the resources in the AKS node resource group?](faq)

## Namespaces

Kubernetes resources, such as pods and deployments, are logically grouped into *namespaces* to divide an AKS cluster and create, view, or manage access to resources.

The following namespaces are created by default in an AKS cluster:

| Namespace | Description |
|---|---|
`default` |
The
|

`kube-node-lease`

[kube-node-lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace enables nodes to communicate their availability to the control plane.`kube-public`

[kube-public](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace isn't typically used, but you can use it so that resources are visible across the whole cluster by any user.`kube-system`

[kube-system](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace is used by Kubernetes to manage cluster resources, such as`coredns`

, `konnectivity-agent`

, and `metrics-server`

. It is not recommended to deploy your own applications to this namespace. For rare cases where deploying your own applications to this namespace is necessary, see the [FAQ](faq#can-admission-controller-webhooks-affect-kube-system-and-internal-aks-namespaces-)to learn how.## Cluster modes

In AKS, you can create a cluster with the Automatic or Standard mode. AKS Automatic provides a more fully managed experience. You can manage cluster configuration, including nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings. AKS Standard provides more control over the cluster configuration, including the ability to manage node pools, scaling, and other settings.

For more information, see [AKS Automatic and Standard feature comparison](intro-aks-automatic#aks-automatic-and-standard-feature-comparison).

## Pricing tiers

AKS offers three pricing tiers for cluster management: Free, Standard, and Premium. The pricing tier you choose determines the features that are available for managing your cluster.

For more information, see [Pricing tiers for AKS cluster management](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

## Supported Kubernetes versions

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions in AKS](supported-kubernetes-versions).

# Configure NGINX ingress controller to support Azure private DNS zone with application routing add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to configure an NGINX ingress controller to work with an Azure internal load balancer. It also explains how to configure a private Azure DNS zone to enable DNS resolution for the private endpoints to resolve specific domains.

## Before you begin

An AKS cluster with the

[application routing add-on](app-routing).To attach an Azure private DNS Zone, you need the

[Owner](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner),[Azure account administrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles), or[Azure coadministrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles)role on your Azure subscription.

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use `kubectl`

, the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl`

is already installed.

The following example configures connecting to your cluster named *aks-cluster* in the *test-rg* using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name aks-cluster
```


## Create a virtual network

To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, specify a list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone with [virtual network links](/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links).

The following example creates a virtual network named *vnet-1* in the *test-rg* resource group, and one subnet named *subnet-1* to create within the virtual network with a specific address prefix.

```
az network vnet create \
--name vnet-1 \
--resource-group test-rg \
--location eastus \
--address-prefix 10.2.0.0/16 \
--subnet-name subnet-1 \
--subnet-prefixes 10.2.0.0/24
```


## Create an Azure private DNS zone

Note

You can configure the application routing add-on to automatically create records on one or more Azure global and private DNS zones for hosts defined on ingress resources. All global Azure DNS zones and all private Azure DNS zones must be in the same resource group.

Create a DNS zone using the [az network private-dns zone create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/zone?#az-network-private-dns-zone-create) command, specifying the name of the zone and the resource group to create it in. The following example creates a DNS zone named *private.contoso.com* in the *test-rg* resource group.

```
az network private-dns zone create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name private.contoso.com
```


You create a virtual network link to the DNS zone created earlier using the [az network private-dns link vnet create](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/link/vnet#az-network-private-dns-link-vnet-create) command. The following example creates a link named *dns-link* to the zone *private.contoso.com* for the virtual network *vnet-1*. Include the `--registration-enabled`

parameter to specify the link isn't registration enabled.

```
az network private-dns link vnet create \
--resource-group test-rg \
--name dns-link \
--zone-name private.contoso.com \
--virtual-network vnet-1 \
--registration-enabled false
```


The Azure DNS private zone auto registration feature manages DNS records for virtual machines deployed in a virtual network. When you link a virtual network with a private DNS zone with this setting enabled, a DNS record gets created for each Azure virtual machine for your AKS node deployed in the virtual network.

## Attach an Azure private DNS zone to the application routing add-on

Note

The `az aks approuting zone add`

command uses the permissions of the user running the command to create the [Azure DNS Zone](/en-us/azure/dns/dns-protect-private-zones-recordsets) role assignment. The **Private DNS Zone Contributor** role is a built-in role for managing private DNS resources and is assigned to the add-on's managed identity. For more information on AKS managed identities, see [Summary of managed identities](managed-identity-overview#summary-of-managed-identities-used-by-aks).

Retrieve the resource ID for the DNS zone using the

command and set the output to a variable named`az network dns zone show`

`ZONEID`

. The following example queries the zone*private.contoso.com*in the resource group*test-rg*.`ZONEID=$(az network private-dns zone show \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name private.contoso.com \ --query "id" \ --output tsv)`

Update the add-on to enable integration with Azure DNS using the

command. You can pass a comma-separated list of DNS zone resource IDs. The following example updates the AKS cluster`az aks approuting zone`

*aks-cluster*in the resource group*test-rg*.`az aks approuting zone add \ --resource-group test-rg \ --name aks-cluster \ --ids=${ZONEID} \ --attach-zones`


## Create an NGINX ingress controller with a private IP address and an internal load balancer

The application routing add-on uses a Kubernetes [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) called [ NginxIngressController](https://aka.ms/aks/approuting/nginxingresscontrollercrd) to configure NGINX ingress controllers. You can create more ingress controllers or modify an existing configuration.

`NginxIngressController`

CRD has a `loadBalancerAnnotations`

field to control the behavior of the NGINX ingress controller's service by setting load balancer annotations. For more information about load balancer annotations, see [Customizations via Kubernetes annotations](configure-load-balancer-standard#customizations-via-kubernetes-annotations).

Perform the following steps to create an NGINX ingress controller with an internal facing Azure Load Balancer with a private IP address.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**nginx-internal-controller.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-internal spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal controllerNamePrefix: nginx-internal loadBalancerAnnotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-internal-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-internal created`

Verify the ingress controller was created

You can verify the status of the NGINX ingress controller using the

command.`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

The following example output shows the created resource. It might take a few minutes for the controller to be available:

`NAME INGRESSCLASS CONTROLLERNAMEPREFIX AVAILABLE default webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com nginx True nginx-internal nginx-internal nginx-internal True`


## Deploy an application

The application routing add-on uses annotations on Kubernetes Ingress objects to create the appropriate resources.

Create the application namespace called

`aks-store`

to run the example pods using the`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace aks-store`

Deploy the AKS store application using the following YAML manifest file:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/sample-manifests/docs/app-routing/aks-store-deployments-and-services.yaml -n aks-store`


This manifest creates the necessary deployments and services for the AKS store application.

## Create the Ingress resource that uses a host name on the Azure private DNS zone and a private IP address

Update ** host** with the name of your DNS host, for example,

**store-front.private.contoso.com**. Verify you're specifying nginx-internal for the ingressClassName.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**ingress.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: store-front namespace: aks-store spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal rules: - host: store-front.private.contoso.com http: paths: - backend: service: name: store-front port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix`

Create the ingress resource using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n aks-store`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`ingress.networking.k8s.io/store-front created`


## Verify the managed Ingress was created

You can verify the managed Ingress was created using the [ kubectl get ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command.

```
kubectl get ingress -n aks-store
```


The following example output shows the created managed Ingress:

```
NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
store-front nginx-internal store-front.private.contoso.com 80 10s
```


## Verify the Azure private DNS zone was updated

In a few minutes, run the [az network private-dns record-set a list](/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-dns/record-set/a#az-network-private-dns-record-set-a-list) command to view the A records for your Azure private DNS zone. Specify the name of the resource group and the name of the DNS zone. In this example, the resource group is *test-rg* and DNS zone is *private.contoso.com*.

```
az network private-dns record-set a list \
--resource-group test-rg \
--zone-name private.contoso.com
```


The following example output shows the created record:

```
[
{
"aRecords": [
{
"ipv4Address": "10.224.0.7"
}
],
"etag": "ecc303c5-4577-4ca2-b545-d34e160d1c2d",
"fqdn": "store-front.private.contoso.com.",
"id": "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/test-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/private.contoso.com/A/store-front",
"isAutoRegistered": false,
"name": "store-front",
"resourceGroup": "test-rg",
"ttl": 300,
"type": "Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/A"
}
]
```

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

The [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is a specification for traffic management on Kubernetes clusters. It was designed as a successor and enhancement of the [Ingress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), which lacked a unified and provider-agnostic approach for advanced traffic routing.

The Managed Gateway API Installation for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) installs the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for the Kubernetes Gateway API. With the Managed Gateway API installation, you can use Gateway API functionality in a fully supported mode on AKS. However, you must also use an AKS add-on or extension that implements the Gateway API, such as the [Istio add-on](istio-gateway-api).

## Gateway API bundle version and AKS Kubernetes version mapping

The following table outlines the supported Kubernetes versions for your AKS cluster for each Gateway API bundle version for the `standard`

channel. `Experimental`

channel CRDs are disallowed and must be uninstalled before enabling the Managed Gateway API installation.

| Gateway API Bundle Version | Supported Kubernetes Versions |
|---|---|
| v1.2.1 | v1.26.0 - v1.33.x |
| v1.3.0 | v1.34.0+ |

Note

If you upgrade your AKS cluster to a new minor version after installing the Managed Gateway API CRDs, the CRDs will automatically be upgraded to the new supported Gateway API bundle version for that Kubernetes version. For instance, if you upgrade from AKS `v1.33.0`

to `v1.34.0`

and previously had the Managed Gateway API installed for bundle version `v1.2.1`

, the CRDs are automatically upgraded to bundle version `v1.3.0`

.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have at least one of the following implementations of the Gateway API installed and enabled on your cluster:

[Istio add-on](istio-deploy-addon)minor revision`asm-1-26`

and later.- If you already have an existing installation of the Gateway API CRDs on your cluster, then you must only have
`standard`

channel CRDs installed, and the Gateway API bundle version must be compatible with your cluster's Kubernetes version. See the table for the[bundle version associated with each Kubernetes version](#gateway-api-bundle-version-and-aks-kubernetes-version-mapping).

- If you already have an existing installation of the Gateway API CRDs on your cluster, then you must only have
Install the

`aks-preview`

extension using thecommand if you're using Azure CLI. You must use`az extension add`

`aks-preview`

version`19.0.0b4`

and later.`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command:`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Manage the Managed Gateway API preview feature

You can register the `ManagedGatewayAPIPreview`

feature flag by using the [ az feature register](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register) command:

```
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "ManagedGatewayAPIPreview"
```


Then you can install or uninstall the Managed Gateway API CRDs.

You can run the

command to install the Managed Gateway API CRDs on a newly created cluster. You must also enable an implementation of the Gateway API to enable the managed CRD installation.`az aks create`

`# Example: enable the managed Gateway API installation with the Istio service mesh add-on az aks create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-gateway-api --enable-azure-service-mesh`

To install the Managed Gateway API CRDs on an existing cluster with a supported implementation enabled, run the following command:

`az aks update -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-gateway-api`

To view the CRDs installed on your cluster, run the following command:

`kubectl get crds | grep "gateway.networking.k8s.io"`

`gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z grpcroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:36Z httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:37Z referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io 2025-08-29T17:52:37Z`

Verify that the CRDs have the expected annotations and that the bundle version matches the

[expected Kubernetes version](#gateway-api-bundle-version-and-aks-kubernetes-version-mapping)for your cluster.`kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io -ojsonpath={.metadata.annotations} | jq`

`{ "api-approved.kubernetes.io": "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3328", "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by": "aks", "app.kubernetes.io/part-of": <hash>, "gateway.networking.k8s.io/bundle-version": "v1.2.1", "gateway.networking.k8s.io/channel": "standard" }`

# Integrate an MCP server with an LLM Inference Service on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with the AI toolchain operator add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you connect an MCP-compliant tool server with an AI toolchain operator (KAITO) inference workspace on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), enabling secure and modular tool calling for LLM applications. You also learn how to validate end-to-end tool invocation by integrating the model with the MCP server and monitoring real-time function execution through structured responses.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

As an extension of [KAITO inference with tool calling](ai-toolchain-operator-tool-calling), the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) provides a standardized way to define and expose tools for language models to call.

Tool calling with MCP makes it easier to connect language models to real services and actions without tightly coupling logic into the model itself. Instead of embedding every function or API call into your application code, MCP lets you run a standalone tool server that exposes standardized tools or APIs that any compatible LLM can use. This clean separation means you can update tools independently, share them across models, and manage them like any other microservice.

You can bring-your-own (BYO) internal or connect external MCP servers seamlessly with your KAITO inference workspace on AKS.

## MCP with AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on AKS

You can register an external MCP server in a uniform, schema-driven format and serve it to any compatible inference endpoint, including those [deployed with a KAITO workspace](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/#model-context-protocol-mcp). This approach allows for externalizing business logic, decoupling model behavior from tool execution, and reusing tools across agents, models, and environments.

In this guide, you register a pre-defined MCP server, test real calls issued by an LLM running in a KAITO inference workspace, and confirm the entire tool execution path (from model prompt to MCP function invocation) works as intended. You have flexibility to scale or swap tools independent of your model.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one by using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Your AKS cluster is running on Kubernetes version
`1.33`

or higher. To upgrade your cluster, see[Upgrade your AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster). - Install and configure Azure CLI version
`2.77.0`

or later. To find your version, run`az --version`

. To install or update, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You have the
[AI toolchain operator add-on enabled](ai-toolchain-operator)on your cluster and a[KAITO workspace with tool calling support](ai-toolchain-operator-tool-calling)deployed on your cluster. - An external MCP server available at an accessible URL (e.g.,
`https://mcp.example.com/mcp`

) that returns valid`/list_tools`

and has`stream`

transport.

## Connect to a reference MCP server

In this example, we'll use a reference [Time MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time#time-mcp-server), which provides time zone conversion capabilities and enables LLMs to get current time information and perform conversions using standardized names.

## Port-forward the KAITO inference service

Confirm that your KAITO workspace is ready and retrieve the inference service endpoint using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get svc workspace‑phi‑4-mini-toolcall`

Note

The output might be a

`ClusterIP`

or internal address. Check which port(s) the service listens on. The default KAITO inference API is on port`80`

for HTTP. If it's only internal, you can port‑forward locally.Port-forward the inference service for testing using the

`kubectl port-forward`

command.`kubectl port-forward svc/workspace‑phi‑4‑mini-toolcall 8000:80`

Check

`/v1/models`

endpoint to confirm that`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

LLM is available using`curl`

.`curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models`

Your

`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

OpenAI-compatible inference API will be available at:`http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`


## Confirm the reference MCP server is valid

This example assumes that the Time MCP server is hosted at `https://mcp.example.com`

.

Confirm the server returns tools using

`curl`

.`curl https://mcp.example.com/mcp/list_tools`

Expected output:

`{ "tools": [ { "name": "get_current_time", "description": "Get the current time in a specific timezone", "arguments": { "timezone": "string" } }, { "name": "convert_time", "description": "Convert time between two timezones", "arguments": { "source_timezone": "string", "time": "string", "target_timezone": "string" } } ] }`


## Connect MCP server to the KAITO workspace using API request

KAITO automatically fetches tool definitions from **tools declared in API requests** or registered dynamically inside the inference runtime (vLLM + MCP tool loader).

In this guide, we create a Python virtual environment to send a tool-calling request to the `Phi-4-mini-instruct`

inference endpoint using the MCP definition and pointing to the server.

Define a new working directory for this test project.

`mkdir kaito-mcp cd kaito-mcp`

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it so that all packages are local to your test project.

`uv venv source .venv/bin/activate`

Use the open-source

[Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//index.html)framework to test the tool calling functionality and install its dependencies:`uv pip install "autogen-ext[openai]" "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[mcp]"`

Create a test file named

`test.py`

that:- Connects to the Time MCP server and loads
`get_current_time`

tool. - Connects to your KAITO inference service running at
`localhost:8000`

. - Sends an example query like “What time is it in Europe/Paris?”
- Enables automatic selection and calling of the
`get_current_time`

tool.

`import asyncio from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console from autogen_core import CancellationToken from autogen_core.models import ModelFamily, ModelInfo from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient from autogen_ext.tools.mcp import (StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter, StreamableHttpServerParams) from openai import OpenAI async def main() -> None: # Create server params for the Time MCP service server_params = StreamableHttpServerParams( url="https://mcp.example.com/mcp", timeout=30.0, terminate_on_close=True, ) # Load the get_current_time tool from the server adapter = await StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter.from_server_params(server_params, "get_current_time") # Fetch model name from KAITO's local OpenAI-compatible API model = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy").models.list().data[0].id model_info: ModelInfo = { "vision": False, "function_calling": True, "json_output": True, "family": ModelFamily.UNKNOWN, "structured_output": True, "multiple_system_messages": True, } # Connect to the KAITO inference workspace model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient( base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy", model=model, model_info=model_info ) # Define the assistant agent agent = AssistantAgent( name="time-assistant", model_client=model_client, tools=[adapter], system_message="You are a helpful assistant that can provide time information." ) # Run a test task that invokes the tool await Console( agent.run_stream( task="What time is it in Europe/Paris?", cancellation_token=CancellationToken() ) ) if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(main())`

- Connects to the Time MCP server and loads
Run the test script in your virtual environment.

`uv run test.py`

In the output of this test, you should expect the following:

- The model correctly generates a tool call using the MCP name and expected arguments.
- Autogen sends the tool call to the MCP server, the MCP server runs the logic and returns a result.
- The
`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

LLM interprets the raw tool output and provides a natural language response.

`---------- TextMessage (user) ---------- What time is it in Europe/Paris? ---------- ToolCallRequestEvent (time-assistant) ---------- [FunctionCall(id='chatcmpl-tool-xxxx', arguments='{"timezone": "Europe/Paris"}', name='get_current_time')] ---------- ToolCallExecutionEvent (time-assistant) ---------- [FunctionExecutionResult(content='{"timezone":"Europe/Paris","datetime":"2025-09-17T17:43:05+02:00","is_dst":true}', name='get_current_time', call_id='chatcmpl-tool-xxxx', is_error=False)] ---------- ToolCallSummaryMessage (time-assistant) ---------- The current time in Europe/Paris is 5:43 PM (CEST).`


## Experiment with more MCP tools

You can test the various tools available to this MCP server, such as `convert_time`

.

In your

`test.py`

file from the previous step, update your`adapter`

definition to the following:`adapter = await StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter.from_server_params(server_params, "convert_time")`

Update your

`task`

definition to invoke the new tool. For example:`task="Convert 9:30 AM New York time to Tokyo time."`

Save and run the Python script.

`uv run test.py`

Expected output:

`9:30 AM in New York is 10:30 PM in Tokyo.`


## Troubleshooting

The following table outlines common errors when testing KAITO inference with an external MCP server and how to resolve them:

| Error | How to resolve |
|---|---|
`Tool not found` |
Ensure that your tool name matches the one declared in `/mcp/list_tools` . |
`401 Unauthorized` |
If your MCP server requires an Auth token, make sure to update `server_params` to include headers with the Auth token. |
`connection refused` |
Ensure the KAITO inference service is port-forwarded properly (e.g. to `localhost:8000` ). |
`tool call ignored` |
Review the
|

# Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to use virtual nodes using Azure CLI

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and AKS clusters. To provide this communication, you create a virtual network subnet and assign delegated permissions. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). By default, AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet). This article shows you how to create a virtual network and subnets, then deploy an AKS cluster that uses advanced networking.

This article shows you how to use the Azure CLI to create and configure virtual network resources and an AKS cluster enabled with virtual nodes.

## Before you begin

Important

Before using virtual nodes with AKS, review both the [limitations of AKS virtual nodes](virtual-nodes) and the [virtual networking limitations of ACI](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-virtual-network-concepts). These limitations affect the location, networking configuration, and other configuration details of both your AKS cluster and the virtual nodes.

You need the ACI service provider registered with your subscription. You can check the status of the ACI provider registration using the

command.`az provider list`

`az provider list --query "[?contains(namespace,'Microsoft.ContainerInstance')]" -o table`

The

*Microsoft.ContainerInstance*provider should report as*Registered*, as shown in the following example output:`Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy --------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- Microsoft.ContainerInstance Registered RegistrationRequired`

If the provider shows as

*NotRegistered*, register the provider using the.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerInstance`

If using Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.49 or later. Run

`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You can also use[Azure Cloud Shell](#launch-azure-cloud-shell).

### Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured.

To open the Cloud Shell, select **Try it** from the upper right corner of a code block. You can also launch Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by going to [https://shell.azure.com/bash](https://shell.azure.com/bash). Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, paste it into the Cloud Shell, and press enter to run it.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`


## Create a virtual network

Important

Virtual node requires a custom virtual network and associated subnet. It can't be associated with the same virtual network as the AKS cluster.

Create a virtual network using the

command. The following example creates a virtual network named`az network vnet create`

*myVnet*with an address prefix of*10.0.0.0/8*and a subnet named*myAKSSubnet*. The address prefix of this subnet defaults to*10.240.0.0/16*.`az network vnet create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myVnet \ --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 \ --subnet-name myAKSSubnet \ --subnet-prefix 10.240.0.0/16`

Create an extra subnet for the virtual nodes using the

command. The following example creates a subnet named`az network vnet subnet create`

*myVirtualNodeSubnet*with an address prefix of*10.241.0.0/16*.`az network vnet subnet create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --vnet-name myVnet \ --name myVirtualNodeSubnet \ --address-prefixes 10.241.0.0/16`


## Create an AKS cluster with managed identity

Get the subnet ID using the

command.`az network vnet subnet show`

`az network vnet subnet show --resource-group myResourceGroup --vnet-name myVnet --name myAKSSubnet --query id -o tsv`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and replace`az aks create`

`<subnetId>`

with the ID obtained in the previous step. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*with five nodes.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 5 \ --network-plugin azure \ --vnet-subnet-id <subnetId> \ --generate-ssh-keys`

After several minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


For more information on managed identities, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

## Enable the virtual nodes addon

Note

If you have an existing Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster created that uses Azure CNI for the Advanced Networking you should be able to enable virtual nodes as an add-on using the CLI.

Enable virtual nodes using the

command. The following example uses the subnet named`az aks enable-addons`

*myVirtualNodeSubnet*created in a previous step.`az aks enable-addons \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --addons virtual-node \ --subnet-name myVirtualNodeSubnet`


## Connect to the cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. This step downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command, which returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the single VM node created and the virtual node for Linux,

*virtual-node-aci-linux*:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION virtual-node-aci-linux Ready agent 28m v1.11.2 aks-agentpool-14693408-0 Ready agent 32m v1.11.2`


## Deploy a sample app

Create a file named

`virtual-node.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. The YAML schedules the container on the node by defining a[nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)and[toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/).`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: aci-helloworld spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: aci-helloworld template: metadata: labels: app: aci-helloworld spec: containers: - name: aci-helloworld image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld ports: - containerPort: 80 nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/role: agent kubernetes.io/os: linux type: virtual-kubelet tolerations: - key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider operator: Exists - key: azure.com/aci effect: NoSchedule`

Run the application using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f virtual-node.yaml`

Get a list of pods and the scheduled node using the

command with the`kubectl get pods`

`-o wide`

argument.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The pod is scheduled on the virtual node

*virtual-node-aci-linux*, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE aci-helloworld-9b55975f-bnmfl 1/1 Running 0 4m 10.241.0.4 virtual-node-aci-linux`

The pod is assigned an internal IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet delegated for use with virtual nodes.


Note

If you use images stored in Azure Container Registry, [configure and use a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). A current limitation of virtual nodes is you can't use integrated Microsoft Entra service principal authentication. If you don't use a secret, pods scheduled on virtual nodes fail to start and report the error `HTTP response status code 400 error code "InaccessibleImage"`

.

## Test the virtual node pod

Test the pod running on the virtual node by browsing to the demo application with a web client. As the pod is assigned an internal IP address, you can quickly test this connectivity from another pod on the AKS cluster.

Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it using the following

`kubectl run -it`

command.`kubectl run -it --rm testvk --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

Install

`curl`

in the pod using`apt-get`

.`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

Access the address of your pod using

`curl`

, such as. Provide your own internal IP address shown in the previous[http://10.241.0.4](http://10.241.0.4)`kubectl get pods`

command.`curl -L http://10.241.0.4`

The demo application is displayed, as shown in the following condensed example output:

`<html> <head> <title>Welcome to Azure Container Instances!</title> </head> [...]`

Close the terminal session to your test pod with

`exit`

. When your session is ends, the pod is deleted.

## Remove virtual nodes

Delete the

`aci-helloworld`

pod running on the virtual node using the`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete -f virtual-node.yaml`

Disable the virtual nodes using the

command.`az aks disable-addons`

`az aks disable-addons --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --addons virtual-node`

Remove the virtual network resources and resource group using the following commands.

`# Change the name of your resource group, cluster and network resources as needed RES_GROUP=myResourceGroup AKS_CLUSTER=myAKScluster AKS_VNET=myVnet AKS_SUBNET=myVirtualNodeSubnet # Get AKS node resource group NODE_RES_GROUP=$(az aks show --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --query nodeResourceGroup --output tsv) # Get network profile ID NETWORK_PROFILE_ID=$(az network profile list --resource-group $NODE_RES_GROUP --query "[0].id" --output tsv) # Delete the network profile az network profile delete --id $NETWORK_PROFILE_ID -y # Grab the service association link ID SAL_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $RES_GROUP --vnet-name $AKS_VNET --name $AKS_SUBNET --query id --output tsv)/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/serviceAssociationLinks/default # Delete the service association link for the subnet az resource delete --ids $SAL_ID --api-version 2021-10-01 # Delete the subnet delegation to Azure Container Instances az network vnet subnet update --resource-group $RES_GROUP --vnet-name $AKS_VNET --name $AKS_SUBNET --remove delegations`


## Next steps

In this article, you scheduled a pod on the virtual node and assigned a private internal IP address. You could instead create a service deployment and route traffic to your pod through a load balancer or ingress controller. For more information, see [Create a basic ingress controller in AKS](ingress-basic).

Virtual nodes are often one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

After you [configure Azure NetApp Files for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files), you can provision Azure NetApp Files volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service.

Azure NetApp Files supports volumes using [NFS](azure-netapp-files-nfs) (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), SMB, and [dual-protocol](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol) (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB).

- This article describes details for provisioning SMB volumes statically or dynamically.
- For information about provisioning NFS volumes statically or dynamically, see
[Provision Azure NetApp Files NFS volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-nfs). - For information about provisioning dual-protocol volumes statically, see
[Provision Azure NetApp Files dual-protocol volumes for Azure Kubernetes Service](azure-netapp-files-dual-protocol)

## Statically configure for applications that use SMB volumes

This section describes how to create an SMB volume on Azure NetApp Files and expose the volume statically to Kubernetes for a containerized application to consume.

### Create an SMB Volume

Define variables for later usage. Replace

*myresourcegroup*,*mylocation*,*myaccountname*,*mypool1*,*premium*,*myfilepath*,*myvolsize*,*myvolname*, and*virtnetid*with an appropriate value for your environment. The filepath must be unique within all ANF accounts.`RESOURCE_GROUP="myresourcegroup" LOCATION="mylocation" ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME="myaccountname" POOL_NAME="mypool1" SERVICE_LEVEL="premium" # Valid values are standard, premium, and ultra UNIQUE_FILE_PATH="myfilepath" VOLUME_SIZE_GIB="myvolsize" VOLUME_NAME="myvolname" VNET_ID="vnetId" SUBNET_ID="anfSubnetId"`

Create a volume using the

command.`az netappfiles volume create`

`az netappfiles volume create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --location $LOCATION \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --pool-name $POOL_NAME \ --name "$VOLUME_NAME" \ --service-level $SERVICE_LEVEL \ --vnet $VNET_ID \ --subnet $SUBNET_ID \ --usage-threshold $VOLUME_SIZE_GIB \ --file-path $UNIQUE_FILE_PATH \ --protocol-types CIFS`


### Create a secret with the domain credentials

Create a secret on your AKS cluster to access the Active Directory (AD) server using the

command. This secret will be used by the Kubernetes persistent volume to access the Azure NetApp Files SMB volume. Use the following command to create the secret, replacing`kubectl create secret`

`USERNAME`

with your username,`PASSWORD`

with your password, and`DOMAIN_NAME`

with your domain name for your AD.`kubectl create secret generic smbcreds --from-literal=username=USERNAME --from-literal=password="PASSWORD" --from-literal=domain='DOMAIN_NAME'`

Check the secret has been created.

`kubectl get secret NAME TYPE DATA AGE smbcreds Opaque 2 20h`


### Install an SMB CSI driver

You must install a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver to create a Kubernetes SMB `PersistentVolume`

.

Install the SMB CSI driver on your cluster using helm. Be sure to set the

`windows.enabled`

option to`true`

:`helm repo add csi-driver-smb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb/master/charts helm install csi-driver-smb csi-driver-smb/csi-driver-smb --namespace kube-system --version v1.13.0 --set windows.enabled=true`

For other methods of installing the SMB CSI Driver, see

[Install SMB CSI driver master version on a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb/blob/master/docs/install-csi-driver-master.md).Verify that the

`csi-smb`

controller pod is running and each worker node has a pod running using thecommand:`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep csi-smb csi-smb-controller-68df7b4758-xf2m9 3/3 Running 0 3m46s csi-smb-node-s6clj 3/3 Running 0 3m47s csi-smb-node-win-tfxvk 3/3 Running 0 3m47s`


### Create the persistent volume

List the details of your volume using

. Replace the variables with appropriate values from your Azure NetApp Files account and environment if not defined in a previous step.`az netappfiles volume show`

`az netappfiles volume show \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --account-name $ANF_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --pool-name $POOL_NAME \ --volume-name "$VOLUME_NAME -o JSON`

The following output is an example of the above command executed with real values.

`{ ... "creationToken": "myvolname", ... "mountTargets": [ { ... " "smbServerFqdn": "ANF-1be3.contoso.com", ... } ], ... }`

Create a file named

`pv-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. If necessary, replace`myvolname`

with the`creationToken`

and replace`ANF-1be3.contoso.com\myvolname`

with the value of`smbServerFqdn`

from the previous step. Be sure to include your AD credentials secret along with the namespace where the secret is located that you created in a prior step.`apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolume metadata: name: anf-pv-smb spec: storageClassName: "" capacity: storage: 100Gi accessModes: - ReadWriteMany persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain mountOptions: - dir_mode=0777 - file_mode=0777 - vers=3.0 csi: driver: smb.csi.k8s.io readOnly: false volumeHandle: myvolname # make sure it's a unique name in the cluster volumeAttributes: source: \\ANF-1be3.contoso.com\myvolname nodeStageSecretRef: name: smbcreds namespace: default`

Create the persistent volume using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f pv-smb.yaml`

Verify the status of the persistent volume is

*Available*using thecommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pv pv-smb`


### Create a persistent volume claim

Create a file name

`pvc-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML.`apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: anf-pvc-smb spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany volumeName: anf-pv-smb storageClassName: "" resources: requests: storage: 100Gi`

Create the persistent volume claim using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f pvc-smb.yaml`

Verify the status of the persistent volume claim is

*Bound*by using the[kubectl describe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#describe)command:`kubectl describe pvc pvc-smb`


### Mount with a pod

Create a file named

`iis-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. This file will be used to create an Internet Information Services pod to mount the volume to path`/inetpub/wwwroot`

.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: iis-pod labels: app: web spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": windows volumes: - name: smb persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: anf-pvc-smb containers: - name: web image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore resources: limits: cpu: 1 memory: 800M ports: - containerPort: 80 volumeMounts: - name: smb mountPath: "/inetpub/wwwroot" readOnly: false`

Create the pod using the

[kubectl apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply)command:`kubectl apply -f iis-smb.yaml`

Verify the pod is

*Running*and`/inetpub/wwwroot`

is mounted from SMB by using the[kubectl describe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#describe)command:`kubectl describe pod iis-pod`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Name: iis-pod Namespace: default Priority: 0 Node: akswin000001/10.225.5.246 Start Time: Fri, 05 May 2023 09:34:41 -0400 Labels: app=web Annotations: <none> Status: Running IP: 10.225.5.248 IPs: IP: 10.225.5.248 Containers: web: Container ID: containerd://39a1659b6a2b6db298df630237b2b7d959d1b1722edc81ce9b1bc7f06237850c Image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore Image ID: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis@sha256:0f0114d0f6c6ee569e1494953efdecb76465998df5eba951dc760ac5812c7409 Port: 80/TCP Host Port: 0/TCP State: Running Started: Fri, 05 May 2023 09:34:55 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Limits: cpu: 1 memory: 800M Requests: cpu: 1 memory: 800M Environment: <none> Mounts: /inetpub/wwwroot from smb (rw) /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-mbnv8 (ro) ...`

Verify your volume has been mounted on the pod by using the

[kubectl exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec)command to connect to the pod, and then use`dir`

command in the correct directory to check if the volume is mounted and the size matches the size of the volume you provisioned.`kubectl exec -it iis-pod –- cmd.exe`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.1668] (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. C:\>cd /inetpub/wwwroot C:\inetpub\wwwroot>dir Volume in drive C has no label. Volume Serial Number is 86BB-AA55 Directory of C:\inetpub\wwwroot 05/04/2023 08:15 PM <DIR> . 05/04/2023 08:15 PM <DIR> .. 0 File(s) 0 bytes 2 Dir(s) 107,373,838,336 bytes free`


## Dynamically configure for applications that use SMB volumes

This section covers how to use Trident to dynamically create an SMB volume on Azure NetApp Files and automatically mount it to a containerized windows application.

### Install Trident

To dynamically provision SMB volumes, you need to install Trident version 22.10 or later. Dynamically provisioning SMB volumes requires windows worker nodes.

Trident is NetApp's dynamic storage provisioner that is purpose-built for Kubernetes. Simplify the consumption of storage for Kubernetes applications using Trident's industry-standard [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) driver. Trident deploys on Kubernetes clusters as pods and provides dynamic storage orchestration services for your Kubernetes workloads.

Trident can be installed using the Trident operator (manually or using [Helm](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-operator.html)) or [ tridentctl](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy-tridentctl.html). To learn more about these installation methods and how they work, see the

[Install Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html).

#### Install Trident using Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be installed on your workstation to install Trident using this method. For other methods of installing Trident, see the [Trident Install Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-get-started/kubernetes-deploy.html). If you have windows worker nodes in the cluster, ensure to enable windows with any installation method.

To install Trident using Helm for a cluster with windows worker nodes, run the following commands:

`helm repo add netapp-trident https://netapp.github.io/trident-helm-chart helm install trident netapp-trident/trident-operator --version 23.04.0 --create-namespace --namespace trident –-set windows=true`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`NAME: trident LAST DEPLOYED: Fri May 5 14:23:05 2023 NAMESPACE: trident STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None NOTES: Thank you for installing trident-operator, which will deploy and manage NetApp's Trident CSI storage provisioner for Kubernetes. Your release is named 'trident' and is installed into the 'trident' namespace. Please note that there must be only one instance of Trident (and trident-operator) in a Kubernetes cluster. To configure Trident to manage storage resources, you will need a copy of tridentctl, which is available in pre-packaged Trident releases. You may find all Trident releases and source code online at https://github.com/NetApp/trident. To learn more about the release, try: $ helm status trident $ helm get all trident`

To confirm Trident was installed successfully, run the following

command:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe torc trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Name: trident Namespace: Labels: app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm Annotations: meta.helm.sh/release-name: trident meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: trident API Version: trident.netapp.io/v1 Kind: TridentOrchestrator Metadata: ...

### Create a backend

A backend must be created to instruct Trident about the Azure NetApp Files subscription and where it needs to create volumes. For more information about backends, see [Azure NetApp Files backend configuration options and examples](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/anf-examples.html).

Create a file named

`backend-secret-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Change the`Client ID`

and`clientSecret`

to the correct values for your environment.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: backend-tbc-anf-secret type: Opaque stringData: clientID: 00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444 clientSecret: rR0rUmWXfNioN1KhtHisiSAnoTherboGuskey6pU`

Create a file named

`backend-anf-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML. Change the`ClientID`

,`clientSecret`

,`subscriptionID`

,`tenantID`

,`location`

, and`serviceLevel`

to the correct values for your environment. The`tenantID`

,`clientID`

, and`clientSecret`

can be found from an application registration in Microsoft Entra ID with sufficient permissions for the Azure NetApp Files service. The application registration includes the Owner or Contributor role predefined by Azure. The Azure location must contain at least one delegated subnet. The`serviceLevel`

must match the`serviceLevel`

configured for the capacity pool in[Configure Azure NetApp Files for AKS workloads](azure-netapp-files#configure-azure-netapp-files-for-aks-workloads).`apiVersion: trident.netapp.io/v1 kind: TridentBackendConfig metadata: name: backend-tbc-anf-smb spec: version: 1 storageDriverName: azure-netapp-files subscriptionID: aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e tenantID: aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee location: eastus serviceLevel: Premium credentials: name: backend-tbc-anf-secret nasType: smb`

Create the secret and backend using the

command.`kubectl apply`

Create the secret:

`kubectl apply -f backend-secret.yaml -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`secret/backend-tbc-anf-secret created`

Create the backend:

`kubectl apply -f backend-anf.yaml -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`tridentbackendconfig.trident.netapp.io/backend-tbc-anf created`

Verify the backend was created by running the following command:

`kubectl get tridentbackends -n trident`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`NAME BACKEND BACKEND UUID tbe-9shfq backend-tbc-anf-smb 09cc2d43-8197-475f-8356-da7707bae203`


### Create a secret with the domain credentials for SMB

Create a secret on your AKS cluster to access the AD server using the

command. This information will be used by the Kubernetes persistent volume to access the Azure NetApp Files SMB volume. Use the following command, replacing`kubectl create secret`

`DOMAIN_NAME\USERNAME`

with your domain name and username and`PASSWORD`

with your password.`kubectl create secret generic smbcreds --from-literal=username=DOMAIN_NAME\USERNAME –from-literal=password="PASSWORD"`

Verify that the secret has been created.

`kubectl get secret`

The output resembles the following example:

`NAME TYPE DATA AGE smbcreds Opaque 2 2h`


### Create a storage class

A storage class is used to define how a unit of storage is dynamically created with a persistent volume. To consume Azure NetApp Files volumes, a storage class must be created.

Create a file named

`anf-storageclass-smb.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML.`apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 kind: StorageClass metadata: name: anf-sc-smb provisioner: csi.trident.netapp.io allowVolumeExpansion: true parameters: backendType: "azure-netapp-files" trident.netapp.io/nasType: "smb" csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name: "smbcreds" csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: "default"`

Create the storage class using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-storageclass-smb.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`storageclass/anf-sc-smb created`

Run the

command to view the status of the storage class:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get sc anf-sc-smb NAME PROVISIONER RECLAIMPOLICY VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE anf-sc-smb csi.trident.netapp.io Delete Immediate true 13s`


### Create a PVC

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. Upon the creation of a persistent volume claim, Trident automatically creates an Azure NetApp Files SMB share and makes it available for Kubernetes workloads to consume.

Create a file named

`anf-pvc-smb.yaml`

and copy the following YAML. In this example, a 100-GiB volume is created with`ReadWriteMany`

access and uses the storage class created in[Create a storage class](#create-a-storage-class).`kind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: anf-pvc-smb spec: accessModes: - ReadWriteMany resources: requests: storage: 100Gi storageClassName: anf-sc-smb`

Create the persistent volume claim with the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-pvc-smb.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`persistentvolumeclaim/anf-pvc-smb created`

To view information about the persistent volume claim, run the

command:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pvc`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE anf-pvc-smb Bound pvc-209268f5-c175-4a23-b61b-e34faf5b6239 100Gi RWX anf-sc-smb 5m38s`

To view the persistent volume created by Trident, run the following

command:`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pv NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE pvc-209268f5-c175-4a23-b61b-e34faf5b6239 100Gi RWX Delete Bound default/anf-pvc-smb anf-sc-smb 5m52s`


### Use the persistent volume

After the PVC is created, a pod can be spun up to access the Azure NetApp Files volume. The following manifest can be used to define an Internet Information Services (IIS) pod that mounts the Azure NetApp Files SMB share created in the previous step. In this example, the volume is mounted at `/inetpub/wwwroot`

.

Create a file named

`anf-iis-pod.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: iis-pod labels: app: web spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": windows volumes: - name: smb persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: anf-pvc-smb containers: - name: web image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore resources: limits: cpu: 1 memory: 800M ports: - containerPort: 80 volumeMounts: - name: smb mountPath: "/inetpub/wwwroot" readOnly: false`

Create the deployment using the

command:`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f anf-iis-deploy-pod.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`pod/iis-pod created`

Verify that the pod is running and is mounted via SMB to

`/inetpub/wwwroot`

by using thecommand:`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe pod iis-pod`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Name: iis-pod Namespace: default Priority: 0 Node: akswin000001/10.225.5.246 Start Time: Fri, 05 May 2023 15:16:36 -0400 Labels: app=web Annotations: <none> Status: Running IP: 10.225.5.252 IPs: IP: 10.225.5.252 Containers: web: Container ID: containerd://1e4959f2b49e7ad842b0ec774488a6142ac9152ca380c7ba4d814ae739d5ed3e Image: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore Image ID: mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis@sha256:0f0114d0f6c6ee569e1494953efdecb76465998df5eba951dc760ac5812c7409 Port: 80/TCP Host Port: 0/TCP State: Running Started: Fri, 05 May 2023 15:16:44 -0400 Ready: True Restart Count: 0 Limits: cpu: 1 memory: 800M Requests: cpu: 1 memory: 800M Environment: <none> Mounts: /inetpub/wwwroot from smb (rw) /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-zznzs (ro)`

Verify that your volume has been mounted on the pod by using

[kubectl exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec)to connect to the pod. And then use the`dir`

command in the correct directory to check if the volume is mounted and the size matches the size of the volume you provisioned.`kubectl exec -it iis-pod –- cmd.exe`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.1668] (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. C:\>cd /inetpub/wwwroot C:\inetpub\wwwroot>dir Volume in drive C has no label. Volume Serial Number is 86BB-AA55 Directory of C:\inetpub\wwwroot 05/05/2023 01:38 AM <DIR> . 05/05/2023 01:38 AM <DIR> .. 0 File(s) 0 bytes 2 Dir(s) 107,373,862,912 bytes free C:\inetpub\wwwroot>exit`

# Best practices for advanced scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the kube-scheduler

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. Advanced features provided by the Kubernetes scheduler let you control:

- Which pods can be scheduled on certain nodes.
- How multi-pod applications can be appropriately distributed across the cluster.

This best practices article focuses on advanced Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Use taints and tolerations to limit what pods can be scheduled on nodes.
- Give preference to pods to run on certain nodes with node selectors or node affinity.
- Split apart or group together pods with inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity.
- Restrict scheduling of workloads that require GPUs only on nodes with schedulable GPUs.

If additional capabilities or ML frameworks are needed to schedule and queue batch workloads, you can [install and configure Kueue on AKS](kueue-overview) to ensure efficient, policy-driven scheduling in AKS clusters.

If fine-grained scheduler configuration is needed to optimize how pods and jobs prioritize specific nodes, storage resources, topology, and more, you can [configure a scheduler on AKS](concepts-scheduler-configuration).

## Provide dedicated nodes using taints and tolerations


Best practice guidance:Limit access for resource-intensive applications, such as ingress controllers, to specific nodes. Keep node resources available for workloads that require them, and don't allow scheduling of other workloads on the nodes.


When you create your AKS cluster, you can deploy nodes with GPU support or a large number of powerful CPUs. For more information, see [Use GPUs on AKS](gpu-cluster). You can use these nodes for large data processing workloads such as machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI).

Because this node resource hardware is typically expensive to deploy, limit the workloads that can be scheduled on these nodes. Instead, dedicate some nodes in the cluster to run ingress services and prevent other workloads.

This support for different nodes is provided by using multiple node pools. An AKS cluster supports one or more node pools.

The Kubernetes scheduler uses taints and tolerations to restrict what workloads can run on nodes.

- Apply a
**taint**to a node to indicate only specific pods can be scheduled on them. - Then apply a
**toleration**to a pod, allowing them to*tolerate*a node's taint.

When you deploy a pod to an AKS cluster, Kubernetes only schedules pods on nodes whose taint aligns with the toleration. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods aren't scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node, marking the node so that it doesn't accept any pods that don't tolerate the taints.

For example, assume you added a node pool in your AKS cluster for nodes with GPU support. You define name, such as *gpu*, then a value for scheduling. Setting this value to *NoSchedule* restricts the Kubernetes scheduler from scheduling pods with undefined toleration on the node.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name taintnp \
--node-taints sku=gpu:NoSchedule \
--no-wait
```


With a taint applied to nodes in the node pool, you define a toleration in the pod specification that allows scheduling on the nodes. The following example defines the `sku: gpu`

and `effect: NoSchedule`

to tolerate the taint applied to the node pool in the previous step:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
tolerations:
- key: "sku"
operator: "Equal"
value: "gpu"
effect: "NoSchedule"
```


When this pod is deployed using `kubectl apply -f gpu-toleration.yaml`

, Kubernetes can successfully schedule the pod on the nodes with the taint applied. This logical isolation lets you control access to resources within a cluster.

When you apply taints, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to define the required tolerations in their deployments.

For more information about how to use multiple node pools in AKS, see [Create multiple node pools for a cluster in AKS](create-node-pools).

### Behavior of taints and tolerations in AKS

When you upgrade a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations follow a set pattern as they're applied to new nodes:

#### Default clusters that use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

You can [taint a node pool](manage-node-pools#specify-a-taint-label-or-tag-for-a-node-pool) from the AKS API to have newly scaled out nodes receive API specified node taints.

Let's assume:

- You begin with a two-node cluster:
*node1*and*node2*. - You upgrade the node pool.
- Two other nodes are created:
*node3*and*node4*. - The taints are passed on respectively.
- The original
*node1*and*node2*are deleted.

#### Clusters without Virtual Machine Scale Sets support

Again, let's assume:

- You have a two-node cluster:
*node1*and*node2*. - You upgrade the node pool.
- An extra node is created:
*node3*. - The taints from
*node1*are applied to*node3*. *node1*is deleted.- A new
*node1*is created to replace to original*node1*. - The
*node2*taints are applied to the new*node1*. *node2*is deleted.

In essence, *node1* becomes *node3*, and *node2* becomes the new *node1*.

When you scale a node pool in AKS, taints and tolerations don't carry over by design.

## Control pod scheduling using node selectors and affinity


Best practice guidanceControl the scheduling of pods on nodes using node selectors, node affinity, or inter-pod affinity. These settings allow the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads, such as by hardware in the node.


Taints and tolerations logically isolate resources with a hard cut-off. If the pod doesn't tolerate a node's taint, it isn't scheduled on the node.

Alternatively, you can use node selectors. For example, you label nodes to indicate locally attached SSD storage or a large amount of memory, and then define in the pod specification a node selector. Kubernetes schedules those pods on a matching node.

Unlike tolerations, pods without a matching node selector can still be scheduled on labeled nodes. This behavior allows unused resources on the nodes to consume, but prioritizes pods that define the matching node selector.

Let's look at an example of nodes with a high amount of memory. These nodes prioritize pods that request a high amount of memory. To ensure the resources don't sit idle, they also allow other pods to run. The following example command adds a node pool with the label *hardware=highmem* to the *myAKSCluster* in the *myResourceGroup*. All nodes in that node pool have this label.

```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--cluster-name myAKSCluster \
--name labelnp \
--node-count 1 \
--labels hardware=highmem \
--no-wait
```


A pod specification then adds the `nodeSelector`

property to define a node selector that matches the label set on a node:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
nodeSelector:
hardware: highmem
```


When you use these scheduler options, work with your application developers and owners to allow them to correctly define their pod specifications.

For more information about using node selectors, see [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/).

### Node affinity

A node selector is a basic solution for assigning pods to a given node. *Node affinity* provides more flexibility, allowing you to define what happens if the pod can't be matched with a node. You can:

*Require*that Kubernetes scheduler matches a pod with a labeled host. Or,*Prefer*a match but allow the pod to be scheduled on a different host if no match is available.

The following example sets the node affinity to *requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution*. This affinity requires the Kubernetes schedule to use a node with a matching label. If no node is available, the pod has to wait for scheduling to continue. To allow the pod to be scheduled on a different node, you can instead set the value to * preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreDuringExecution*:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: app
spec:
containers:
- name: app
image: <your-workload>:gpu
resources:
requests:
cpu: 0.5
memory: 2Gi
limits:
cpu: 4.0
memory: 16Gi
affinity:
nodeAffinity:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
- key: hardware
operator: In
values:
- highmem
```


The *IgnoredDuringExecution* part of the setting indicates that the pod shouldn't be evicted from the node if the node labels change. The Kubernetes scheduler only uses the updated node labels for new pods being scheduled, not pods already scheduled on the nodes.

For more information, see [Affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

### Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity

One final approach for the Kubernetes scheduler to logically isolate workloads is using inter-pod affinity or anti-affinity. These settings define that pods either *shouldn't* or *should* be scheduled on a node that has an existing matching pod. By default, the Kubernetes scheduler tries to schedule multiple pods in a replica set across nodes. You can define more specific rules around this behavior.

For example, you have a web application that also uses an Azure Cache for Redis.

- You use pod anti-affinity rules to request that the Kubernetes scheduler distributes replicas across nodes.
- You use affinity rules to ensure each web app component is scheduled on the same host as a corresponding cache.

The distribution of pods across nodes looks like the following example:

Node 1 |
Node 2 |
Node 3 |
|---|---|---|
| webapp-1 | webapp-2 | webapp-3 |
| cache-1 | cache-2 | cache-3 |

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity provide a more complex deployment than node selectors or node affinity. With the deployment, you logically isolate resources and control how Kubernetes schedules pods on nodes.

For a complete example of this web application with Azure Cache for Redis example, see [Co-locate pods on the same node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#always-co-located-in-the-same-node).

# Ingress in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Ingress in AKS is a Kubernetes resource that manages external HTTP-like traffic access to [services](concepts-network-services) within a cluster. An AKS ingress may provide services like load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. For more information about Kubernetes Ingress, see the [Kubernetes Ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Ingress controllers

When managing application traffic, Ingress controllers provide advanced capabilities by operating at layer 7. They can route HTTP traffic to different applications based on the inbound URL, allowing for more intelligent and flexible traffic distribution rules. For example, an ingress controller can direct traffic to different microservices depending on the URL path, enhancing the efficiency and organization of your services.

On the other hand, a LoadBalancer-type Service, when created, sets up an underlying Azure load balancer resource. This load balancer works at layer 4, distributing traffic to the pods in your Service on a specified port. However, layer 4 services are unaware of the actual applications and can't implement these types of complex routing rules.

Understanding the distinction between these two approaches helps in selecting the right tool for your traffic management needs.

## Compare ingress options

The following table lists the feature differences between the different ingress controller options:

| Feature | Application Routing addon | Application Gateway for Containers | Azure Service Mesh/Istio-based service mesh |
|---|---|---|---|
Ingress/Gateway controller |
NGINX ingress controller | Azure Application Gateway for Containers | Istio Ingress Gateway |
API |
Ingress API | Ingress API and Gateway API |
|

**Hosting****Scaling****Load balancing****SSL termination****mTLS****Static IP Address****Azure Key Vault stored SSL certificates****Azure DNS integration for DNS zone management**The following table lists the different scenarios where you might use each ingress controller:

| Ingress option | When to use |
|---|---|
Managed NGINX - Application Routing addon |
• In-cluster hosted, customizable, and scalable NGINX ingress controllers. • Basic load balancing and routing capabilities. • Internal and external load balancer configuration. • Static IP address configuration. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress API. |
Application Gateway for Containers |
• Azure hosted ingress gateway. • Flexible deployment strategies managed by the controller or bring your own Application Gateway for Containers. • Advanced traffic management features such as automatic retries, availability zone resiliency, mutual authentication (mTLS) to backend target, traffic splitting / weighted round robin, and autoscaling. • Integration with Azure Key Vault for certificate management. • Integration with Azure DNS Zones for public and private DNS management. • Supports the Ingress and Gateway APIs. |
Istio Ingress Gateway |
• Based on Envoy, when using with Istio for a service mesh. • Advanced traffic management features such as rate limiting and circuit breaking. • Support for mTLS |

Note

Gateway API for [Istio ingress traffic](istio-deploy-ingress) is not yet supported for the Istio add-on, but is currently under active development.

## Create an Ingress resource

The application routing addon is the recommended way to configure an Ingress controller in AKS. The application routing addon is a fully managed ingress controller for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides the following features:

Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller.

Integration with Azure DNS for public and private zone management.

SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.


For more information about the application routing addon, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

## Client source IP preservation

Configure your ingress controller to preserve the client source IP on requests to containers in your AKS cluster. When your ingress controller routes a client's request to a container in your AKS cluster, the original source IP of that request is unavailable to the target container. When you enable *client source IP preservation*, the source IP for the client is available in the request header under *X-Forwarded-For*.

If you're using client source IP preservation on your ingress controller, you can't use TLS pass-through. Client source IP preservation and TLS pass-through can be used with other services, such as the *LoadBalancer* type.

To learn more about client source IP preservation, see [How client source IP preservation works for LoadBalancer Services in AKS](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/how-client-source-ip-preservation-works-for-loadbalancer/ba-p/3033722#:%7E:text=Enable%20Client%20source%20IP%20preservation%201%20Edit%20loadbalancer,is%20the%20same%20as%20the%20source%20IP%20%28srjumpbox%29.).

# Get kubelet logs from Azure Kubernetes Service cluster nodes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You might need to review logs to troubleshoot a problem in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. You can use tools in the Azure portal to view logs for AKS [main components](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) and [cluster containers](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). Occasionally, you might need to get *kubelet* logs from AKS nodes to help you troubleshoot an issue.

This article shows you how to use `journalctl`

to view kubelet logs on an AKS node.

Alternatively, you can collect kubelet logs by using the [syslog collection feature in Container insights in Azure Monitor](https://aka.ms/CISyslog).

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, create one by using the [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To interact with your AKS cluster, first get the cluster credentials by using the Azure CLI:

```
export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="<ResourceGroupName>"
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="<AKSClusterName>"
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME
```


This command configures kubectl to use the credentials for your AKS cluster.

## Use the kubectl raw command

You can quickly view any node's kubelet logs by using the following command:

```
export NODE_NAME="aks-agentpool-xxxxxxx-0"
kubectl get --raw "/api/v1/nodes/$NODE_NAME/proxy/logs/messages" | grep kubelet
```


Results:

```
I0508 12:26:17.905042 8672 kubelet_node_status.go:497] Using Node Hostname from cloudprovider: "aks-agentpool-xxxxxxx-0"
I0508 12:26:27.943494 8672 kubelet_node_status.go:497] Using Node Hostname from cloudprovider: "aks-agentpool-xxxxxxx-0"
I0508 12:26:28.920125 8672 server.go:796] GET /stats/summary: (10.370874ms) 200 [[Ruby] 10.244.0.x:52492]
I0508 12:26:37.964650 8672 kubelet_node_status.go:497] Using Node Hostname from cloudprovider: "aks-agentpool-xxxxxxx-0"
...
```


## Create an SSH connection

You must create a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) connection with the node you need to view kubelet logs for. To create this connection, complete the steps that are described in [SSH into AKS cluster nodes](ssh).

## Get kubelet logs

After you connect to the node by using `kubectl debug`

, run the following command to pull the kubelet logs:

```
chroot /host
journalctl -u kubelet -o cat
```


Note

For Windows nodes, the log data is in `C:\k`

and can be viewed by using the `more`

command:

```
more C:\k\kubelet.log
```


The following example output shows kubelet log data:

# Storage options for applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Applications running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) might need to store and retrieve data. While some application workloads can use local, fast storage on unneeded, emptied nodes, others require storage that persists on more regular data volumes within the Azure platform.

Multiple pods might need to:

- Share the same data volumes.
- Reattach data volumes if the pod is rescheduled on a different node.

You also might need to collect and store sensitive data or application configuration information into pods.

This article introduces the core concepts that provide storage to your applications in AKS:

## Default OS disk sizing

### Ephemeral OS disks

If you select a VM SKU that supports Ephemeral OS disks but don't specify an OS disk size, AKS by default provisions an Ephemeral OS disk with a size that scales according to the total temp storage of the VM SKU so long as the temp is *at least 128GiB*. For example, the `Standard_D8ds_v5`

SKU with a temp disk size of 300GiB will receive a 300GiB Ephemeral OS disk by default if the disk parameters are unspecified.

If you want to use the temp storage of the VM SKU, you need to specify the OS disk size during deployment, otherwise it's consumed by default.

Important

Default Ephemeral OS disk sizing is only used on new clusters or node pools where Ephemeral OS disks are supported and a default OS disk size isn't specified. The default OS disk size might impact the performance or cost of your cluster. You can't change the OS disk size after cluster or node pool creation. This default Ephemeral sizing affects clusters or node pools created in March 2025 or later.

### Managed OS disks

When you create a new cluster or add a new node pool to an existing cluster, the number for vCPUs by default determines the OS disk size. The number of vCPUs is based on the VM SKU. The following table lists the default OS disk size for each VM SKU:

| VM SKU Cores (vCPUs) | Default OS Disk Tier | Provisioned IOPS | Provisioned Throughput (Mbps) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 - 7 | P10/128G | 500 | 100 |
| 8 - 15 | P15/256G | 1100 | 125 |
| 16 - 63 | P20/512G | 2300 | 150 |
| 64+ | P30/1024G | 5000 | 200 |

Important

Default Managed OS disk sizing is only used on new clusters or node pools when Ephemeral OS disks aren't supported and a default OS disk size isn't specified. The default OS disk size might impact the performance or cost of your cluster. You can't change the OS disk size after cluster or node pool creation. We recommend a minimum disk size of 512G if ephemeral OS disk cannot be used. This default Managed sizing affects clusters or node pools created in July 2022 or later.

## Ephemeral OS disk

By default, Azure automatically replicates the operating system disk for a virtual machine to Azure Storage to avoid data loss when the VM is relocated to another host. However, since containers aren't designed to have local state persisted, this behavior offers limited value while providing some drawbacks. These drawbacks include, but aren't limited to, slower node provisioning and higher read/write latency.

By contrast, Ephemeral OS disks are stored only on the host machine, just like a temporary disk. With this configuration, you get lower read/write latency with faster node scaling and cluster upgrades. Therefore, we strongly **recommend using Ephemeral OS disks whenever possible**.

Note

When you don't explicitly request [Azure managed disks](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview) for the OS, AKS defaults to ephemeral OS if possible for a given node pool configuration.

Size requirements and recommendations for ephemeral OS disks are available in the [Azure VM documentation](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks). The following are some general sizing considerations:

If you chose to use the AKS default VM size

[Standard_DS2_v2](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series#dsv2-series)SKU with the default OS disk size of 100 GiB, the default VM size supports ephemeral OS, but only has 86 GiB of cache size. This configuration would default to managed disks if you don't explicitly specify it. If you do request an ephemeral OS, you receive a validation error.If you request the same

[Standard_DS2_v2](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series#dsv2-series)SKU with a 60-GiB OS disk, this configuration would default to ephemeral OS. The requested size of 60 GiB is smaller than the maximum cache size of 86 GiB.If you select the

[Standard_D8s_v3](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series)SKU with 100-GB OS disk, this VM size supports ephemeral OS and has 200 GiB of cache space. If you don't specify the OS disk type, the node pool would receive ephemeral OS by default.

The latest generation of VM series doesn't have a dedicated cache, but only temporary storage. For example, if you selected the [Standard_E2bds_v5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series#ebdsv5-series) VM size with the default OS disk size of 100 GiB, it supports ephemeral OS disks, but only has 75 GB of temporary storage. This configuration would default to managed OS disks if you don't explicitly specify it. If you do request an ephemeral OS disk, you receive a validation error.

If you request the same

[Standard_E2bds_v5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series#ebdsv5-series)VM size with a 60-GiB OS disk, this configuration defaults to ephemeral OS disks. The requested size of 60 GiB is smaller than the maximum temporary storage of 75 GiB.If you select

[Standard_E4bds_v5](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series#ebdsv5-series)SKU with 100-GiB OS disk, this VM size supports ephemeral OS and has 150 GiB of temporary storage. If you don't specify the OS disk type, by default Azure provisions an ephemeral OS disk to the node pool.

### Customer-managed keys

You can manage encryption for your ephemeral OS disk with your own keys on an AKS cluster. For more information, see [Use Customer Managed key with Azure disk on AKS](azure-disk-customer-managed-keys).

## Ephemeral NVMe data disks

Ephemeral NVMe data disks provide high-performance, low-latency storage directly attached to the physical host of your Azure VM. These disks are ideal for workloads that require fast, temporary storage for intermediate data processing, such as caching, scratch space, or high-throughput analytics.

Ephemeral NVMe data disks were initially available only on Azure VM L-series, E-series, and GPU VMs. With the introduction of Azure VM v6 and v7 generations, support for ephemeral NVMe data disks has expanded to a much wider range of VM sizes, including D-series, F-series, H-series, and more. NVMe disks deliver significantly higher IOPS and throughput compared to traditional HDD or SSD options. However, data stored on these disks is temporary and will be lost if the VM is deallocated or redeployed.

To simplify management and provisioning of ephemeral NVMe data disks in AKS, use [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction). Azure Container Storage can automatically detect and orchestrate NVMe data disks, allowing you to create and manage persistent volumes for your Kubernetes workloads with minimal configuration. This approach is recommended for scenarios where high-performance, temporary storage is required, such as:

- High-speed caching layers, such as datasets and checkpoints for AI training, or model files used for AI inference
- High-performance, self-hosted databases that include built-in replication and backup features
- Data-intensive analytics and processing pipelines that require fast, temporary storage
- Temporary scratch space for batch jobs

Important

Ephemeral NVMe data disks are not suitable for storing critical or persistent data. Ensure your application can tolerate data loss and that important data is stored on persistent volumes backed by Azure Disk, Azure Files, or other durable storage options.

For more information on using Azure Container Storage with ephemeral NVMe data disks, see [Use Azure Container Storage with AKS](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/use-container-storage-with-local-disk).

## Volumes

Kubernetes typically treats individual pods as ephemeral, disposable resources. Applications have different approaches available to them for using and persisting data. A *volume* represents a way to store, retrieve, and persist data across pods and through the application lifecycle.

Traditional volumes are created as Kubernetes resources backed by Azure Storage. You can manually create data volumes to be assigned to pods directly or have Kubernetes automatically create them. Data volumes can use: [Azure Disk](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types), [Azure Files](/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-planning), [Azure NetApp Files](/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels), or [Azure Blobs](/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

Note

Depending on the VM SKU you're using, the Azure Disk CSI driver might have a per-node volume limit. For some high performance VMs (for example, 16 cores), the limit is 64 volumes per node. To identify the limit per VM SKU, review the **Max data disks** column for each VM SKU offered. For a list of VM SKUs offered and their corresponding detailed capacity limits, see [General purpose virtual machine sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-general).

To help determine best fit for your workload between Azure Files and Azure NetApp Files, review the information provided in the article [Azure Files and Azure NetApp Files comparison](/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-netapp-comparison).

### Azure Disk

Use [Azure Disk](azure-disk-csi) to create a Kubernetes *DataDisk* resource. Disks types include:

- Premium SSDs (recommended for most workloads)
- Ultra disks
- Standard SSDs
- Standard HDDs

Tip

For most production and development workloads, use Premium SSDs.

Because an Azure Disk is mounted as *ReadWriteOnce*, it's only available to a single node. For storage volumes accessible by pods on multiple nodes simultaneously, use Azure Files.

### Azure Files

Use [Azure Files](azure-files-csi) to mount a Server Message Block (SMB) version 3.1.1 share or Network File System (NFS) version 4.1 share. Azure Files let you share data across multiple nodes and pods and can use:

- Azure Premium storage backed by high-performance SSDs
- Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs

### Azure NetApp Files

- Ultra Storage
- Premium Storage
- Standard Storage

### Azure Blob Storage

Use [Azure Blob Storage](azure-blob-csi) to create a blob storage container and mount it using the NFS v3.0 protocol or BlobFuse.

- Block blobs

### Volume types

Kubernetes volumes represent more than just a traditional disk for storing and retrieving information. Kubernetes volumes can also be used as a way to inject data into a pod for use by its containers.

Common volume types in Kubernetes include:

#### emptyDir

Commonly used as temporary space for a pod. All containers within a pod can access the data on the volume. Data written to this volume type persists only for the lifespan of the pod. Once you delete the pod, the volume is deleted. This volume typically uses the underlying local node disk storage, though it can also exist only in the node's memory.

#### secret

You can use *secret* volumes to inject sensitive data into pods, such as passwords.

- Create a secret using the Kubernetes API.
- Define your pod or deployment and request a specific secret.
- Secrets are only provided to nodes with a scheduled pod that requires them.
- The secret is stored in
*tmpfs*, not written to disk.

- When you delete the last pod on a node requiring a secret, the secret is deleted from the node's tmpfs.
- Secrets are stored within a given namespace and are only accessed by pods within the same namespace.


#### configMap

You can use *configMap* to inject key-value pair properties into pods, such as application configuration information. Define application configuration information as a Kubernetes resource, easily updated and applied to new instances of pods as they're deployed.

Like using a secret:

- Create a ConfigMap using the Kubernetes API.
- Request the ConfigMap when you define a pod or deployment.
- ConfigMaps are stored within a given namespace and are only accessed by pods within the same namespace.


## Persistent volumes

Volumes defined and created as part of the pod lifecycle only exist until you delete the pod. Pods often expect their storage to remain if a pod is rescheduled on a different host during a maintenance event, especially in StatefulSets. A *persistent volume* (PV) is a storage resource created and managed by the Kubernetes API that can exist beyond the lifetime of an individual pod.

You can use the following Azure Storage services to provide the persistent volume:

As noted in the [Volumes](#volumes) section, the choice of Azure Disks or Azure Files is often determined by the need for concurrent access to the data or the performance tier.

A cluster administrator can *statically* create a persistent volume, or a volume can be created *dynamically* by the Kubernetes API server. If a pod is scheduled and requests storage that is currently unavailable, Kubernetes can create the underlying Azure Disk or File storage and attach it to the pod. Dynamic provisioning uses a *storage class* to identify what type of resource needs to be created.

Important

Persistent volumes can't be shared by Windows and Linux pods due to differences in file system support between the two operating systems.

If you want a fully managed solution for block-level access to data, consider using [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction) instead of CSI drivers. Azure Container Storage integrates with Kubernetes, allowing dynamic and automatic provisioning of persistent volumes. Azure Container Storage supports Azure Disks, Ephemeral Disks, and Azure Elastic SAN (preview) as backing storage, offering flexibility and scalability for stateful applications running on Kubernetes clusters.

## Storage classes

To specify different tiers of storage, such as premium or standard, you can create a *storage class*.

A storage class also defines a *reclaim policy*. When you delete the persistent volume, the reclaim policy controls the behavior of the underlying Azure Storage resource. The underlying resource can either be deleted or kept for use with a future pod.

For clusters using [Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction), you'll see an additional storage class called `acstor-<storage-pool-name>`

. An internal storage class is also created.

For clusters using [Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers](csi-storage-drivers), the following extra storage classes are created:

| Storage class | Description |
|---|---|
`managed-csi` |
Uses Azure Standard SSD locally redundant storage (LRS) to create a managed disk. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. The storage class also configures the persistent volumes to be expandable. You can edit the persistent volume claim to specify the new size. Effective starting with Kubernetes version 1.29, in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters deployed across multiple availability zones, this storage class utilizes Azure Standard SSD zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to create managed disks. |
`managed-csi-premium` |
Uses Azure Premium locally redundant storage (LRS) to create a managed disk. The reclaim policy again ensures that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. Similarly, this storage class allows for persistent volumes to be expanded. Effective starting with Kubernetes version 1.29, in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters deployed across multiple availability zones, this storage class utilizes Azure Premium zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to create managed disks. |
`azurefile-csi` |
Uses Azure Standard storage to create an Azure file share. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying Azure file share is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. |
`azurefile-csi-premium` |
Uses Azure Premium storage to create an Azure file share. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying Azure file share is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. |
`azureblob-nfs-premium` |
Uses Azure Premium storage to create an Azure Blob storage container and connect using the NFS v3 protocol. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying Azure Blob storage container is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. |
`azureblob-fuse-premium` |
Uses Azure Premium storage to create an Azure Blob storage container and connect using BlobFuse. The reclaim policy ensures that the underlying Azure Blob storage container is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted. |

Unless you specify a storage class for a persistent volume, the default storage class is used. Ensure volumes use the appropriate storage you need when requesting persistent volumes.

Important

Starting with Kubernetes version 1.21, AKS uses CSI drivers by default, and CSI migration is enabled. While existing in-tree persistent volumes continue to function, starting with version 1.26, AKS will no longer support volumes created using in-tree driver and storage provisioned for files and disk.

The `default`

class will be the same as `managed-csi`

.

Effective starting with Kubernetes version 1.29, when you deploy Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters across multiple availability zones, AKS now utilizes zone-redundant storage (ZRS) to create managed disks within built-in storage classes. ZRS ensures synchronous replication of your Azure managed disks across multiple Azure availability zones in your chosen region. This redundancy strategy enhances the resilience of your applications and safeguards your data against datacenter failures.

However, it's important to note that zone-redundant storage (ZRS) comes at a higher cost compared to locally redundant storage (LRS). If cost optimization is a priority, you can create a new storage class with the `skuname`

parameter set to LRS. You can then use the new storage class in your Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

You can create a storage class for other needs using `kubectl`

. The following example uses premium managed disks and specifies that the underlying Azure Disk should be *retained* when you delete the pod:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
name: managed-premium-retain
provisioner: disk.csi.azure.com
parameters:
skuName: Premium_ZRS
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```


Note

AKS reconciles the default storage classes and will overwrite any changes you make to those storage classes.

For more information about storage classes, see [StorageClass in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).

## Persistent volume claims

A persistent volume claim (PVC) requests storage of a particular storage class, access mode, and size. The Kubernetes API server can dynamically provision the underlying Azure Storage resource if no existing resource can fulfill the claim based on the defined storage class.

The pod definition includes the volume mount once the volume has been connected to the pod.

Once an available storage resource has been assigned to the pod requesting storage, the persistent volume is *bound* to a persistent volume claim. Persistent volumes are mapped to claims in a 1:1 mapping.

The following example YAML manifest shows a persistent volume claim that uses the *managed-premium* storage class and requests an Azure Disk that is *5Gi* in size:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
accessModes:
- ReadWriteOnce
storageClassName: managed-premium-retain
resources:
requests:
storage: 5Gi
```


When you create a pod definition, you also specify:

- The persistent volume claim to request the desired storage.
- The
*volume mount*for your applications to read and write data.

The following example YAML manifest shows how the previous persistent volume claim can be used to mount a volume at */mnt/azure*:

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: nginx
spec:
containers:
- name: myfrontend
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: "/mnt/azure"
name: volume
volumes:
- name: volume
persistentVolumeClaim:
claimName: azure-managed-disk
```


For mounting a volume in a Windows container, specify the drive letter and path. For example:

```
...
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: "d:"
name: volume
- mountPath: "c:\k"
name: k-dir
...
```

# Pod Sandboxing with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To help secure and protect your container workloads from untrusted or potentially malicious code, AKS now includes a mechanism called Pod Sandboxing. Pod Sandboxing provides an isolation boundary between the container application and the shared kernel and compute resources of the container host such as CPU, memory, and networking. Applications are spun up in isolated, lightweight pod virtual machines (VMs). Pod Sandboxing complements other security measures or data protection controls with your overall architecture to help you meet regulatory, industry, or governance compliance requirements for securing sensitive information.

This article helps you understand this new feature, and how to implement it.

## Prerequisites

The Azure CLI version 2.80.0 or later. Run

`az --version`

to find the version of your Azure CLI, and run`az upgrade`

to upgrade. For more details, see the steps at[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).AKS supports Pod Sandboxing on Kubernetes version 1.27.0 and higher.

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client

[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). Azure Cloud Shell comes with`kubectl`

. You can install kubectl locally using the[az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli)command.

## Limitations

The following are constraints applicable to Pod Sandboxing:

Kata containers might not reach the IOPS performance limits that traditional containers can reach on Azure Files and high-performance local SSD.

[Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction)doesn't support assessing Kata runtime pods.[Kata](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/Limitations.md#host-network)host-network access isn't supported. It isn't possible to directly access the host networking configuration from within the VM.CPU and memory allocation with Pod Sandboxing has other considerations compared to

`runc`

. Reference the memory management sections in the[considerations page](considerations-pod-sandboxing).

## How it works

Pod Sandboxing on AKS builds on top of the open-source [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) project. Kata Containers running on the Azure Linux container host for AKS provides VM based isolation and a separate kernel for each pod. Pod Sandboxing allows users to allocate resources for each pod and doesn't share them with other Kata Containers or namespace containers running on the same host.

The solution architecture is based on the following main components:

- The
[Azure Linux container host for AKS](use-azure-linux) - Microsoft Hyper-V Hypervisor
- Open-source
[Cloud-Hypervisor](https://www.cloudhypervisor.org)Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) - Integration with
[Kata Container](https://katacontainers.io)for the runtime

Deploying Pod Sandboxing using Kata Containers is similar to the standard `containerd`

workflow to deploy containers. Clusters with Pod Sandboxing enabled come with a specific runtime class that can be referenced in a pod manifest (`runtimeClassName: kata-vm-isolation`

).

To use this feature with a pod, the only difference is to add the **runtimeClassName**, `kata-vm-isolation`

to the pod spec. When a pod uses the `kata-vm-isolation`

runtimeClass, the hypervisor spins up a lightweight virtual machine with its own kernel, for the workload to operate in.

## Deploy new cluster

Perform the following steps to deploy an Azure Linux AKS cluster using the Azure CLI.

Create an AKS cluster using the

[az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create)command and specifying the following parameters:**--workload-runtime**: Specify*KataVmIsolation*to enable the Pod Sandboxing feature on the node pool. With this parameter, these other parameters should satisfy the following requirements. Otherwise, the command fails and reports an issue with the corresponding parameters.**--os-sku**:*AzureLinux*. Only the Azure Linux os-sku supports this feature.**--node-vm-size**: Any Azure VM size that is a generation 2 VM and supports nested virtualization works. For example,[Dsv3](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series)VMs.

The following example creates a cluster named

*myAKSCluster*with one node in the*myResourceGroup*:`az aks create --name myAKSCluster \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --os-sku AzureLinux \ --workload-runtime KataVmIsolation \ --node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3 \ --node-count 3 \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Run the following command to get access credentials for the Kubernetes cluster. Use the

[az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials)command and replace the values for the cluster name and the resource group name.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

List all Pods in all namespaces using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`


## Deploy to an existing cluster

To use this feature with an existing AKS cluster, the following requirements must be met:

- Verify the cluster is running Kubernetes version 1.27.0 and higher.

Use the following command to enable Pod Sandboxing by creating a node pool to host it.

Add a node pool to your AKS cluster using the

[az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add)command. Specify the following parameters:**--resource-group**: Enter the name of an existing resource group to create the AKS cluster in.**--cluster-name**: Enter a unique name for the AKS cluster, such as*myAKSCluster*.**--name**: Enter a unique name for your clusters node pool, such as*nodepool2*.**--workload-runtime**: Specify*KataVmIsolation*to enable the Pod Sandboxing feature on the node pool. Along with the`--workload-runtime`

parameter, these other parameters shall satisfy the following requirements. Otherwise, the command fails and reports an issue with the corresponding parameter.**--os-sku**:*AzureLinux*. Only the Azure Linux os-sku supports this feature.**--node-vm-size**: Any Azure VM size that is a generation 2 VM and supports nested virtualization works. For example,[Dsv3](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series)VMs.


The following example adds a node pool to

*myAKSCluster*with one node in*nodepool2*in the*myResourceGroup*:`az aks nodepool add --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --name nodepool2 --os-sku AzureLinux --workload-runtime KataVmIsolation --node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3`

Run the

[az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update)command to enable pod sandboxing on the cluster.`az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`


## Deploying your applications

With Pod Sandboxing, you can deploy a mix of "normal" pods that don't utilize the Kata runtime alongside Kata pods that do utilize the runtime. The main difference between the two, when deploying, lies in the fact that a Kata pod has the line `runtimeClassName: kata-vm-isolation`

in its spec.

### Deploy an application with the Kata runtime

To deploy a pod with the Kata runtime on your AKS cluster, perform the following steps.

Create a file named

*kata-app.yaml*to describe your kata pod, and then paste the following manifest.`kind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: isolated-pod spec: runtimeClassName: kata-vm-isolation containers: - name: kata image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/fundamental/base-ubuntu:v0.0.11 command: ["/bin/sh", "-ec", "while :; do echo '.'; sleep 5 ; done"]`

The value for

**runtimeClassNameSpec**is`kata-vm-isolation`

.Deploy the Kubernetes pod by running the

[kubectl apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#apply)command and specify your*kata-app.yaml*file:`kubectl apply -f kata-app.yaml`

The output of the command resembles the following example:

`pod/isolated-pod created`


## (Optional) Verify Kernel Isolation configuration

If you would like to verify the difference between the kernel of a Kata and non-Kata pod, you can spin up another workload that doesn't have the Kata runtime.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: normal-pod
spec:
containers:
- name: non-kata
image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/fundamental/base-ubuntu:v0.0.11
command: ["/bin/sh", "-ec", "while :; do echo '.'; sleep 5 ; done"]
```


To access a container inside the AKS cluster, start a shell session by running the

[kubectl exec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec)command. In this example, you're accessing the container inside*kata-pod*.`kubectl exec -it isolated-pod -- /bin/sh`

Kubectl connects to your cluster, runs

`/bin/sh`

inside the first container within`isolated-pod`

, and forwards your terminal's input and output streams to the container's process. You can also start a shell session to the container hosting the non-Kata pod to see the differences.After starting a shell session to the container from

*kata-pod*, you can run commands to verify that the*kata*container is running in a pod sandbox. Notice that it has a different kernel version compared to the non-Kata container outside the sandbox.To see the kernel version run the following command:

`uname -r`

The following example resembles output from the pod sandbox kernel:

`[user]/# uname -r 6.6.96.mshv1`

Start a shell session to the container from

*normal-pod*to verify the kernel output:`kubectl exec -it normal-pod -- /bin/bash`

To see the kernel version run the following command:

`uname -r`

The following example resembles output from the VM that's running

*normal-pod*, which is a different kernel than the Kata pod running within the pod sandbox:`6.6.100.mshv1-1.azl3`


## Cleanup

When you're finished evaluating this feature, to avoid Azure charges, clean up your unnecessary resources. If you deployed a new cluster as part of your evaluation or testing, you can delete the cluster using the [az aks delete](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-delete) command.

```
az aks delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```


If you deployed Pod Sandboxing on an existing cluster, you can remove the pods using the [kubectl delete pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#delete) command.

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod <kata-pod-name>
```

# Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) is a lightweight, extensible, cloud native service mesh that allows you to uniformly manage, secure, and get out-of-the-box observability features for highly dynamic microservice environments.

OSM runs an Envoy-based control plane on Kubernetes and can be configured with [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) APIs. OSM works by injecting an Envoy proxy as a sidecar container with each instance of your application. The Envoy proxy contains and executes rules around access control policies, implements routing configuration, and captures metrics. The control plane continually configures the Envoy proxies to ensure policies and routing rules are up to date and proxies are healthy.

Microsoft started the OSM project, but it's now governed by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

Important

Starting on **September 30, 2027**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on. The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) retired the upstream OSM project. [Migrate any existing OSM configurations to equivalent Istio configurations](/en-us/azure/aks/open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance). For more information on this retirement, see the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

## Enable the OSM add-on

OSM can be added to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by enabling the OSM add-on using the [Azure CLI](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-az-cli) or a [Bicep template](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-bicep). The OSM add-on provides a fully supported installation of OSM that's integrated with AKS.

Important

Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.

| Kubernetes version | OSM version installed |
|---|---|
| 1.24.0 or greater | 1.2.5 |
| Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3 |
| Below 1.23.5 | 1.0.0 |

Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

## Capabilities and features

OSM provides the following capabilities and features:

- Secure service-to-service communication by enabling mutual TLS (mTLS).
- Onboard applications onto the OSM mesh using automatic sidecar injection of Envoy proxy.
- Transparently configure traffic shifting on deployments.
- Define and execute fine-grained access control policies for services.
- Monitor and debug services using observability and insights into application metrics.
- Encrypt communications between service endpoints deployed in the cluster.
- Enable traffic authorization of both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic.
- Configure weighted traffic controls between two or more services for A/B testing or canary deployments.
- Collect and view KPIs from application traffic.
- Integrate with external certificate management.
- Integrate with existing ingress solutions such as
[NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx),[Contour](https://projectcontour.io/), and[Application Routing](app-routing).

For more information on ingress and OSM, see [Using ingress to manage external access to services within the cluster](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/ingress/) and [Integrate OSM with Contour for ingress](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/demos/ingress_contour). For an example of how to integrate OSM with ingress controllers using the `networking.k8s.io/v1`

API, see [Ingress with Kubernetes Nginx ingress controller](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/demos/ingress_k8s_nginx). For more information on using Application Routing, which automatically integrates with OSM, see [Application Routing](app-routing).

## Limitations

The OSM AKS add-on has the following limitations:

- After installation, you must enable Iptables redirection for port IP address and port range exclusion using
`kubectl patch`

. For more information, see[iptables redirection](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/iptables_redirection/). - Any pods that need access to IMDS, Azure DNS, or the Kubernetes API server must have their IP addresses added to the global list of excluded outbound IP ranges using
[Global outbound IP range exclusions](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/traffic_management/iptables_redirection/#global-outbound-ip-range-exclusions).

- The add-on doesn't work on AKS clusters that are using
[Istio based service mesh addon for AKS](istio-about).

- OSM doesn't support Windows Server containers.

## Next steps

After enabling the OSM add-on using the [Azure CLI](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-az-cli) or a [Bicep template](open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-bicep), you can:

# Monitor the ingress-nginx controller metrics in the application routing add-on with Prometheus and Grafana

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The ingress-nginx controller in the application routing add-on exposes many metrics for requests, the nginx process, and the controller that can be helpful in analyzing the performance and usage of your application.

The application routing add-on exposes the Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics`

on port 10254 and a private Service `nginx-metrics`

.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with the
[application routing add-on enabled](/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing). - A Prometheus instance, such as Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.

## Validating the metrics endpoint

To validate the metrics are being collected, you can set up a port forward from a local port to port 10254 on the `nginx-metrics`

service.

```
kubectl port-forward -n app-routing-system service/nginx-metrics :10254
```


```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:43307 -> 10254
Forwarding from [::1]:43307 -> 10254
```


Note the local port (`43307`

in this case) and open http://localhost:43307/metrics in your browser. You should see the ingress-nginx controller metrics loading.

You can now terminate the `port-forward`

process to close the forwarding.

## Configuring Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus

Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible service that supports industry standard features such as PromQL, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus alerts. This service requires configuring the metrics addon for the Azure Monitor agent, which sends data to Prometheus. If your cluster isn't configured with the add-on, you can follow this article to configure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to send data to Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus.

### Enable Service Monitor based scraping

Once your cluster is updated with the Azure Monitor agent, you need to configure the agent to enable scraping the metrics endpoint. You can [create a Pod or a Service Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-crd) to accomplish this.

The following creates a Service Monitor scrape metrics from the ingress-nginx controller deployed by the application routing add-on.

```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
name: nginx-monitor
namespace: app-routing-system
spec:
labelLimit: 63
labelNameLengthLimit: 511
labelValueLengthLimit: 1023
selector:
matchLabels:
app.kubernetes.io/component: ingress-controller
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: aks-app-routing-operator
app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
endpoints:
- port: prometheus
EOF
```


In a few minutes, the `ama-metrics`

pods in the `kube-system`

namespace should restart and pick up the new configuration.

## Review visualization of metrics in Azure Managed Grafana

Now that you have Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana configured, you should [access your Managed Grafana instance](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-portal#access-your-managed-grafana-instance).

There are two [official ingress-nginx dashboards](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards) dashboards that you can download and import into your Grafana instance:

- Ingress-nginx controller dashboard
- Request handling performance dashboard

### Ingress-nginx controller dashboard

This dashboard gives you visibility of request volume, connections, success rates, config reloads and configs out of sync. You can also use it to view the network IO pressure, memory and CPU use of the ingress controller. Finally, it also shows the P50, P95, and P99 percentile response times of your ingresses and their throughput.

You can download this dashboard from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards/nginx.json).

### Request handling performance dashboard

This dashboard gives you visibility into the request handling performance of the different ingress upstream destinations, which are your applications' endpoints that the ingress controller is forwarding traffic to. It shows the P50, P95 and P99 percentile of total request and upstream response times. You can also view aggregates of request errors and latency. Use this dashboard to review and improve the performance and scalability of your applications.

You can download this dashboard from [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/grafana/dashboards/request-handling-performance.json).

### Importing a dashboard

To import a Grafana dashboard, expand the left menu and click on **Import** under Dashboards.

Then upload the desired dashboard file and click on **Load**.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to set up Advanced Container Networking Services with Container Network Security feature in AKS clusters.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin.

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


The minimum version of Azure CLI required for the steps in this article is 2.71.0. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations:

- Wildcard FQDN policies are partially supported. This means you can create policies that match specific patterns with a leading wildcard (for example,
*.example.com), but you can't use a universal wildcard (*) to match all domains on the field`spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`


Supported Pattern:

`*.example.com`

- This allows traffic to all subdomains under example.com.`app*.example.com`

- This rule is more specific and only allows traffic to subdomains that start with "app" under example.comUnsupported Pattern

`*`

This attempt to match any domain name, which isn't supported.

- FQDN filtering is currently not supported with node-local DNS.
- Kubernetes service names aren't supported.
- Other L7 policies aren't supported.
- FQDN pods might exhibit performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 requests per second.
- If Advanced Container Networking Services(ACNS) security is disabled, FQDN and L7 policies (HTTP, HTTPS, Kafka, and gRPC) will be blocked.
- Alpine-based container images might encounter DNS resolution issues when used with Cilium Network Policies. This is due to musl libc's limited search domain iteration. To work around this, explicitly define all search domains in the Network Policy's DNS rules using wildcard patterns, like the below example

```
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*"
- matchPattern: "*.example.com.*.*.*.*.*"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.example.com"
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services

To proceed, you must have an AKS cluster with [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) enabled.

The `az aks create`

command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag, `--enable-acns`

, creates a new AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features. These features encompass:

**Container Network Observability:**Provides insights into your network traffic. To learn more visit[Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability).**Container Network Security:**Offers security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering. To learn more visit[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security).

```
# Set an environment variable for the AKS cluster name. Make sure to replace the placeholder with your own value.
export CLUSTER_NAME="<aks-cluster-name>"
# Create an AKS cluster
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--location eastus \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--node-count 2 \
--enable-acns
```


### Enable Advanced Container Networking Services on an existing cluster

The [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command with the Advanced Container Networking Services flag,

`--enable-acns`

, updates an existing AKS cluster with all Advanced Container Networking Services features which includes [Container Network Observability](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-observability)and the

[Container Network Security](advanced-container-networking-services-overview?tabs=cilium#container-network-security)feature

Note

Only clusters with the Cilium data plane support Container Network Security features of Advanced Container Networking Services.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--enable-acns
```


## Get cluster credentials

Get your cluster credentials using the [ az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP
```


## Test connectivity with a policy

This section demonstrates how to observe a policy being enforced through the Cilium Agent. A DNS request is made to an allowed FQDN and another case where it's blocked.

Create a file named `demo-policy.yaml`

and paste the following YAML manifest:

Note

The field `spec.egress.toPorts.rules.dns.matchPattern`

is **mandatory** when using to FQDNs in a policy. This section tells Cilium to inspect DNS queries and match them against specified patterns. Without this section, Cilium only allows the DNS traffic and not inspect its contents to learn which IPs are associated with the FQDNs. As a result, connections to those IPs (i.e., non-DNS traffic) are blocked because Cilium can't associate them with the allowed domain.

Make sure to check the [limitations](#limitations) section first.

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: "allow-bing-fqdn"
spec:
endpointSelector:
matchLabels:
app: demo-container
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


Specify the name of your YAML manifest and apply it by using [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply]:

```
kubectl create ns demo
kubectl apply -f demo-policy.yaml -n demo
```


### Create a demo pod

Create a `client`

pod running Bash:

```
kubectl run -it client -n demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.43 --labels="app=demo-container" --command -- bash
```


A shell with utilities for testing FQDN should open with the following output:

```
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
bash-5.0#
```


In a separate window, run the following command to get the node of the running pod.

```
kubectl get po -n demo --sort-by="{spec.nodeName}" -o wide
```


The output should look similar to the following example:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES
client 1/1 Running 0 5m50s 192.168.0.139 aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001 <none> <none>
```


The pod is running on a node named `aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001`

. Obtain the Cilium Agent instance running on that node:

```
kubectl get po -n kube-system -o wide --field-selector spec.nodeName="aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001" | grep "cilium"
```


The expected `cilium-s4x24`

should be in the output.

```
cilium-s4x24 1/1 Running 0 47m 10.224.0.4 aks-nodepool1-22058664-vmss000001 <none> <none>
```


### Inspect a Cilium Agent

Use the `cilium`

CLI to monitor traffic being blocked.

```
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system cilium-s4x24 -- sh
```


```
Defaulted container "cilium-agent" out of: cilium-agent, install-cni-binaries (init), mount-cgroup (init), apply-sysctl-overwrites (init), mount-bpf-fs (init), clean-cilium-state (init), block-wireserver (init)
#
```


Inside this shell, run `cilium monitor -t drop`

:

```
Listening for events on 2 CPUs with 64x4096 of shared memory
Press Ctrl-C to quit
time="2024-10-08T17:48:27Z" level=info msg="Initializing dissection cache..." subsys=monitor
```


### Verify policy

From the first shell, create a request to the allowed FQDN, `*.bing.com`

, as specified by the policy. This request should succeed and allowed by the agent.

```
./agnhost connect www.bing.com:80
```


Then create another request to an FQDN expected to be blocked:

```
./agnhost connect www.example.com:80
```


Cilium Agent blocked the request with the output:

```
xx drop (Policy denied) flow 0xfddd76f6 to endpoint 0, ifindex 29, file bpf_lxc.c:1274, , identity 48447->world: 192.168.0.149:45830 -> 93.184.215.14:80 tcp SYN
```


### Supported by CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy(CCNP)

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

supports FQDN filtering.

Note

[Namespace specific information](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/kubernetes/#namespace-specific-information) such as `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`

is only supported in cluster-wide policies.

```
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: allow-bing-fqdn
spec:
endpointSelector: {} # Applies to all pods in the cluster
egress:
- toEndpoints:
- matchLabels:
"k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace": kube-system
"k8s:k8s-app": kube-dns
toPorts:
- ports:
- port: "53"
protocol: ANY
rules:
dns:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
- toFQDNs:
- matchPattern: "*.bing.com"
```


## Clean up resources

If you don't plan on using this application, delete the other resources you created in this article using the [ az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/#az-group-delete) command.

```
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

# Customize cluster egress with outbound types in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

Starting on **March 31, 2026**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports default outbound access for virtual machines (VMs). New AKS clusters that use the **AKS-managed virtual network** option will place cluster subnets into [private subnets](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access#why-is-disabling-default-outbound-access-recommended) by default (`defaultOutboundAccess = false`

). This setting **doesn't impact AKS-managed cluster traffic**, which uses explicitly configured outbound paths. It might affect **unsupported scenarios**, such as deploying other resources into the same subnet. Clusters using **BYO VNets are unaffected** by this change. In supported configurations, no action is required. For more information on this retirement, see the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=default-outbound-access-for-vms-in-azure-will-be-retired-transition-to-a-new-method-of-internet-access). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

You can customize egress for an AKS cluster to fit specific scenarios. By default, AKS creates a Standard Load Balancer to be set up and used for egress. However, the default setup may not meet the requirements of all scenarios if public IPs are disallowed or extra hops are required for egress.

This article covers the various types of outbound connectivity that are available in AKS clusters.

Note

You can now update the `outboundType`

after cluster creation.

Important

In nonprivate clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Limitations

- Setting
`outboundType`

requires AKS clusters with a`vm-set-type`

of`VirtualMachineScaleSets`

and`load-balancer-sku`

of`Standard`

.

## Outbound types in AKS

You can configure an AKS cluster using the following outbound types: load balancer, NAT gateway, or user-defined routing. The outbound type impacts only the egress traffic of your cluster. For more information, see [setting up ingress controllers](ingress-basic).

### Outbound type of `loadBalancer`


The load balancer is used for egress through an AKS-assigned public IP. An outbound type of `loadBalancer`

supports Kubernetes services of type `loadBalancer`

, which expect egress out of the load balancer created by the AKS resource provider.

If `loadBalancer`

is set, AKS automatically completes the following configuration:

- A public IP address is created for cluster egress.
- The public IP address is assigned to the load balancer resource.
- Backend pools for the load balancer are set up for agent nodes in the cluster.

For more information, see [using a standard load balancer in AKS](load-balancer-standard).

### Outbound type of `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`


If `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`

are selected for `outboundType`

, AKS relies on [Azure Networking NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/manage-nat-gateway) for cluster egress.

- Select
`managedNatGateway`

when using managed virtual networks. AKS provisions a NAT gateway and attach it to the cluster subnet. - Select
`userAssignedNatGateway`

when using bring-your-own virtual networking. This option requires that you have a NAT gateway created before cluster creation.

For more information, see [using NAT gateway with AKS](nat-gateway).

### Outbound type of `userDefinedRouting`


Note

The `userDefinedRouting`

outbound type is an advanced networking scenario and requires proper network configuration.

If `userDefinedRouting`

is set, AKS doesn't automatically configure egress paths. The egress setup is completed by you.

You must deploy the AKS cluster into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is configured. Since you're not using a standard load balancer (SLB) architecture, you must establish explicit egress. This architecture requires explicitly sending egress traffic to an appliance like a firewall, gateway, proxy or to allow NAT to be done by a public IP assigned to the standard load balancer or appliance.

For more information, see [configuring cluster egress via user-defined routing](egress-udr).

### Outbound type of `none`


Important

The `none`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure the cluster operates as expected without unintended dependencies on external services. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `none`

is set, AKS won't automatically configure egress paths. This option is similar to `userDefinedRouting`

but does **not** require a default route as part of validation.

The `none`

outbound type is supported in both bring-your-own (BYO) virtual network scenarios and managed VNet scenarios. However, you must ensure that the AKS cluster is deployed into a network environment where explicit egress paths are defined if needed. For BYO VNet scenarios, the cluster must be deployed into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is already configured. Since AKS doesn't create a standard load balancer or any egress infrastructure, you must establish explicit egress paths if needed. Egress options can include routing traffic to a firewall, proxy, gateway, or other custom network configurations.

### Outbound type of `block`

(Preview)

Important

The `block`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure no unintended network dependencies exist. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `block`

is set, AKS configures network rules to **actively block all egress traffic** from the cluster. This option is useful for highly secure environments where outbound connectivity must be restricted.

When using `block`

:

- AKS ensures that no public internet traffic can leave the cluster through network security group (NSG) rules. VNet traffic isn't affected.
- You must explicitly allow any required egress traffic through extra network configurations.

The `block`

option provides another level of network isolation but requires careful planning to avoid breaking workloads or dependencies.

## Updating `outboundType`

after cluster creation

Changing the outbound type after cluster creation deploys or removes resources as required to put the cluster into the new egress configuration.

The following tables show the supported migration paths between outbound types for managed and BYO virtual networks.

### Supported Migration Paths for Managed VNet

Each row shows whether the outbound type can be migrated to the types listed across the top. "Supported" means migration is possible, while "Not Supported" or "N/A" means it isn't.

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported |
`block` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A |

### Supported Migration Paths for BYO VNet

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`userDefinedRouting` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A | Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | N/A | Not Supported |

Migration is only supported between `loadBalancer`

, `managedNATGateway`

(if using a managed virtual network), `userAssignedNATGateway`

and `userDefinedRouting`

(if using a custom virtual network).

Warning

Migrating the outbound type to user managed types (`userAssignedNATGateway`

or `userDefinedRouting`

) will change the outbound public IP addresses of the cluster.
if [Authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges) is enabled, ensure new outbound IP range is appended to authorized IP range.

Warning

Changing the outbound type on a cluster is disruptive to network connectivity and results in a change of the cluster's egress IP address. If any firewall rules are configured to restrict traffic from the cluster, you need to update them to match the new egress IP address.

### Update cluster to use a new outbound type

Note

You must use a version >= 2.56 of Azure CLI to migrate outbound type. Use `az upgrade`

to update to the latest version of Azure CLI.

- Update the outbound configuration of your cluster using the
command.`az aks update`


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to managedNATGateway

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type managedNATGateway --nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>
```


### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to loadbalancer

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> \
--outbound-type loadBalancer \
<--load-balancer-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>| --load-balancer-outbound-ips <outbound ip ids> | --load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes <outbound ip prefix ids> >
```


Warning

Don't reuse an IP address that is already in use in prior outbound configurations.

### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to userDefinedRouting

- Add route
`0.0.0.0/0`

default route table. Please see[Customize cluster egress with a user-defined routing table in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](egress-udr)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userDefinedRouting
```


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to userAssignedNATGateway in BYO vnet scenario

- Associate nat gateway with subnet where the workload is associated with. Refer to
[Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway](nat-gateway)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway
```
