Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which is based on the open source [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) version.

When configured, the VPA automatically sets resource requests and limits on containers per workload based on past usage. The VPA frees up CPU and Memory for other pods and helps ensure effective utilization of your AKS clusters. The Vertical Pod Autoscaler provides recommendations for resource usage over time. To manage sudden increases in resource usage, use the [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler), which scales the number of pod replicas as needed.

## Benefits

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler offers the following benefits:

- Analyzes and adjusts processor and memory resources to
*right size*your applications. VPA isn't only responsible for scaling up, but also for scaling down based on their resource use over time. - A pod with a scaling mode set to
*auto*or*recreate*is evicted if it needs to change its resource requests. - You can set CPU and memory constraints for individual containers by specifying a resource policy.
- Ensures nodes have correct resources for pod scheduling.
- Offers configurable logging of any adjustments made to processor or memory resources made.
- Improves cluster resource utilization and frees up CPU and memory for other pods.

## Limitations and considerations

Consider the following limitations and considerations when using the Vertical Pod Autoscaler:

- VPA supports a maximum of 1,000 pods associated with
`VerticalPodAutoscaler`

objects per cluster. - VPA might recommend more resources than available in the cluster, which prevents the pod from being assigned to a node and run due to insufficient resources. You can overcome this limitation by setting the
*LimitRange*to the maximum available resources per namespace, which ensures pods don't ask for more resources than specified. You can also set maximum allowed resource recommendations per pod in a`VerticalPodAutoscaler`

object. The VPA can't completely overcome an insufficient node resource issue. The limit range is fixed, but the node resource usage is changed dynamically. - We don't recommend using VPA with the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler), which scales based on the same CPU and memory usage metrics. - The VPA Recommender only stores up to
*eight days*of historical data. - VPA doesn't support JVM-based workloads due to limited visibility into actual memory usage of the workload.
- VPA doesn't support running your own implementation of VPA alongside it. Having an extra or customized recommender is supported.
- AKS Windows containers aren't supported.

## VPA overview

The VPA object consists of three components:

**Recommender**: The Recommender monitors current and past resource consumption, including metric history, Out of Memory (OOM) events, and VPA deployment specs, and uses the information it gathers to provide recommended values for container CPU and Memory requests/limits.**Updater**: The Updater monitors managed pods to ensure that their resource requests are set correctly. If not, it removes those pods so that their controllers can recreate them with the updated requests.**VPA Admission Controller**: The VPA Admission Controller sets the correct resource requests on new pods either created or recreated by their controller based on the Updater's activity.

### VPA admission controller

The VPA Admission Controller is a binary that registers itself as a *Mutating Admission Webhook*. When a new pod is created, the VPA Admission Controller gets a request from the API server and evaluates if there's a matching VPA configuration or finds a corresponding one and uses the current recommendation to set resource requests in the pod.

A standalone job, `overlay-vpa-cert-webhook-check`

, runs outside of the VPA Admission Controller. The `overlay-vpa-cert-webhook-check`

job creates and renews the certificates and registers the VPA Admission Controller as a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`

.

### VPA object operation modes

A Vertical Pod Autoscaler resource, most commonly a *deployment*, is inserted for each controller that you want to have automatically computed resource requirements.

There are four modes in which the VPA operates:

`Auto`

: VPA assigns resource requests during pod creation and updates existing pods using the preferred update mechanism.`Auto`

, which is equivalent to`Recreate`

, is the default mode. Once restart-free, or*in-place*, updates of pod requests are available, it can be used as the preferred update mechanism by the`Auto`

mode. With the`Auto`

mode, VPA evicts a pod if it needs to change its resource requests. It might cause the pods to be restarted all at once, which can cause application inconsistencies. You can limit restarts and maintain consistency in this situation using a[PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/).`Recreate`

: VPA assigns resource requests during pod creation and updates existing pods by evicting them when the requested resources differ significantly from the new recommendations (respecting the PodDisruptionBudget, if defined). You should only use this mode if you need to ensure that the pods are restarted whenever the resource request changes. Otherwise, we recommend using`Auto`

mode, which takes advantage of restart-free updates once available.`Initial`

: VPA only assigns resource requests during pod creation. It doesn't update existing pods. This mode is useful for testing and understanding the VPA behavior without affecting the running pods.`Off`

: VPA doesn't automatically change the resource requirements of the pods. The recommendations are calculated and can be inspected in the VPA object.

## Deployment pattern for application development

If you're unfamiliar with VPA, we recommend the following deployment pattern during application development to identify its unique resource utilization characteristics, test VPA to verify it's functioning properly, and test alongside other Kubernetes components to optimize resource utilization of the cluster:

- Set
`UpdateMode = "Off"`

in your production cluster and run VPA in recommendation mode so you can test and gain familiarity with VPA.`UpdateMode = "Off"`

can avoid introducing a misconfiguration that can cause an outage. - Establish observability first by collecting actual resource utilization telemetry over a given period of time, which helps you understand the behavior and any signs of issues from container and pod resources influenced by the workloads running on them.
- Get familiar with the monitoring data to understand the performance characteristics. Based on this insight, set the desired requests/limits accordingly and then in the next deployment or upgrade.
- Set
`updateMode`

value to`Auto`

,`Recreate`

, or`Initial`

depending on your requirements.

# Active-passive disaster recovery solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. When the region becomes unavailable during a disaster, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

This guide outlines an active-passive disaster recovery solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with only one cluster actively serving traffic.

Note

The following practice has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Active-passive solution overview

In this disaster recovery approach, we have two independent AKS clusters being deployed in two Azure regions. However, only one of the clusters is actively serving traffic at any one time. The secondary cluster (not actively serving traffic) contains the same configuration and application data as the primary cluster but doesn’t accept any traffic unless directed by Azure Front Door traffic manager.

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented when hosting applications reliant on resources, such as databases, that actively serve traffic in one region. In scenarios where you need to host stateless applications deployed across both regions, such as horizontal scaling, we recommend considering an [active-active solution](active-active-solution), as active-passive involves added latency.

## Components

The active-passive disaster recovery solution uses many Azure services. This example architecture involves the following components:

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. During normal operations, network traffic is routed to the primary AKS cluster set in the Azure Front Door configuration.

**Configured cluster prioritization**: You set a prioritization level between 1-5 for each cluster (with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority). You can set multiple clusters to the same priority level and specify the weight for each cluster. If the primary cluster becomes unavailable, traffic automatically routes to the next region selected in Azure Front Door. All traffic must go through Azure Front Door for this system to work.

**Azure Front Door**: [Azure Front Door](/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) load balances and routes traffic to the [Azure Application Gateway](/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) instance in the primary region (cluster must be marked with priority 1). In the event of a region failure, the service redirects traffic to the next cluster in the priority list.

For more information, see [Priority-based traffic-routing](/en-us/azure/frontdoor/routing-methods#priority-based-traffic-routing).

**Hub-spoke pair**: A hub-spoke pair is deployed for each regional AKS instance. [Azure Firewall Manager](/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/overview) policies manage the firewall rules across each region.

**Key Vault**: You provision an [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in each region to store secrets and keys.

**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

**Container Registry**: The container images for the workload are stored in a managed container registry. With this solution, a single [Azure Container Registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) instance is used for all Kubernetes instances in the cluster. Geo-replication for Azure Container Registry enables you to replicate images to the selected Azure regions and provides continued access to images even if a region experiences an outage.

## Failover process

If a service or service component becomes unavailable in one region, traffic should be routed to a region where that service is available. A multi-region architecture includes many different failure points. In this section, we cover the potential failure points.

### Application Pods (Regional)

A Kubernetes deployment object creates multiple replicas of a pod (*ReplicaSet*). If one is unavailable, traffic is routed between the remaining replicas. The Kubernetes *ReplicaSet* attempts to keep the specified number of replicas up and running. If one instance goes down, a new instance should be recreated. [Liveness probes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe) can check the state of the application or process running in the pod. If the pod is unresponsive, the liveness probe removes the pod, which forces the *ReplicaSet* to create a new instance.

For more information, see [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

### Application Pods (Global)

When an entire region becomes unavailable, the pods in the cluster are no longer available to serve requests. In this case, the Azure Front Door instance routes all traffic to the remaining health regions. The Kubernetes clusters and pods in these regions continue to serve requests. To compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster, keep in mind the following guidance:

- Make sure network and compute resources are right sized to absorb any sudden increase in traffic due to region failover. For example, when using Azure Container Network Interface (CNI), make sure you have a subnet that can support all pod IPs with a spiked traffic load.
- Use the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler)to increase the pod replica count to compensate for the increased regional demand. - Use the AKS
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to increase the Kubernetes instance node counts to compensate for the increased regional demand.

### Kubernetes node pools (Regional)

Occasionally, localized failure can occur to compute resources, such as power becoming unavailable in a single rack of Azure servers. To protect your AKS nodes from becoming a single point regional failure, use [Azure Availability Zones](availability-zones). Availability zones ensure that AKS nodes in each availability zone are physically separated from those defined in another availability zones.

### Kubernetes node pools (Global)

In a complete regional failure, Azure Front Door routes traffic to the remaining healthy regions. Again, make sure to compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster.

## Failover testing strategy

While there are no mechanisms currently available within AKS to take down an entire region of deployment for testing purposes, [Azure Chaos Studio](/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-overview) offers the ability to create a chaos experiment on your cluster.
