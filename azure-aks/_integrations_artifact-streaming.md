Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides extra functionality for your clusters using add-ons and extensions. Open-source projects and third parties provide by more integrations that are commonly used with AKS. The [AKS support policy](support-policies) doesn't support the open-source and third-party integrations.

## Add-ons

Add-ons are a fully supported way to provide extra capabilities for your AKS cluster. The installation, configuration, and lifecycle of add-ons are managed on AKS. You can use the [ az aks enable-addons](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-enable-addons) command to install an add-on or manage the add-ons for your cluster.

AKS uses the following rules for applying updates to installed add-ons:

- Only an add-on's patch version can be upgraded within a Kubernetes minor version. The add-on's major/minor version isn't upgraded within the same Kubernetes minor version.
- The major/minor version of the add-on is only upgraded when moving to a later Kubernetes minor version.
- Any breaking or behavior changes to the add-on are announced well before, usually 60 days, for a GA minor version of Kubernetes on AKS.
- You can patch add-ons weekly with every new release of AKS, which is announced in the release notes. You can control AKS releases using the
[maintenance windows](planned-maintenance)and[release tracker](release-tracker).

### Exceptions

- Add-ons are upgraded to a new major/minor version (or breaking change) within a Kubernetes minor version if either the cluster's Kubernetes version or the add-on version are in preview.
- There can be unavoidable circumstances, such as CVE security patches or critical bug fixes, when you need to update an add-on within a GA minor version.

### Available add-ons

Cluster extensions build on top of certain Helm charts and provide an Azure Resource Manager-driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of different Azure capabilities on top of your Kubernetes cluster.

- For more information on the specific cluster extensions for AKS, see
[Deploy and manage cluster extensions for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-extensions?tabs=azure-cli). - For more information on available cluster extensions, see
[Currently available extensions](cluster-extensions?tabs=azure-cli#currently-available-extensions).

### Difference between extensions and add-ons

Extensions and add-ons are both supported ways to add functionality to your AKS cluster. When you install an add-on, the functionality is added as part of the AKS resource provider in the Azure API. When you install an extension, the functionality is added as part of a separate resource provider in the Azure API.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows from within GitHub.

- For more information on using GitHub Actions with Azure, see
[GitHub Actions for Azure](/en-us/azure/developer/github/github-actions). - For an example of using GitHub Actions with an AKS cluster, see
[Build, test, and deploy containers to Azure Kubernetes Service using GitHub Actions](kubernetes-action).

## Open-source and third-party integrations

There are many open-source and third-party integrations you can install on your AKS cluster. The [AKS support policy](support-policies) doesn't cover self-managed installations of the following projects. Some of these projects have managed experiences built on top of them (for example in the case of Prometheus, Grafana, and Istio). These managed experiences are noted in the 'More Details' column.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

# Reduce image pull time with Artifact Streaming on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

High performance compute workloads often involve large images, which can cause long image pull times and slow down your workload deployments. Artifact Streaming on AKS allows you to stream container images from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to AKS. AKS only pulls the necessary layers for initial pod startup, reducing the time it takes to pull images and deploy your workloads.

Artifact Streaming can reduce time to pod readiness by over 15%, depending on the size of the image, and it works best for images <30GB. Based on our testing, we saw reductions in pod start-up times for images <10GB from minutes to seconds. If you have a pod that needs access to a large file (>30GB), then you should mount it as a volume instead of building it as a layer. This is because if your pod requires that file to start, it congests the node. Artifact Streaming isn't ideal for read heavy images from your filesystem if you need that on startup. With Artifact Streaming, pod start-up becomes concurrent, whereas without it, pods start in serial.

This article describes how to enable the Artifact Streaming feature on your AKS node pools to stream artifacts from ACR.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

Important

Artifact Streaming (preview) is a suggested alternative for customers previously using Teleport (preview).
[Teleport (preview)](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/main/docs/teleport/aks-getting-started.md) on AKS will be retired on 15 July 2025. Please migrate to Artifact Streaming (preview) on AKS or update your node pools to set `--aks-custom-headers EnableACRTeleport=false`

.
Azure Container Registry removed the Teleport API, meaning that any nodes with Teleport enabled will pull images from Azure Container Registry like any other AKS node without Teleport.
After 15 July 2025, AKS node pools with Teleport enabled might experience breakage and node provisioning failures. For more information, see [aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement](https://aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement).

## Limitations

- Artifact Steaming isn't supported for the following OS options:
[Windows Server versions](windows-best-practices),[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks), and[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Prerequisites

- You need an existing AKS cluster with ACR integration. If you don't have one, you can create one using
[Authenticate with ACR from AKS](cluster-container-registry-integration). [Enable Artifact Streaming on ACR](#enable-artifact-streaming-on-acr).- This feature requires Kubernetes version 1.25 or later. To check your AKS cluster version, see
[Check for available AKS cluster upgrades](upgrade-cluster).

Note

Artifact Streaming is only supported on Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 20.04, and Azure Linux node pools. Windows node pools aren't supported.

## Install the `aks-preview`

CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to ensure you have the latest version installed using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Register the `ArtifactStreamingPreview`

feature flag in your subscription

Register the

`ArtifactStreamingPreview`

feature flag in your subscription using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name ArtifactStreamingPreview`


## Enable Artifact Streaming on ACR

Enablement on ACR is a prerequisite for Artifact Streaming on AKS. For more information, see [Artifact Streaming on ACR](https://aka.ms/acr/artifact-streaming).

Create an Azure resource group to hold your ACR instance using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myStreamingTest --location westus`

Create a new premium SKU Azure Container Registry using the

command with the`az acr create`

`--sku Premium`

flag.`az acr create --resource-group myStreamingTest --name mystreamingtest --sku Premium`

Configure the default ACR instance for your subscription using the

command.`az configure`

`az configure --defaults acr="mystreamingtest"`

Push or import an image to the registry using the

command.`az acr import`

`az acr import --source docker.io/jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest --repository jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`

Create a streaming artifact from the image using the

command.`az acr artifact-streaming create`

`az acr artifact-streaming create --image jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`

Verify the generated Artifact Streaming using the

command.`az acr manifest list-referrers`

`az acr manifest list-referrers --name jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`


## Enable Artifact Streaming on AKS

### Enable Artifact Streaming on a new node pool

Create a new node pool with Artifact Streaming enabled using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--enable-artifact-streaming`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myNodePool \ --enable-artifact-streaming`


### Enable Artifact Streaming on an existing node pool

Update an existing node pool to enable Artifact Streaming using the

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--enable-artifact-streaming`

.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myNodePool \ --enable-artifact-streaming`


## Check if Artifact Streaming is enabled

Now that you enabled Artifact Streaming on a premium ACR and connected that to an AKS node pool with Artifact Streaming enabled, any new pod deployments on this cluster with an image pull from the ACR with Artifact Streaming enabled will see reductions in image pull times.

Check if your node pool has Artifact Streaming enabled using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name myNodePool --query artifactStreamingProfile`

In the output, check that the

`Enabled`

field is set to`true`

.
