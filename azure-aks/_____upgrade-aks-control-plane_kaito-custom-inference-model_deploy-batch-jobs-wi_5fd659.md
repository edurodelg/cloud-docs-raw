# Upgrade the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster control plane

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters consist of two main components: the **control plane managed by Azure** and the **node pools where your workloads run**. This article focuses on upgrading the control plane independently, which allows you to adopt new Kubernetes versions for API server features while separately managing node pool upgrades.

## Before you begin

- If you're using the Azure CLI, this article requires Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Use the
`az --version`

command to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this article requires Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Use the
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

cmdlet to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - Performing upgrade operations requires the
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write`

RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the[Azure resource provider operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#containers). - Starting with Kubernetes version 1.30 and 1.27 LTS versions, beta APIs are disabled by default when you upgrade to them.

Warning

Ensure you have sufficient compute quota before upgrading. If quota is low, the upgrade might fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests).

## Overview of AKS upgrade types

The following table outlines three types of AKS upgrades, highlighting their scope and use cases:

| Upgrade type | Scope | Use case |
|---|---|---|
|

[Full cluster](#upgrade-the-full-aks-cluster)[Node pool only](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling)Tip

Upgrading the control plane first allows you to validate Kubernetes API compatibility before affecting running workloads. For node pool upgrade strategies, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

## Kubernetes version upgrade rules

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, you can't skip Kubernetes minor versions. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by minor version number. For example, upgrades between *1.28.x* -> *1.29.x* or *1.29.x* -> *1.30.x* are allowed. *1.28.x* -> *1.30.x* isn't allowed.

The control plane can be up to two minor versions ahead of node pools. For example, if your control plane is at *1.30.x*, your node pools can be at *1.28.x*, *1.29.x*, or *1.30.x*.

## Check for available AKS upgrades

Tip

To stay up to date with the latest AKS releases and updates, see the [AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

Check for available Kubernetes releases for your AKS cluster using the [ az aks get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-upgrades) command.

```
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table
```


The following example output shows the current version as *1.28.9* and lists the available versions under `upgrades`

:

```
Name ResourceGroup MasterVersion Upgrades
------- --------------- --------------- --------------
default <resource-group-name> 1.28.9 1.29.2, 1.29.4
```


## Upgrade the AKS control plane only

Upgrade the control plane using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--control-plane-only`

flag. The following example upgrades the control plane to Kubernetes version*1.29.4*:`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --kubernetes-version 1.29.4 \ --control-plane-only`

Confirm the control plane upgrade was successful using the

command.`az aks show`

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --output table`

The following example output shows the control plane now runs

*1.29.4*:`Name Location ResourceGroup KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------------- ------------------- ------------------------------------------------ <cluster-name> eastus <resource-group-name> 1.29.4 Succeeded <cluster-name>-dns-123abcd4.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io`

Verify the node pool versions remain unchanged using the [

`az aks nodepool list`

][az-aks-nodepool-list] command.`az aks nodepool list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --query "[].{Name:name,Version:orchestratorVersion}" --output table`

In the output, the node pools should still show the previous Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the full AKS cluster

Note

During a full cluster upgrade, AKS upgrades the control plane first, then upgrades each node pool sequentially. For more control over node pool upgrades, see [Configure rolling upgrades](upgrade-aks-node-pools-rolling).

Upgrade the full cluster (control plane and all node pools) using the [ az aks upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-upgrade) command. The following example upgrades the cluster to Kubernetes version

*1.29.4*:

```
az aks upgrade \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <cluster-name> \
--kubernetes-version 1.29.4
```


## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Why were my node pools upgraded when I only upgraded the control plane?

AKS might trigger a rolling node pool upgrade alongside a control plane upgrade to keep the cluster compliant and healthy. This upgrade typically occurs when a previous node upgrade failed or left nodes on mixed versions.

### Can I upgrade node pools before the control plane?

No. The control plane version must always be equal to or greater than any node pool version. You must upgrade the control plane first.

### How long does a control plane upgrade take?

Control plane upgrades typically complete within 5-15 minutes, depending on cluster configuration and Azure region load. Node pool upgrades take longer as they involve draining and reimaging nodes.

## Resolve control plane upgrade issues

### No upgrades available

If `az aks get-upgrades`

shows no available upgrades, your cluster might be:

- Already on the latest supported version.
- On an unsupported version that requires migration.

For unsupported versions, create a new cluster with a supported version and migrate your workloads.

### Upgrade failed due to deprecated APIs

Before upgrading, check for deprecated APIs using tools like [kube-no-trouble (kubent)](https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble):

```
kubent
```


Update your manifests to use supported API versions before upgrading.

# Onboard custom models for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As an AI engineer or developer, you might have to prototype and deploy AI workloads with a range of different model weights. AKS provides the option to deploy inferencing workloads using open-source presets supported out-of-box and managed in the KAITO [model registry](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/presets) or to dynamically download from the [HuggingFace registry](https://huggingface.co/models) at runtime onto your AKS cluster.

In this article, you learn how to onboard a sample HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on without having to manage custom images on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an account, you can

[create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).An AKS cluster with the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled. For more information, see

[Enable KAITO on an AKS cluster](ai-toolchain-operator#enable-the-ai-toolchain-operator-add-on-on-an-aks-cluster).This example deployment requires quota for the

`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

virtual machine (VM) family in your Azure subscription. If you don't have quota for this VM family, please[request a quota increase](/en-us/azure/quotas/quickstart-increase-quota-portal).Note

Currently, only the HuggingFace runtime supports inference with the KAITO custom model deployment template.


## Choose an open-source language model from HuggingFace

In this example, we use the [BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7) small language model. Alternatively, you can choose from thousands of text-generation models supported on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation).

Connect to your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>`

Clone the KAITO project GitHub repository using the

`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito.git`


## Deploy your model inferencing workload using the KAITO workspace template

Navigate to the

`kaito`

directory and copy the[sample deployment YAML](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main/examples/custom-model-integration/custom-model-deployment.yaml)manifest. Replace the default values in the following fields with your model's requirements. For this example, we specify the**bloom-1b7**HuggingFace model ID for[BigScience Bloom-1B7](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-1b7)model:`instanceType`

: The minimum VM size for this inference service deployment is`Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4`

. For larger model sizes you can choose a VM in thefamily with higher memory capacity.`Standard_NCads_A100_v4`

`MODEL_ID`

: Replace with your model's specific HuggingFace identifier, which can be found after`https://huggingface.co/`

in the model card URL.`"--torch_dtype"`

: Set to`"float16"`

for compatibility with V100 GPUs. For A100, H100 or newer GPUs, use`"bfloat16"`

.- (Optional)
`HF_TOKEN`

: Specify the values in this section only if you are deploying a private or gated Hugging Face model for inference.

`apiVersion: kaito.sh/v1beta1 kind: Workspace metadata: name: workspace-custom-llm resource: instanceType: "Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4" # Replace with the required VM SKU based on model requirements labelSelector: matchLabels: apps: custom-llm inference: template: spec: containers: - name: custom-llm-container image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/kaito/kaito-base:0.0.8 # KAITO base image which includes hf runtime livenessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 600 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 readinessProbe: failureThreshold: 3 httpGet: path: /health port: 5000 scheme: HTTP initialDelaySeconds: 30 periodSeconds: 10 successThreshold: 1 timeoutSeconds: 1 resources: requests: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Request 1 GPU; adjust as needed limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Optional: Limit to 1 GPU command: - "accelerate" args: - "launch" - "--num_processes" - "1" - "--num_machines" - "1" - "--gpu_ids" - "all" - "tfs/inference_api.py" - "--pipeline" - "text-generation" - "--trust_remote_code" - "--allow_remote_files" - "--pretrained_model_name_or_path" - "bloom-1b7" - "--torch_dtype" - "bfloat16" # env: # HF_TOKEN is required only for private or gated Hugging Face models # Uncomment and configure this block if needed # - name: HF_TOKEN # valueFrom: # secretKeyRef: # name: hf-token-secret # Replace with your Kubernetes Secret name # key: HF_TOKEN # Replace with the specific key holding the token volumeMounts: - name: dshm mountPath: /dev/shm volumes: - name: dshm emptyDir: medium: Memory`

Save these changes to your

`custom-model-deployment.yaml`

file.Run the deployment in your AKS cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f custom-model-deployment.yaml`


## Test your custom model inferencing service

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace using the

`kubectl get workspace`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace-custom-llm -w`

Note

Note that machine readiness can take

*up to 10 minutes*, and workspace readiness*up to 20 minutes*.Check your language model inference service and get the service IP address using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-custom-llm -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')`

Test your custom model inference service with a sample input of your choice using the

[OpenAI API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat):`kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never curl --image=curlimages/curl -- curl -X POST http://$SERVICE_IP/v1/completions \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "bloom-1b7", "prompt": "What sport should I play in rainy weather?", "max_tokens": 20 }'`


## Clean up resources

If you no longer need these resources, you can delete them to avoid incurring extra Azure compute charges.

Delete the KAITO inference workspace using the `kubectl delete workspace`

command.

```
kubectl delete workspace workspace-custom-llm
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to onboard a HuggingFace model for inferencing with the AI toolchain operator add-on directly to your AKS cluster. To learn more about AI and machine learning on AKS, see the following articles:

# Schedule and deploy batch jobs with Kueue on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to schedule and deploy sample batch jobs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Kueue. Also, this guide covers installing Kueue, configuring ResourceFlavors and ClusterQueues for fine-grained resource management, and submitting jobs via LocalQueues. You also learn how to use Kueue to queue up a sample batch job and track the results across Pending, Running, and Finished states.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

To learn more about Kueue and common uses cases for batch workload administrators and users, see [Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview).

## Prerequisites

- An existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Azure CLI installed on your local machine. To install or upgrade, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Helm version 3 or above](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.[The latest version of Kueue installed in a dedicated namespace on your cluster](kueue-overview#prerequisites).

## Define a ResourceFlavor object

In Kueue, a ResourceFlavors enables fine-grained resource management by associating workloads with specific nodes, taints, tolerations, or availability zones. For nodes, `ResourceFlavors`

can define the characteristics like pricing, availability, brands, models, and architecture (that is, x86 versus ARM CPUs). A `ClusterQueue`

uses these flavors to manage quotas and admission policies for workloads.

This configuration defines a `ResourceFlavor`

without any labels or taints, known as an empty `ResourceFlavor`

. This configuration is perfect when quotas for different flavors don't need to be managed.

Create and save a

`ResourceFlavor`

in a file named`resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat << EOF > resourceflavor-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ResourceFlavor metadata: name: on-demand EOF`

apply

`kubectl apply -f resourceflavor-sample.yaml`

verify

`kubectl get resourceflavors`

Example output

`NAME AGE on-demand 5m32s`


## Create a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that governs a pool of resources, defining usage limits and Fair Sharing rules. Where applicable, Fair Sharing rules allow another ClusterQueue in the **same** cohort to unused quota for pending jobs. Each ClusterQueue specifies which flavors it supports and how much quota is available for each.

This sample `ClusterQueue`

defines:

: Indicates that`namespaceSelector: {}`

`sample-jobs`

accepts workloads from any namespace that references this`ClusterQueue`

via a`LocalQueue`

(you can restrict usage (for example, to only team A's namespace) with a label selector).: Defines the standard CPU and memory resource types managed by this`coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"]`

in`resourceGroups`

`ClusterQueue`

.: Only workloads scheduled on`flavor`

of`on-demand`

nodes with`4`

CPUs,`8Gi`

memory`on-demand`

nodes consume this quota. If the cluster uses up this quota, it doesn't admit any other workloads using this flavor (unless you allow borrowing from the`cohort`

).

Create and save a Kueue

`ClusterQueue`

in a file named`clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following manifest:`cat <<EOF > clusterqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterQueue metadata: name: sample-jobs spec: cohort: general namespaceSelector: {} # Accept workloads from any namespace resourceGroups: - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory"] flavors: - name: on-demand resources: - name: "cpu" nominalQuota: 4 - name: "memory" nominalQuota: 8Gi EOF`

Apply the

`ClusterQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f clusterqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the ClusterQueue` manifest was applied

`kubectl get clusterqueues`

Example output

`NAME COHORT PENDING WORKLOADS sample-jobs general 0`


Note

The `ClusterQueue`

isn't ready for use until a `ResourceFlavor`

object is configured. If you create a `ClusterQueue`

without any existing `ResourceFlavor`

, workloads referencing it are marked as `Inadmissible`

.

## Create a LocalQueue

A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs. A `LocalQueue`

is assigned to one `ClusterQueue`

from which resources are allocated to run its workloads.

This sample `LocalQueue`

configures the following settings:

- Enables users in the
`batch-jobs`

namespace to submit batch workloads to Kueue. - Route the batch workloads to the
`sample-jobs`

`ClusterQueue`

, which manages the actual compute resource quotas and scheduling policies.

Create a namespace named

*batch-jobs*using the`kubectl create`

command.`kubectl create ns batch-jobs`

Create and save a

`LocalQueue`

in a file named`localqueue-sample.yaml`

with the following YAML manifest:`cat <<EOF > localqueue-sample.yaml apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: LocalQueue metadata: name: sample-queue namespace: batch-jobs spec: clusterQueue: sample-jobs EOF`

Apply the

`LocalQueue`

manifest using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f localqueue-sample.yaml`

Verify the

`LocalQueue`

manifest was applied`kubectl get localqueues --all-namespaces`

Exampmle output

`NAMESPACE NAME CLUSTERQUEUE PENDING WORKLOADS ADMITTED WORKLOADS batch-jobs sample-queue sample-jobs 0 0`


## Create 2 batch jobs

This configuration defines two Kubernetes batch jobs submitted to the batch-jobs namespace and assigned to the sample-queue managed by Kueue. Both jobs are single-instance (parallelism: 1, completions: 1) and are configured with `Never`

restart policy. The fields `parallelism`

and `completions`

control how many pods are run and how the job is considered complete. So `parallelism`

and `completions`

of 1 means that one pod can run at once, and the job is marked as complete once one pod finishes successfully, per batch job.

- Job test-batch-1: Requests one CPU and 500Mi memory
- Job test-batch-2: Requests two CPUs and 1Gi memory

Create two sample batch jobs to deploy in the

*batch-jobs*namespace using the following YAML manifest named`batch-workloads.yaml`

:`cat <<EOF > batch-workloads.yaml apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-1 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Running test-batch-1; sleep 60"] resources: requests: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" limits: cpu: "1" memory: "500Mi" restartPolicy: Never --- apiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: test-batch-2 namespace: batch-jobs labels: kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: sample-queue spec: parallelism: 1 completions: 1 template: spec: containers: - name: dummy-job image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.53 command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Waiting in queue for CPUs...; sleep 30"] resources: requests: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" limits: cpu: "2" memory: "1Gi" restartPolicy: Never EOF`

Apply the manifest for the batch jobs using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f batch-workloads.yaml`


## Verify Batch Jobs are Submitted to `LocalQueue`


View the status of the batched workloads using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get workloads --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME ADMITTED AGE test-batch-1 True 10s test-batch-2 False 5s`

Run the following command for

`test-batch-2`

while it is in a`Pending`

state`kubectl get workloads test-batch-2 -o yaml`

Expected output

`... ... Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: False Reason: QuotaUnavailable Message: Insufficient quota in ClusterQueue sample-jobs (flavor on-demand): requested 2 CPUs, available 1 ... ...`

After

`test-batch-1`

completes,`test-batch-2`

will be admitted and run.Now, the output should look like the following example output:

`Status: Conditions: Type: Admitted Status: True Last Transition Time: 1234-56-78T00:00:00Z Admission: ClusterQueue: sample-jobs PodSetAssignments: Name: main Flavors: cpu: on-demand memory: on-demand ResourceUsage: cpu: 2 memory: 1Gi`

View the final status of the

`batch-jobs`

namespace using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get job,deploy,rs,pod,workload --namespace batch-jobs`

Example output

`NAME STATUS COMPLETIONS DURATION AGE job.batch/test-batch-1 Complete 1/1 97s 3m15s job.batch/test-batch-2 Complete 1/1 35s 3m15s NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/test-batch-1-hb8zl 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s pod/test-batch-2-dx9hk 0/1 Completed 0 3m15s NAME QUEUE RESERVED IN ADMITTED FINISHED AGE workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-1-6fb85 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s workload.kueue.x-k8s.io/job-test-batch-2-84f49 sample-queue sample-jobs True True 3m15s`


## FAQ

### Question 1: How can I confirm that the Kueue controller is available and running as expected?

Confirm the Kueue controller manager pod is running using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get pods --namespace kueue-system`

The Kueue controller manager pod should be in a

`Running`

state with`1/1`

containers ready, as shown in the following example output:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE kueue-controller-manager-xxxxxxx 1/1 Running 0 2m`

If the

`Status`

shows`CrashLoopBackOff`

or`Pending`

, check the deployment logs using the`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs --namespace kueue-system deployment/kueue-controller-manager`


### Question 2: One or more of the Kueue custom resources (CRDs) are missing when I install via Helm. How can I ensure all of the CRDs are installed?

After installing Kueue with the

[Kueue overview on AKS](kueue-overview)guidance, confirm that all of the CRDs are installed using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get crds | grep kueue`

These CRDs should be listed, as shown in the following example output:

`admissionchecks.kueue.x-k8s.io clusterqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io cohorts.kueue.x-k8s.io localqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueclusters.kueue.x-k8s.io multikueueconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io provisioningrequestconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io resourceflavors.kueue.x-k8s.io topologies.kueue.x-k8s.io workloadpriorityclasses.kueue.x-k8s.io workloads.kueue.x-k8s.io`

If one or more of the CRDs are missing, you might see errors in controller logs, failed job queuing,

`CrashLoopBackOff`

for the controller, or inability to admit or schedule workloads. In this case, you can manually reinstall the Kueue CRDs using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/latest/download/kueue-crds.yaml`

Note

Note that if you manually install the CRDs, you need to manually delete them once you're finished using the

`kubectl delete`

command.

### Question 3: What's the difference between a LocalQueue and a ClusterQueue

A ClusterQueue is a cluster-scoped resource that defines and governs a pool of compute resources like CPU, memory, pods, and accelerators across the entire Kubernetes cluster. A LocalQueue is a namespace-scoped resource that acts as a gateway for users to submit jobs within the defined Kubernetes cluster. This separation allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation and multi-tenant scheduling without exposing cluster-wide quotas directly to users.

How they work together:

- A user submits a job to a LocalQueue in their namespace.
- Kueue routes the job to the referenced ClusterQueue.
- The ClusterQueue checks resource availability and quota limits.
- If admitted, the job is unsuspended and scheduled.

## Next steps

In this article, you:

- Installed Kueue on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Helm and verified CRDs, controller health, and namespace setup.
- Configured
`ClusterQueue`

and`LocalQueue`

for general-purpose workloads with resource quotas and flavors (such as on-demand). - Submitted two batch jobs to demonstrate queuing: one admitted immediately, the second held due to quota limits, then admitted when resources became available.
- Monitored workload status and controller logs to confirm scheduling behavior and queuing logic.

## Choose a migration path

Select the appropriate migration approach based on your current Azure Identity SDK version:

**Latest Azure Identity SDK**: If your application already uses the latest version of Azure Identity SDK, you can migrate by deploying Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.**Older SDK with migration sidecar**- If your application uses an older SDK version and runs on Linux containers, you can use a temporary migration sidecar to proxy Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions while planning your SDK upgrade.**Older SDK rewrite approach**: If your application uses an older SDK version, you can update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to workload identity.

## Prepare for migration

For all migration paths, you need to have the federated trust set up before you update your application to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID. The following are the minimum steps required:

[Create a managed identity](#create-a-managed-identity)credential.- Associate the user-assigned managed identity with the Kubernetes service account already used for the pod-managed identity or
[create a new Kubernetes service account](#create-kubernetes-service-account)and then associate it with the managed identity. [Establish a federated trust relationship](#establish-federated-identity-credential-trust)between the managed identity and Microsoft Entra ID using the[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc)issuer URL and the service account.

## Migrate from latest version of Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application already uses the latest version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to migrate with minimal code changes.

**Migration approach**: Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with pod-managed identity, verify functionality, then remove pod-managed identity.

**Steps**:

- Deploy Microsoft Entra Workload ID in parallel with existing pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify the application can authenticate successfully using workload identity.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations from your application.- Remove the pod-managed identity add-on from your cluster.

## Use a migration sidecar (Linux containers only)

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK, runs on Linux containers, and you need a temporary solution while planning SDK updates.

**Migration approach**: Deploy a migration sidecar that proxies IMDS transactions to OIDC, allowing your existing application code to work without immediate changes.

**Important limitations**:

**Linux containers only**. Windows containers aren't supported.**Temporary solution**that's not intended for long-term production use.**Planning required**to schedule SDK updates for long-term support.

**Steps**:

[Deploy the workload with migration sidecar](#deploy-the-workload-with-migration-sidecar)to proxy IMDS transactions.- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
- Schedule application SDK updates to supported Azure Identity versions.
- Once SDKs are updated, remove the proxy sidecar and redeploy applications.

## Rewrite application for latest Azure Identity SDK

**This migration path applies when** your application uses an older version of the Azure Identity SDK and you want to update to the latest supported SDK before migrating.

**Migration approach**: Update your application code to use the latest Azure Identity SDK, then migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID with the updated code.

**Technical outcomes**:

- Uses current Azure Identity SDK versions (no deprecation timeline).
- Supports both Linux and Windows containers (unlike sidecar approach).
- Eliminates proxy components and IMDS translation overhead.

**Steps**:

- Update your application code to use the latest
[Azure Identity SDK](workload-identity-overview#prerequisites). - Test the updated application with pod-managed identity.
- Restart your application deployment to begin authenticating using Microsoft Entra Workload ID (OIDC annotations are injected automatically).
- Verify authentication transactions complete successfully.
[Remove the pod-managed identity](#remove-pod-managed-identity)annotations and add-on.

## Set an active Azure subscription

Set a specific Azure subscription as the current active subscription using the

command.`az account set`

`az account set --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Create a managed identity

Create a managed identity using the

command.`az identity create`

`az identity create --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID`


## Get managed identity client ID

Get the client ID of the managed identity and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az identity show`

`export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --query 'clientId' -otsv)"`


## Grant managed identity access to Azure resources

- Grant the managed identity the permissions needed to access the required Azure resources. Follow the steps in
[Assign a managed identity access to a resource](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)to assign the appropriate role to the managed identity.

## Get OIDC issuer URL

Get the OIDC issuer URL and save it to an environmental variable using the

command.`az aks show`

`export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" -o tsv)"`

The variable should contain an issuer URL similar to the following example:

`https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/`

By default, the issuer uses the base URL

`https://{region}.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/{uuid}`

, where the value for`{region}`

matches the location the AKS cluster is deployed in. The value`{uuid}`

represents the OIDC key.

## Get AKS cluster credentials

Get the AKS cluster credentials using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP`


## Create Kubernetes service account

Create a Kubernetes service account and annotate it with the managed identity client ID using the

`kubectl apply`

command. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: ${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID} name: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} namespace: ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE} EOF`

The following output resembles successful creation of the identity:

`Serviceaccount/workload-identity-sa created`


## Establish federated identity credential trust

Create the federated identity credential between the managed identity, service account issuer, and subject using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create --name $FEDERATED_IDENTITY_NAME --identity-name $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --issuer ${AKS_OIDC_ISSUER} --subject system:serviceaccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE}:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME} --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

The federated identity credential takes a few minutes to propagate after being added. If a token request is made immediately after adding the federated identity credential, the token request might fail because the Azure AD directory cache contains outdated information.


## Deploy the workload with migration sidecar

If your application uses user-assigned managed identity and still relies on IMDS to get an access token you can use the migration sidecar to start migrating to Microsoft Entra Workload ID. In long-term applications, you should modify the code to use the latest Azure Identity SDKs that support client assertion.

To update or deploy the workload, add the following [pod annotations](workload-identity-overview#pod-annotations) to your pod specification (only if you want to use the migration sidecar):

| Pod annotation | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar` |
Indicates whether to inject the proxy sidecar into the pod. | `true` or `false` |
`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port` |
Desired port for the proxy sidecar. | Default value: `8000` |

When you create a pod with these annotations, the Microsoft Entra Workload ID mutating webhook automatically injects the `init-container`

and proxy sidecar to the pod spec. The following YAML shows an example of what the mutating webhook adds to the pod deployment:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: httpbin-pod
labels:
app: httpbin
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
annotations:
azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar: "true"
spec:
serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
initContainers:
- name: init-networking
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy-init:v1.1.0
securityContext:
capabilities:
add:
- NET_ADMIN
drop:
- ALL
privileged: true
runAsUser: 0
env:
- name: PROXY_PORT
value: "8000"
containers:
- name: nginx
image: nginx:alpine
ports:
- containerPort: 80
- name: proxy
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/azure/workload-identity/proxy:v1.1.0
ports:
- containerPort: 8000
```


## Verify the workload with migration sidecar

Verify the pod is in a running state using the

command. Replace`kubectl describe pod`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl describe pods <pod-name>`

Verify the pod is passing IMDS transactions using the

command. Replace`kubectl logs`

`<pod-name>`

with the name of your pod.`kubectl logs <pod-name>`

The following example log output resembles successful communication through the proxy sidecar. Verify the logs show a token is successfully acquired and the

`GET`

operation is successful.`I0926 00:29:29.968723 1 proxy.go:97] proxy "msg"="starting the proxy server" "port"=8080 "userAgent"="azure-workload-identity/proxy/v0.13.0-12-gc8527f3 (linux/amd64) c8527f3/2022-09-26-00:19" I0926 00:29:29.972496 1 proxy.go:173] proxy "msg"="received readyz request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/readyz" I0926 00:29:30.936769 1 proxy.go:107] proxy "msg"="received token request" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>" I0926 00:29:31.101998 1 proxy.go:129] proxy "msg"="successfully acquired token" "method"="GET" "uri"="/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?resource=https://management.core.windows.net/api-version=2018-02-01&client_id=<client_id>"`


## Remove pod-managed identity

After you complete your testing and the application can successfully get a token using the proxy sidecar, you can remove the identity and pod-managed identity mapping from your AKS cluster

Remove the pod-managed identity binding from your pod using the

command. Replace`az aks pod-identity delete`

`<pod-identity-name>`

and`<pod-identity-namespace>`

with the name and namespace of your pod identity.`az aks pod-identity delete --name <pod-identity-name> --namespace <pod-identity-namespace> --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

# Resize Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to resize an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It's important to right-size your clusters to optimize costs and performance. You can manually resize a cluster by adding or removing the nodes to meet the needs of your applications. You can also autoscale your cluster to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

## Cluster right-sizing

When you create an AKS cluster, you specify the number of nodes and the size of the nodes, which determines the compute capacity of the cluster. Oversized clusters can lead to unnecessary costs, while undersized clusters can lead to performance issues. You can adjust the number and size of the nodes in the cluster to right-size the cluster to meet the needs of your applications.

Consider the following factors when right-sizing your cluster:

**Resource requirements**: Understand the resource requirements of your applications to determine the number of nodes and the size of the nodes needed to run your workloads.**Performance requirements**: Determine the performance requirements of your applications to ensure that the cluster can meet the demands of your workloads.**Cost considerations**: Optimize costs by right-sizing your cluster to avoid unnecessary costs associated with oversized clusters.**Application demands**: Monitor the demands of your applications to adjust the size of the cluster in response to changing demands.**Infrastructure constraints**: Consider the infrastructure constraints of your environment, such as capacity or reserved instance limiting to specific SKUs, to ensure that the cluster can be right-sized within the limits of your environment.

## Monitor cluster performance and cost

Closely monitor the performance and cost of your clusters to ensure they're right-sized to meet the needs of your application and make adjustments as needed. You can use the following resources for monitoring:

[Identify high CPU usage in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-high-cpu-consuming-containers-aks)[Troubleshoot memory saturation in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/identify-memory-saturation-aks)[Cost analysis add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cost-analysis)[Configure the Metrics Server Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)

## When to resize a cluster

You might want to resize a cluster in scenarios such as the following:

- If you see that CPU and memory usage is consistently low, consider
*downsizing*the cluster. If usage is consistently high, make sure you have[autoscaling enabled](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster)and increase the maximum node count if necessary. - The
[cost analysis add-on for AKS](cost-analysis)shows you details about node usage and cost that indicate you might benefit from cluster resizing. For example, if you see that your nodes have a*high idle cost*with a*low usage cost*, you might consider resizing your cluster to reduce costs. - The
[Metrics Server VPA](use-metrics-server-vertical-pod-autoscaler)shows you that your requests and/or limits are too high or low based on historical usage. You can use this information to adjust your cluster size to better match your workload. - You experience performance issues such as resource starvation. This might be a result of the cluster being undersized for the demands of your applications.

## What happens when I resize a cluster?

### Increasing cluster size

You can increase the size of an AKS cluster by adding nodes to the cluster. You can [add nodes to the cluster manually](scale-cluster) or [configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes](#automatically-resize-an-aks-cluster) in response to changing demands.

When you increase the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- New node instances are created using the same configuration as the existing nodes in the cluster.
- New pods might be scheduled on the new nodes to distribute the workload across the cluster.
- Existing pods don't move to the new nodes unless they are rescheduled due to node failures or other reasons.

### Decreasing cluster size

You can decrease the size of an AKS cluster by removing nodes from the cluster. When you remove nodes from the cluster, the nodes are automatically drained and removed from the cluster. You can remove nodes from the cluster manually or configure autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of nodes in response to changing demands.

When you decrease the size of a cluster, the following changes occur:

- AKS gracefully terminates the nodes and drains the pods running on the nodes before removing the nodes from the cluster.
- Any pods managed by a replication controller are rescheduled on other node instances in the cluster.
- Any pods that aren't managed by a replication controller aren't restarted.

## Manually resize an AKS cluster

- Resize an AKS cluster using the
command with the`az aks scale`

`--node-count`

and`--nodepool-name`

parameters.

Before running the resize command, set the required environment variables with your own values. The example values should be substituted with your actual resource group, cluster, desired node count, and node pool name.

```
az aks scale --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count $NUM_NODES --nodepool-name $NODE_POOL_NAME
```


Results:

```
{
"agentPoolProfiles": [
{
"count": 4,
"maxCount": null,
"minCount": null,
"name": "nodepool1",
...
}
],
"dnsPrefix": "xxxxx",
"fqdn": "xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx.cloudapp.azure.com",
...
}
```


Repeat this command for each node pool in the cluster that you want to resize. If your cluster has only one node pool, you can omit the `--nodepool-name`

parameter.

## Automatically resize an AKS cluster

Use the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview) to automatically resize your node pools in response to changing demands.

For more information, see the [Cluster autoscaling in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview](cluster-autoscaler-overview). To configure cluster autoscaling in AKS, see [Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](cluster-autoscaler).

## Versioning and support policy

### Service mesh add-on release calendar

The Istio-based service mesh add-on release calendar indicates each revision's AKS compatibility and estimated release and deprecation dates.

New minor revisions and patches are rolled out as part of AKS releases. Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To see real-time updates of regional release status and AKS release notes containing updates about Istio revision support, visit the [AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

| Service mesh revision | Upstream release | AKS release | End of life | Compatible AKS versions | Compatible AKS LTS versions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| asm-1-17 | Feb 2023 | Apr 2023 | Jan 2024 | 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 | |

If using an AKS [long term-support (LTS) cluster](long-term-support), a newer revision may be declared as compatible when a previous compatible Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version's end of life. For more details, read Istio's [AKS compatibility policy](#aks-compatibility).

### Supported revisions

**Minor revision**:- At any given time, at least two revisions of the Istio-based service mesh add-on are supported.
- An older revision
`n-2`

will continue to be supported until six weeks after the newest revision`n`

starts rolling out to all regions. For example, if`asm-1-22`

just started rolling out to all regions,`asm-1-20`

will be deprecated after six weeks. - Deprecation means no new mesh installations can be done with this revision. While clusters already having this revision continue to work, for support issues and security patches, it's recommended to
[upgrade to a newer supported mesh revision](istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade).

**Patch version**:- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then
[upgrade istio-proxy sidecars by restarting their workloads](istio-upgrade#patch-version-upgrade). - AKS reserves the right to deprecate patches if a critical Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) or security vulnerability is detected. For awareness on patch availability and any ad-hoc deprecation, refer to
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases)and visit the[AKS release status webpage](https://releases.aks.azure.com/).

- Patches to Istio control plane (istiod) and Istio ingresses are rolled out as part of AKS releases. User is expected to follow AKS release notes on availability of newer patch versions and to then

### Default revision

If a revision isn't explicitly provided by user during installation, the `n-1`

revision is installed by default. For example, if `asm-1-22`

is the latest revision, the default is `asm-1-21`

.

### AKS compatibility

Each revision of the add-on is compatible with a set of AKS minor versions established by the [upstream Istio support and release calendar](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases/#support-status-of-istio-releases).

**AKS LTS clusters may be compatible with additional revisions beyond upstream Istio's support table.** For Istio revisions `asm-1-25`

+ and AKS LTS versions 1.28+, every supported AKS LTS version will have *at least one* compatible Istio revision.

To check the compatible AKS versions for an Istio revision, use the command [ az aks mesh get-revisions](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions):

```
az aks mesh get-revisions --location <location> -o table
```


This command has been updated to include separate `CompatibleWith`

outputs for `KubernetesOfficial`

(standard tier) and `AKSLongTermSupport`

, replacing the earlier response that only included `kubernetes`

(standard tier).

If using the Azure portal to enable the Istio add-on for an existing cluster, the available Istio revisions will be filtered based on the cluster's tier.

Each Istio add-on revision follows upstream lifecycle for end of life and patch availability. This means:

Every Istio revision will not be compatible with every AKS LTS version, but every AKS LTS version will be compatible with at least one Istio add-on revision.

If an Istio revision reaches end of life before the AKS LTS version it is compatible with, a newer revision will be declared compatible with that LTS version. The add-on will need to be upgraded to stay in support.

For example, if

`asm-1-26`

is compatible with AKS LTS 1.28, and`asm-1-26`

reaches end of life,`asm-1-27`

may become compatible with 1.28 LTS instead.

## Allowed, supported, and blocked customizations

The Istio-based service mesh add-on for AKS designates features and [configuration options](istio-meshconfig#allowed-supported-and-blocked-meshconfig-values) as `allowed`

, `supported`

, or `blocked`

.

**Blocked**: Disallowed features and configuration options are blocked via add-on managed admission webhooks. The API server immediately publishes the error message to the user that the feature is disallowed.**Supported**: Supported features receive support from Azure support.**Allowed**: Allowed features are open and available to Istio add-on users but aren't covered by Azure support.

# Use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to use node taints in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

The AKS scheduling mechanism is responsible for placing pods onto nodes and is based upon the upstream Kubernetes scheduler, [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/). You can constrain a pod to run on particular nodes by attaching the pods to a set of nodes using [node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or by instructing the node to repel a set of pods using [node taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/), which interact with the AKS scheduler.

Node taints work by marking a node so that the scheduler avoids placing certain pods on the marked nodes. You can place [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) on a pod to allow the scheduler to schedule that pod on a node with a matching taint. Taints and tolerations work together to help you control how the scheduler places pods onto nodes. For more information, see [example use cases of taints and tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases:%7E:text=not%20be%20evicted.-,Example%20Use%20Cases,-Taints%20and%20tolerations).

Taints are key-value pairs with an [effect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/). There are three values for the effect field when using node taints: `NoExecute`

, `NoSchedule`

, and `PreferNoSchedule`

.

`NoExecute`

: Pods already running on the node are immediately evicted if they don't have a matching toleration. If a pod has a matching toleration, it might be evicted if`tolerationSeconds`

are specified.`NoSchedule`

: Only pods with a matching toleration are placed on this node. Existing pods aren't evicted.`PreferNoSchedule`

: The scheduler avoids placing any pods that don't have a matching toleration.

### Node taint options

There are two types of node taints that can be applied to your AKS nodes: **node taints** and **node initialization taints**.

**Node taints**are meant to remain permanently on the node for scheduling pods with node affinity. Node taints can only be added, updated, or removed completely using the AKS API.**Node initialization taints**are placed on the node at boot time and are meant to be used temporarily, such as in scenarios where you might need extra time to set up your nodes. You can remove node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API and they aren't guaranteed during the node lifecycle. They will appear on new replicas of the node when it is scaled up or on all replicas when a node is upgraded. If you want to remove the initialization taints completely, you can remove them using the AKS API after untainting the nodes using the Kubernetes API. Once you remove the initialization taints from the cluster spec using the AKS API, newly created nodes don't come up with those initialization taints. If the initialization taint is still present on existing nodes, you can permanently remove it by performing a node image upgrade operation.

Note

Node taints and labels applied using the AKS node pool API aren't modifiable from the Kubernetes API and vice versa. Modifications to system taints aren't allowed.

This doesn't apply to node initialization taints.

## Use node taints

### Prerequisites

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### Create a node pool with a node taint

Create a node pool with a taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool add`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


### Update a node pool to add a node taint

Update a node pool to add a node taint using the

command and use the`az aks nodepool update`

`--node-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --no-wait`


## Use node initialization taints (preview)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

### Prerequisites and limitations

- You need the Azure CLI version
`3.0.0b3`

or later installed and configured. Run`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can only apply initialization taints via cluster create or upgrade when using the AKS API. If using ARM template that will result in a Managed Cluster level operation, you can specify node initialization taints during node pool creation and update. Agentpool level operations are blocked when
`NodeInitializationTaints`

are present in the request body. - You can't apply initialization taints to Windows node pools using the Azure CLI.

### Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Register or update the aks-preview extension using the

or`az extension add`

command.`az extension update`

`# Register the aks-preview extension az extension add --name aks-preview # Update the aks-preview extension az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`NodeInitializationTaintsPreview`

feature flag using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

*Registered*.Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "NodeInitializationTaintsPreview"`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a cluster with a node initialization taint

Create a cluster with a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks create`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

The node initialization taints you specify apply to all of the node pools in the cluster. To apply the initialization taint to a specific node, you can use an ARM template instead of the CLI.

`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-count 1 \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint

Update a cluster to add a node initialization taint using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--node-initialization-taints`

parameter to specify`sku=gpu:NoSchedule`

for the taint.Important

When updating a cluster with a node initialization taint, the taints apply to all node pools in the cluster. If your nodes are using VMSS, you can view updates to node initialization taints on the node after the node's VMSS model is updated (for example, after a node image version upgrade operation). Initialization taints will not appear on your nodes until an operation that triggers a VMSS model update occurs.

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints "sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`


## Check the status of the node pool

After applying the node taint or initialization taint, check the status of the node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`

If you applied node initialization taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool is`Creating`

nodes with the specified`nodeInitializationTaints`

:`[ { ... "count": 1, ... "name": "<node-pool-name>", "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.7", ... "provisioningState": "Creating", ... "nodeInitializationTaints": [ "sku=gpu:NoSchedule" ], ... }, ... ]`


## Check that the taint is set on the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you applied node taints, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool has the specified`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: sku=gpu:NoSchedule ... ], ... ... ]`


Important

If your nodes are using VMSS, node initialization taints will not be visible on actual nodes in your cluster until an operation that triggers VMSS model update occurs (for example, Kubernetes version upgrade or node image version upgrade).

## Remove node taints

### Remove a specific node taint

Remove node taints using the

command. The following example command removes the`az aks nodepool update`

`"sku=gpu:NoSchedule"`

node taint from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


### Remove all node taints

Remove all node taints from a node pool using the

command. The following example command removes all node taints from the node pool.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-taints ""`


## Remove node initialization taints

You have the following options to remove node initialization taints from the node:

**Remove node initialization taints temporarily**using the Kubernetes API. If you remove them this way, the taints reappear after node scaling or upgrade occurs. New nodes still have the node initialization taint after scaling. Node initialization taints appear on all nodes after upgrading.**Remove node initialization taints permanently**by untainting the node using the Kubernetes API, and then removing the taint using the AKS API. Once the initialization taints are removed from cluster spec using AKS API, newly created nodes after reimage operations no longer have initialization taints.

When you remove all initialization taint occurrences from node pool replicas, the existing initialization taint might reappear after an upgrade with any new initialization taints.

### Remove node initialization taints temporarily

Remove node initialization taints temporarily using the

`kubectl taint nodes`

command.This command removes the taint from only the specified node. If you want to remove the taint from every node in the node pool, you need to run the command for every node that you want the taint removed from.

`kubectl taint nodes $NODE_POOL_NAME sku=gpu:NoSchedule-`

Once removed, node initialization taints reappear after node scaling or upgrading occurs.


### Remove node initialization taints permanently

Follow steps in

[Remove node initialization taints temporarily](#remove-node-initialization-taints-temporarily)to remove the node initialization taint using the Kubernetes API.Remove the taint from the node using the AKS API using the

command. This command removes the node initialization taint from every node in the cluster.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --node-init-taints ""`


## Check that the taint has been removed from the node

Check the node taints and node initialization taints in the node configuration using the

`kubectl describe node`

command.`kubectl describe node $NODE_NAME`

If you removed a node taint, the following example output shows that the

`<node-pool-name>`

node pool doesn't have the removed taint under`Taints`

:`[ ... Name: <node-pool-name> ... Taints: ... ], ... ... ]`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes the node images available for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes.

Important

Starting on **March 17, 2027**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Ubuntu 20.04. Any existing node images will be deleted, and you'll be unable to scale any node pools running Ubuntu 20.04. Migrate to a supported Ubuntu version by [upgrading your node pools](upgrade-aks-cluster) to Kubernetes version 1.35+. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4874) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=485795). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning on **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500645). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on March 01, 2026, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2019 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.33+ can't use Windows Server 2019. Starting on April 01, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=aks-will-stop-support-for-windows-server-2019-on-march-1-2026). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Starting on March 15, 2027, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports Windows Server 2022 node pools. Node pools running Kubernetes version 1.36+ can't use Windows Server 2022. Starting on April 01, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail. For more information on this retirement, see the [Retirement GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168) and the [Azure Updates retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=ws2022-retirement-aks). To stay informed on announcements and updates, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).

Important

Older node images can contain unpatched security vulnerabilities and might not work properly with recently released features. Using older images might lead to issues with scaling, node readiness, and security. Depending on the age of the image version, it could also place the cluster outside of the support scope until you perform a node image upgrade. **We recommend that you keep node images current and enable automatic upgrades**.

## Node image releases

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) regularly provides new node images, so it's beneficial to upgrade your node images frequently to access the latest AKS features, component updates, and security fixes. You can find detailed summaries of each node image version in the [AKS VHD notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/tree/master/vhd-notes).

Linux node images are released weekly, and Windows node images are released monthly. New node images are included in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).


Best practice guidanceConfigure

[automatic node image upgrades]and schedule them using[planned maintenance]. This will ensure that your node images are always up to date without requiring manual upgrades.

When new node images are released, it can take up to two weeks for the updates to be rolled out across all regions. The [AKS Release Tracker](release-tracker) shows the current latest node image version, three previously available node image versions for each region, and the node image update order by region. Once the node image is available in your region, you can perform a [manual node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) or configure [automatic node image upgrades](auto-upgrade-node-os-image) and schedule them using [planned maintenance](planned-maintenance).

## Default node images

AKS sets a default operating system (OS) and node image during cluster and node pool creation. OS Type can be used to filter between Linux or Windows.

| OS Type | Default OS | Default node image |
|---|---|---|
| Not Specified | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2 |
| Linux | Ubuntu Linux | Ubuntu with containerd and gen 2 |
| Windows | Windows Server | Windows Server Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) with containerd and gen 1 |

Note

You can't specify the Windows OS Type during cluster creation since the system node pool in every cluster must be Linux.

### Factors that influence the default node image

The following factors influence the default image AKS chooses for your node pool:

**OS SKU**: If`--os-sku`

is specified, then your default OS changes. For example, if you specify Azure Linux as the OS SKU, then your node image is Azure Linux with containerd.**Virtual machine (VM) size**:**Hypervisor generation**: Each VM size supports Generation 1,[Generation 2](generation-2-vm), or both.- If Generation 2 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 2 node image in all OS versions except for Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022.
- If only Generation 1 is supported, AKS defaults to using the Generation 1 node image. Generation 1 isn't supported for Azure Linux OS Guard (preview) or Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview).

**Feature enablement**: There are some features embedded into the node image. If you choose to use any of these features, your default node image changes.[Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)](enable-fips-nodes)changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.[Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing)changes the default node image for Azure Linux node pools.[Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch)changes the default node image for all Linux node pools.


Note

Certain features can't be combined in a single node pool. Follow links to the feature documentation to review the limitations.

# Deploy an application that uses OpenAI on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy an application that uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI on AKS. With OpenAI, you can easily adapt different AI models, such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code generation, for your specific tasks. You start by deploying an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Then, you deploy your OpenAI service and the sample application.

The sample cloud native application is representative of real-world implementations. The multi-container application is comprised of applications written in multiple languages and frameworks, including:

- Golang with Gin
- Rust with Actix-Web
- JavaScript with Vue.js and Fastify
- Python with FastAPI

These applications provide front ends for customers and store admins, REST APIs for sending data to RabbitMQ message queue and MongoDB database, and console apps to simulate traffic.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

To access the GitHub codebase for the sample application, see [AKS Store Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - For this demo, you can either use Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI service.
- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the
[Request access to Azure OpenAI Service form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). - If you plan on using OpenAI, sign up on the
[OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is a logical group in which you deploy and manage Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

The following example output shows successful creation of the resource group:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup", "location": "eastus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroup", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup*.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`

Note

If your Linux-based system requires elevated permissions, you can use the

`sudo az aks install-cli`

command.Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

This command executes the following operations:

- Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
- Uses
`~/.kube/config`

, the default location for the[Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using*--file*argument.

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is

*Ready*.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6`


Note

For private clusters, the nodes might be unreachable if you try to connect to them through the public IP address. In order to fix this, you need to create an endpoint within the same VNET as the cluster to connect from. Follow the instructions to [Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters) and then connect to it.

## Deploy the application

The [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Makeline service**: Processes orders from the queue and completes the orders.**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Store admin**: Web application for store employees to view orders in the queue and manage product information.**Virtual customer**: Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis.**Virtual worker**: Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis.**Mongo DB**: NoSQL instance for persisted data.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

Review the

[YAML manifest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml)for the application.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/mongodb created service/mongodb created deployment.apps/rabbitmq created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/makeline-service created service/makeline-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created deployment.apps/store-admin created service/store-admin created deployment.apps/virtual-customer created deployment.apps/virtual-worker created`


## Deploy OpenAI

You can either use Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and run your application on AKS.

- In the Azure portal, create an Azure OpenAI instance.
- Navigate to the Azure OpenAI instance you created.
- From the
**Overview**blade, navigate to the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). - Create a new
**Chat**deployment using the**gpt-4o-mini**base model.

For more information on how to create a deployment in Azure OpenAI, see [Get started generating text using Azure OpenAI Service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Deploy the AI service

Now that the application is deployed, you can deploy the Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to automatically generate descriptions for new products being added to the store's catalog.

Create a file named

`ai-service.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "" - name: OPENAI_API_KEY value: "" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ai-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 5001 targetPort: 5001 selector: app: ai-service`

Set the environment variable

`USE_AZURE_OPENAI`

to`"True"`

.Get your Azure OpenAI deployment name from

[Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/portal/)and fill in the`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

value.Get your Azure OpenAI endpoint and Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure portal by selecting

**Keys and Endpoint**in the left blade of the resource. Update the`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

and`OPENAI_API_KEY`

in the YAML accordingly.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ai-service.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/ai-service created service/ai-service created`


Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use [Managed Identity](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity#authorize-access-to-managed-identities) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI service instead or store your secrets in [Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).

## Test the application

Check the status of the deployed pods using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods`

Make sure all the pods are

*Running*before continuing to the next step.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE makeline-service-7db94dc7d4-8g28l 1/1 Running 0 99s mongodb-78f6d95f8-nptbz 1/1 Running 0 99s order-service-55cbd784bb-6bmfb 1/1 Running 0 99s product-service-6bf4d65f74-7cbvk 1/1 Running 0 99s rabbitmq-9855984f9-94nlm 1/1 Running 0 99s store-admin-7f7d768c48-9hn8l 1/1 Running 0 99s store-front-6786c64d97-xq5s9 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-customer-79498f8667-xzsb7 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-worker-6d77fff4b5-7g7rj 1/1 Running 0 99s`

Get the IP of the store admin web application and store front web application using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-admin`

The application exposes the Store Admin site to the internet via a public load balancer provisioned by the Kubernetes service. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

**EXTERNAL IP**initially shows*pending*until the service comes up and shows the IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE store-admin LoadBalancer 10.0.142.228 40.64.86.161 80:32494/TCP 50m`

Repeat the same step for the service named `store-front``.

Open a web browser and browse to the external IP address of your service. In the example shown here, open

*40.64.86.161*to see Store Admin in the browser. Repeat the same step for Store Front.In store admin, select the products tab, then select

**Add Products**.When the `ai-service`` is running successfully, you should see the Ask OpenAI button next to the description field. Fill in the name, price, and keywords, then generate a product description by selecting

**Ask OpenAI**>**Save product**.You can now see the new product you created on Store Admin used by sellers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added.

You can also see the new product you created on Store Front used by buyers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added. Remember to get the IP address of store front using the

command.`kubectl get service`

# Best practices for application developers to manage resources in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you develop and run applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are a few key areas to consider. The way you manage your application deployments can negatively impact the end-user experience of services you provide.

This article focuses on running your clusters and workloads from an application developer perspective. For information about administrative best practices, see [Cluster operator best practices for isolation and resource management in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

This article covers the following topics:

- Pod resource requests and limits.
- Ways to develop, debug, and deploy applications with Bridge to Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code.

## Define pod resource requests and limits


Best practice guidanceSet pod requests and limits on all pods in your YAML manifests. If the AKS cluster uses

resource quotasand you don't define these values, your deployment may be rejected.

Use pod requests and limits to manage compute resources within an AKS cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler of the compute resources to assign to a pod.

### Pod CPU/Memory requests

*Pod requests* define a set amount of CPU and memory the pod needs regularly.

In your pod specifications, it's important you define these requests and limits based on the above information. If you don't include these values, the Kubernetes scheduler can't consider the resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

Monitor the performance of your application to adjust pod requests. If you underestimate pod requests, your application may receive degraded performance due to over-scheduling a node. If requests are overestimated, your application may have increased scheduling difficulty.

### Pod CPU/Memory limits

*Pod limits* set the maximum amount of CPU and memory a pod can use. *Memory limits* define which pods should be removed when nodes are unstable due to insufficient resources. Without proper limits set, pods are removed until resource pressure is lifted. While a pod may exceed the *CPU limit* periodically, the pod isn't removed for exceeding the CPU limit.

Pod limits define when a pod loses control of resource consumption. When it exceeds the limit, the pod is marked for removal. This behavior maintains node health and minimizes impact to pods sharing the node. If you don't set a pod limit, it defaults to the highest available value on a given node.

Avoid setting a pod limit higher than your nodes can support. Each AKS node reserves a set amount of CPU and memory for the core Kubernetes components. Your application may try to consume too many resources on the node for other pods to successfully run.

Monitor the performance of your application at different times during the day or week. Determine peak demand times and align the pod limits to the resources required to meet maximum needs.

Important

In your pod specifications, define these requests and limits based on the above information. Failing to include these values prevents the Kubernetes scheduler from accounting for resources your applications require to help with scheduling decisions.

If the scheduler places a pod on a node with insufficient resources, application performance is degraded. Cluster administrators **must set resource quotas** on a namespace that requires you to set resource requests and limits. For more information, see

[resource quotas on AKS clusters](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas).

When you define a CPU request or limit, the value is measured in CPU units.

*1.0*CPU equates to one underlying virtual CPU core on the node.- The same measurement is used for GPUs.

- You can define fractions measured in millicores. For example,
*100 m*is*0.1*of an underlying vCPU core.

In the following basic example for a single NGINX pod, the pod requests *100 m* of CPU time and *128Mi* of memory. The resource limits for the pod are set to *250 m* CPU and *256Mi* memory.

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
- name: mypod
image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine
resources:
requests:
cpu: 100m
memory: 128Mi
limits:
cpu: 250m
memory: 256Mi
```


For more information about resource measurements and assignments, see [Managing compute resources for containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/).

## Develop and debug applications against an AKS cluster


Best practice guidanceDevelopment teams should deploy and debug against an AKS cluster using Bridge to Kubernetes.


With Bridge to Kubernetes, you can develop, debug, and test applications directly against an AKS cluster. Developers within a team collaborate to build and test throughout the application lifecycle. You can continue to use existing tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the Bridge to Kubernetes extension.

Using integrated development and test process with Bridge to Kubernetes reduces the need for local test environments like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/). Instead, you develop and test against an AKS cluster, even in secured and isolated clusters.

Note

Bridge to Kubernetes is intended for use with applications running on Linux pods and nodes.

## Use the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension for Kubernetes


Best practice guidanceInstall and use the VS Code extension for Kubernetes when you write YAML manifests. You can also use the extension for integrated deployment solution, which may help application owners that infrequently interact with the AKS cluster.


The [Visual Studio Code extension for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools) helps you develop and deploy applications to AKS. The extension provides the following features:

Intellisense for Kubernetes resources, Helm charts, and templates.

The ability to browse, deploy, and edit capabilities for Kubernetes resources from within VS Code.

Intellisense checks for resource requests or limits being set in the pod specifications:

# Build and deploy data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Flyte on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Flyte is an open-source workflow orchestrator that unifies machine learning, data engineering, and data analytics stacks to help you build robust and reliable applications. When using Flyte as a Kubernetes-native workflow automation tool, you can focus on experimentation and providing business value without increasing your scope to infrastructure and resource management. Keep in mind that Flyte isn't officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own discretion.

For more information, see [Introduction to Flyte](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/).

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Flyte use cases

Flyte can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Deliver models for streamlined profit and loss financial calculations.
- Process petabytes of data to efficiently conduct 3D mapping of new areas.
- Quickly rollback to previous versions and minimize impact of bugs in your pipelines.

For more information, see [Flyte tutorials](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/tutorials/).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`

command.

- If you have multiple subscriptions, make sure you select the correct one using the
- The Azure CLI installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The Helm CLI installed and updated. Check your version using the
`helm version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). - The
`kubectl`

command or using[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - A local Docker development environment. For more information, see
[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). `flytekit`

and`flytectl`

installed. For more information, see[Flyte installation](https://www.union.ai/docs/flyte/user-guide/getting-started/local-setup/).

Note

If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, the Azure CLI, Helm, and kubectl are already installed.

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for use throughout the article. Replace the placeholder values with your own values.

`export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-name>" export LOCATION="<location>" export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>" export DNS_NAME_PREFIX="<dns-name-prefix>"`


## Create an AKS cluster

Create an Azure resource group for the AKS cluster using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

,`--enable-managed-identity`

,`--enable-aad`

, and`--dns-name-prefix`

parameters.`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac --enable-managed-identity --enable-aad --dns-name-prefix $DNS_NAME_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys`


## Connect to your AKS cluster

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Add the Flyte Helm repository

Add the Flyte Helm repository using the

`helm repo add`

command.`helm repo add flyteorg https://flyteorg.github.io/flyte`


## Find Flyte Helm charts

Search for Flyte Helm charts using the

`helm search repo`

command.`helm search repo flyteorg`

The following example output shows some of the available Flyte Helm charts:

`NAME CHART VERSION APP VERSION DESCRIPTION flyteorg/flyte v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte Sandbox flyteorg/flyte-binary v1.12.0 1.16.0 Chart for basic single Flyte executable deployment flyteorg/flyte-core v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte core flyteorg/flyte-deps v1.12.0 A Helm chart for Flyte dependencies flyteorg/flyte-sandbox 0.1.0 1.16.1 A Helm chart for the Flyte local sandbox flyteorg/flyteagent v0.1.10 A Helm chart for Flyte Agent`

Update the repository using the

`helm repo update`

command.`helm repo update`


## Deploy a Flyte chart on AKS

In this section, you deploy the flyte-binary Helm chart so you can begin building and deploying data and machine learning pipelines with Flyte on AKS. The flyte-binary chart is a basic single Flyte executable deployment.

Create a namespace for your Flyte deployment using the

`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>`

Install a Flyte Helm chart using the

`helm install`

command. In this example, we use the`flyte-binary`

chart.`helm install flyte-binary flyteorg/flyte-core --namespace <namespace-name>`

Verify that the Flyte deployment is running using the

`kubectl get services`

command.`kubectl get services --namespace <namespace-name> --output wide`

The following condensed example output shows the Flyte deployment:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE flyteorg-flyte-binary-grpc ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 81/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-http ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m flyteorg-flyte-binary-webhook ClusterIP xx.x.xx.xxx <none> 80/TCP 1m`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to install Flyte on AKS using a Helm chart.
The Flyte project also maintains a [reference implementation for AKS](https://github.com/unionai-oss/deploy-flyte/tree/main/environments/azure/flyte-core#readme) that automatically configures all the dependencies and deploys a production grade Flyte cluster.

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS monitoring requires multiple levels of observability across platform metrics, Prometheus metrics, activity logs, resource logs, and container insights. AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

These log files track information like when a cluster is created or changes are made to a cluster configuration. To analyze activity log data with your other log data,[send activity log data to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log#send-to-log-analytics-workspace).[Create a diagnostic setting](#aks-control-plane-resource-logs)to[send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). In the workspace, you can analyze the logs using queries and set up alerts based on log information.[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)and in[Azure Monitor metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|
| Count logs for each category | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS"` | `summarize count() by Category` |
| All API server logs | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| All kube-audit logs in a time range | Azure diagnostics mode | `let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23");` `let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24");` `AzureDiagnostics` | `where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)` | `where Category == "kube-audit"` | `extend event = parse_json(log_s)` | `extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)` | `extend User = tostring(event.user.username)` | `extend Apiserver = pod_s` | `extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])` | `project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event` |
| All audit logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSAudit` |
All audit logs excluding the `get` and `list` audit events |
Resource-specific mode | `AKSAuditAdmin` |
| All API server logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSControlPlane` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |

To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries#queries-interface), and select the **Kubernetes Services** resource type. For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

The complete audit policy used in AKS is available for review in the following collapsible section.

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved. For more information, see[Azure Monitor REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/filter-syntax).**Logs:**Use the REST API or the[associated client libraries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).Another option is the

[workspace data export](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal).

To get started with the REST API for Azure Monitor, see

[Azure monitoring REST API walkthrough](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough?tabs=portal).

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

## AKS node network metrics monitoring


Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).

# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS monitoring requires multiple levels of observability across platform metrics, Prometheus metrics, activity logs, resource logs, and container insights. AKS provides built-in monitoring capabilities and integrates with Azure Monitor, Container insights, managed service for Prometheus, and Azure Managed Grafana for comprehensive cluster health and performance monitoring.

Tip

You can use Azure Copilot to configure monitoring on your AKS clusters in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#configure-monitoring-on-clusters).

## Insights

Some services in Azure have a built-in monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These dashboards are called *insights*, and you can find them in the **Insights Hub** of Azure Monitor in the Azure portal.

## AKS monitoring data: metrics, logs, integrations

AKS generates the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources as described in [Monitor data from Azure resources](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). For detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

[Other Azure services and features](#integrations) collect other data and enable other analysis options as shown in the following diagram and table.

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| Platform metrics |
|

Analyze these metrics using[prebuilt dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin#use-out-of-the-box-dashboards)in[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)and with[Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/prometheus-alerts).[activity log](monitor-aks-reference)automatically collects some data for AKS clusters at no cost. These log files track information like when a cluster is created or changes are made to a cluster configuration. To analyze activity log data with your other log data,[send activity log data to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log#send-to-log-analytics-workspace).[Create a diagnostic setting](#aks-control-plane-resource-logs)to[send the logs to a Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). In the workspace, you can analyze the logs using queries and set up alerts based on log information.[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)and in[Azure Monitor metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics). Analyze data like`stdout`

and `stderr`

streams using views and workbooks in Container insights or [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)and the[metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).[Application Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), a feature of Azure Monitor, collects logs, metrics, and distributed traces. The telemetry is stored in a[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)for analysis in the Azure portal. To enable Application Insights with code changes, see[Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview). To enable Application Insights without code changes, see[AKS autoinstrumentation](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/kubernetes-codeless). For more information on instrumentation, learn about[data collection basics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-overview).## Resource types

Azure uses the concept of resource types and IDs to identify everything in a subscription. Resource types are also part of the resource IDs for every resource running in Azure. For example, one resource type for a virtual machine is `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`

. For a list of services and their associated resource types, see [Resource providers](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers).

Azure Monitor similarly organizes core monitoring data into metrics and logs based on resource types, also called *namespaces*. Different metrics and logs are available for different resource types. Your service might be associated with more than one resource type.

For more information about resource types in AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

## Data storage

For Azure Monitor:

- Metrics data is stored in the Azure Monitor metrics database.
- Log data is stored in the Azure Monitor logs store. Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that can query this store.
- The Azure activity log is a separate store with its own interface in the Azure portal.

You can optionally route metric and activity log data to the Azure Monitor logs store. You can then use Log Analytics to query the data and correlate it with other log data.

Many services can use diagnostic settings to send metric and log data to other storage locations outside Azure Monitor. Examples include Azure Storage, [hosted partner systems](/en-us/azure/partner-solutions/overview), and [non-Azure partner systems, by using Event Hubs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

For detailed information on how Azure Monitor stores data, see [Azure Monitor data platform](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform).

## Azure Monitor platform metrics

Azure Monitor provides platform metrics for most services. These metrics are:

- Individually defined for each namespace.
- Stored in the Azure Monitor time-series metrics database.
- Lightweight and capable of supporting near real-time alerting.
- Used to track the performance of a resource over time.

**Collection:** Azure Monitor collects platform metrics automatically. No configuration is required.

**Routing:** You can also route some platform metrics to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics so you can query them with other log data. Check the **DS export** setting for each metric to see if you can use a diagnostic setting to route the metric to Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics.

- For more information, see the
[Metrics diagnostic setting](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#metrics). - To configure diagnostic settings for a service, see
[Create diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/create-diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all metrics it's possible to gather for all resources in Azure Monitor, see [Supported metrics in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

For a list of metrics you can collect for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#metrics).

Metrics play an important role in monitoring clusters, identifying issues, and optimizing performance in AKS clusters. Platform metrics are captured using the out-of-the-box metrics server installed in the `kube-system`

namespace, which periodically scrapes metrics from all AKS nodes served by kubelet. You should also enable managed service for Prometheus metrics to collect container metrics and Kubernetes object metrics, including object deployment state.

You can view the [list of default managed service for Prometheus metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default).

For more information, see [Collect managed service for Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana).

## Non-Azure Monitor based metrics

This service provides other metrics that aren't included in the Azure Monitor metrics database.

You can use the following Azure services and Azure Monitor features to monitor your AKS clusters. You enable these features when you create an AKS cluster.

In the Azure portal, use the **Integrations** tab, or use the Azure CLI, Terraform, or Azure Policy. In some cases, you can onboard your cluster to a monitoring service or feature after you create the cluster. Each service or feature might incur cost, so see the pricing information for each component before you enable it.

| Service or feature | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Monitor Agent](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview)to collect`stdout`

and `stderr`

logs and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. The feature supports a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview). You can enable monitoring for an AKS cluster when it's created using the[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks-policy), the Azure portal, or Terraform. If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see[Enable Container insights for AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks)for other options to enable it.Container insights stores most of its data in a

[Log Analytics workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview). You typically use the same Log Analytics workspace as the[resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs)for your cluster. For guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them, see[Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).[Managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It's the most common tool to use to collect and analyze metric data from Kubernetes clusters. The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution. If you don't enable the managed service for Prometheus when you create your cluster, see[Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable#enable-prometheus-and-grafana)for other options to enable it.The managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor stores its data in an

[Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)that is[linked to a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can use Azure Managed Grafana to analyze the data.[Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview)[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Grafana is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable Azure Managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see[Link a Grafana workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage#link-a-grafana-workspace). You can link it to your Azure Monitor workspace so that it can access Prometheus metrics from your cluster.### AKS control plane metrics monitoring (preview)


Prerequisites and scope: This preview feature is available for AKS clusters running Kubernetes 1.27 or later and requires the managed service for Prometheus to be enabled on your cluster. The feature currently supports Linux and Windows node pools but is not compatible with Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS).

AKS also exposes metrics from critical control plane components like the API server, etcd, and the scheduler through the managed service for Prometheus in Azure Monitor. Currently, this feature is in preview. For more information, see [Monitor AKS control plane metrics](control-plane-metrics-monitor). A subset of control plane metrics for the API server and etcd are available free through [Azure Monitor platform metrics](monitor-aks-reference#metrics). These metrics are collected by default. You can use the metrics to create alerts.

## Azure Monitor resource logs

Resource logs provide insight into operations that were done by an Azure resource. Logs are generated automatically, but you must route them to Azure Monitor logs to save or query them. Logs are organized in categories. A given namespace might have multiple resource log categories.

**Collection:** Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a *diagnostic setting* and route the logs to one or more locations. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. There are multiple ways to create and maintain diagnostic settings, including the Azure portal, programmatically, and though Azure Policy.

**Routing:** The suggested default is to route resource logs to Azure Monitor Logs so you can query them with other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information, see [Azure resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) and [Resource log destinations](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destinations).

For detailed information about collecting, storing, and routing resource logs, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings).

For a list of all available resource log categories in Azure Monitor, see [Supported resource logs in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-logs/logs-index).

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same header fields, followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema).

For the available resource log categories, their associated Log Analytics tables, and log schemas for AKS, see the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

### AKS control plane resource logs


Prerequisites: Requires a Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as your AKS cluster. Resource logs incur ingestion and retention costs in the destination workspace. For cost optimization, use resource-specific mode and configure Basic logs tier for audit tables.

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs) in Azure Monitor. Resource logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting to route them to at least one location. You typically send resource logs to a Log Analytics workspace, where most data for Container insights is stored.

To learn how to create a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, see [Create diagnostic settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings). When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

Warning

You can incur substantial cost when you collect resource logs for AKS, particularly for *kube-audit* logs. Consider the following recommendations to reduce the amount of data collected:

- Disable
`kube-audit`

logging when not required. - Enable collection from
`kube-audit-admin`

, which excludes the`get`

and`list`

audit events. - Enable resource-specific logs as described in this article, and configure the
**AKSAudit**table as[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans).

For more monitoring recommendations, see [Monitor AKS clusters using Azure services and cloud-native tools](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes). For strategies to reduce your monitoring costs, see [Cost optimization and Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-cost).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#resource-specific) for resource logs. Azure diagnostics mode sends all data to the [AzureDiagnostics table](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics). Resource-specific mode specifies the tables in the Log Analytics workspace where the data is sent. It also sends data to [ AKSAudit](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksaudit),

[, and](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/aksauditadmin)

`AKSAuditAdmin`

[as shown in the table in](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/akscontrolplane)

`AKSControlPlane`

[Resource logs](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs).

We recommend that you use resource-specific mode for AKS for the following reasons:

- Data is easier to query because it's in individual tables that are dedicated to AKS.
- Resource-specific mode supports configuration as
[Basic logs](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-table-plans)for significant cost savings.

For more information on the difference between collection modes, including how to change an existing setting, see [Select the collection mode](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#select-the-collection-mode).

Note

You can configure diagnostic settings using the Azure CLI. This approach isn't guaranteed to be successful because it doesn't check for the cluster's provisioning state. After you change diagnostic settings, check to be sure that the cluster reflects the setting changes.

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --name AKS-Diagnostics --resource /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my-cluster --logs '[{"category": "kube-audit","enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-audit-admin", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-apiserver", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "kube-scheduler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cluster-autoscaler", "enabled": true}, {"category": "cloud-controller-manager", "enabled": true}, {"category": "guard", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azuredisk-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-azurefile-controller", "enabled": true}, {"category": "csi-snapshot-controller", "enabled": true}]' --workspace /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/myresourcegroup/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/myworkspace --export-to-resource-specific true
```


#### AKS resource log queries and examples


Query scope requirements: When you selectLogson an AKS cluster menu, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current cluster. Log queries include data only from that resource. To run queries that include data from other clusters or Azure services, selectLogsfrom theAzure Monitormenu.

If the [diagnostic settings for your cluster](monitor-aks-reference#resource-logs) use Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs for AKS are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. Identify logs via the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](monitor-aks-reference).

| Description | Mode | Log query |
|---|---|---|
| Count logs for each category | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS"` | `summarize count() by Category` |
| All API server logs | Azure diagnostics mode | `AzureDiagnostics` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| All kube-audit logs in a time range | Azure diagnostics mode | `let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23");` `let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24");` `AzureDiagnostics` | `where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)` | `where Category == "kube-audit"` | `extend event = parse_json(log_s)` | `extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)` | `extend User = tostring(event.user.username)` | `extend Apiserver = pod_s` | `extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])` | `project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event` |
| All audit logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSAudit` |
All audit logs excluding the `get` and `list` audit events |
Resource-specific mode | `AKSAuditAdmin` |
| All API server logs | Resource-specific mode | `AKSControlPlane` | `where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |

To access a set of prebuilt queries in the Log Analytics workspace, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries#queries-interface), and select the **Kubernetes Services** resource type. For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

#### AKS audit policy

AKS uses a Kubernetes [audit policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) to control what events are logged and what data they contain. The policy defines rules that determine the audit level for different types of API requests based on users, resources, namespaces, and verbs. The following audit levels are used:

**None**: Events matching this rule aren't logged.**Metadata**: Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb) but not request or response body.**Request**: Log event metadata and request body but not response body.**RequestResponse**: Log event metadata, request and response bodies.

The following table summarizes the key audit policy rules applied in AKS:

| Audit level | Description | Example events |
|---|---|---|
None |
High-volume, low-risk read operations | `aksService` user `get` /`list` operations, `kube-proxy` watch on endpoints/services, kubelet `get` on nodes/node status, health check URLs (`/healthz*` , `/version` , `/swagger*` ) |
Metadata |
System events, events resources (except creates/updates in `default` /`kube-system` ), secrets, configmaps, service accounts, token reviews |
Token reviews, secret/configmap access, large CRDs like `installations.operator.tigera.io` |
Request |
Node and pod status updates from kubelets/nodes, delete collection operations, CRD updates for volume snapshots, read operations (`get` /`list` /`watch` ) on core API groups, VPA changes |
Kubelet status updates, namespace deletions, VPA checkpoint updates |
RequestResponse |
CoreDNS custom configmap updates, Fleet API operations, Karpenter resource changes, all other write operations on core API groups | CoreDNS configuration changes, Fleet member cluster operations, Karpenter node pool changes |

The complete audit policy used in AKS is available for review in the following collapsible section.

Note

The audit policy is managed by AKS and can't be customized. The policy is designed to balance security observability with performance and cost optimization by reducing log volume for high-frequency, low-risk operations.

### AKS data plane Container insights logs


Prerequisites and configuration requirements: Container insights requires a Log Analytics workspace for log storage and supports both managed identity and legacy authentication methods. For new clusters, managed identity authentication is recommended. Data collection can be customized using Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control costs and reduce ingestion volume.

Container insights collects various types of telemetry data from containers and AKS clusters to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and gain insights into your containerized applications running in your AKS clusters. For a list of tables and their detailed descriptions used by Container insights, see the [Azure Monitor table reference](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-logs-tables). All the tables are available for [log queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview).

Use [cost optimization settings](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-cost-config) to customize and control the metrics data collected through the Container insights agent. This feature supports the data collection settings for individual table selection, data collection intervals, and namespaces to exclude the data collection through [Azure Monitor Data Collection Rules (DCRs)](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview). These settings control the volume of ingestion and reduce the monitoring costs of Container insights. You can customize Container insights collected data in the Azure portal using the following options. Selecting any options other than **All (Default)** makes the Container insights experience unavailable.

| Grouping | Tables | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All (Default) | All standard Container insights tables | Required to enable the default Container insights visualizations. |
| Performance | Perf, InsightsMetrics | N/A |
| Logs and events | ContainerLog or ContainerLogV2, KubeEvents, KubePodInventory | Recommended if you enabled managed service for Prometheus metrics. |
| Workloads, Deployments, and HPAs | InsightsMetrics, KubePodInventory, KubeEvents, ContainerInventory, ContainerNodeInventory, KubeNodeInventory, KubeServices | N/A |
| Persistent Volumes | InsightsMetrics, KubePVInventory | N/A |

The **Logs and events** grouping captures the logs from the **ContainerLog** or **ContainerLogV2**, **KubeEvents**, and **KubePodInventory** tables, but not the metrics. The recommended path to collect metrics is to enable the [managed service for Prometheus](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview) from your AKS cluster and use [Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) for data visualization. For more information, see [Manage an Azure Monitor workspace](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage).

#### ContainerLogV2 schema


Compatibility and configuration requirements: ContainerLogV2 schema is recommended for new Container insights deployments using managed identity authentication via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Bicep, Terraform, Azure Policy, or the Azure portal. The schema is compatible with Basic logs tier for cost savings and doesn't affect analytics or alerts functionality. For more information about how to enable ContainerLogV2 through either the cluster's DCR or configmap, see[Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema].

Container insights in Azure Monitor provides a recommended schema for container logs, *ContainerLogV2*. The format includes the following fields for common queries to view data related to AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters:

**ContainerName****PodName****PodNamespace**

## Azure activity log

The activity log contains subscription-level events that track operations for each Azure resource as seen from outside that resource; for example, creating a new resource or starting a virtual machine.

**Collection:** Activity log events are automatically generated and collected in a separate store for viewing in the Azure portal.

**Routing:** You can send activity log data to Azure Monitor Logs so you can analyze it alongside other log data. Other locations such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, and certain Microsoft monitoring partners are also available. For more information on how to route the activity log, see [Overview of the Azure activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).

## View AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics in real time


Prerequisites and setup requirements: Live data feature requires Container insights to be enabled on your cluster and uses direct Kubernetes API access. For private clusters, access requires a computer in the same private network as the cluster. Authentication follows the Kubernetes RBAC model and requires appropriate cluster permissions.

You can view AKS container logs, events, and pod metrics using the *live data* feature in Container insights and troubleshoot issues in real time with direct access to `kubectl logs -c`

, `kubectl get`

events, and `kubectl top pods`

.

Note

AKS uses [Kubernetes cluster-level logging architectures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#cluster-level-logging-architectures). The container logs are located at `/var/log/containers`

on the node. To access a node, see [Connect to AKS cluster nodes](node-access).

To learn how to set up this feature, see [Configure live data in Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-livedata-setup). The feature directly accesses the Kubernetes API. For more information about the authentication model, see the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/).

### View AKS resource live logs


Private cluster network requirements: To access logs from a private cluster, you must use a computer that's in the same private network as the cluster.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your AKS cluster.Under

**Kubernetes resources**, select**Workloads**.For

**Deployment**,**Pod**,**Replica Set**,**Stateful Set**,**Job**, or**Cron Job**, select a value, and then select**Live Logs**.Select a resource log to view.

The following example shows the logs for a pod resource:

There are many tools for analyzing monitoring data.

### Azure Monitor tools

Azure Monitor supports the following basic tools:

[Metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to view and analyze metrics for Azure resources. For more information, see[Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).[Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace), a tool in the Azure portal that allows you to query and analyze log data by using the[Kusto query language (KQL)](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query). For more information, see[Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/get-started-queries).The

[activity log](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log), which has a user interface in the Azure portal for viewing and basic searches. To do more in-depth analysis, you have to route the data to Azure Monitor logs and run more complex queries in Log Analytics.

Tools that allow more complex visualization include:

[Dashboards](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/tutorial-logs-dashboards)that let you combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal.[Workbooks](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview), customizable reports that you can create in the Azure portal. Workbooks can include text, metrics, and log queries.[Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin), an open platform tool that excels in operational dashboards. You can use Grafana to create dashboards that include data from multiple sources other than Azure Monitor.[Power BI](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-powerbi), a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations across various data sources. You can configure Power BI to automatically import log data from Azure Monitor to take advantage of these visualizations.

### Azure Monitor export tools

You can get data out of Azure Monitor into other tools by using the following methods:

**Metrics:**Use the[REST API for metrics](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/operation-groups)to extract metric data from the Azure Monitor metrics database. The API supports filter expressions to refine the data retrieved. For more information, see[Azure Monitor REST API reference](/en-us/rest/api/monitor/filter-syntax).**Logs:**Use the REST API or the[associated client libraries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/api/overview).Another option is the

[workspace data export](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export?tabs=portal).

To get started with the REST API for Azure Monitor, see

[Azure monitoring REST API walkthrough](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/rest-api-walkthrough?tabs=portal).

### Monitor AKS clusters in the Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** pane for your AKS cluster resource offers a quick way to start viewing monitoring data in the Azure portal. This tab includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool. You can select any of these graphs to further analyze the data in the [metrics explorer](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started).

The **Monitoring** tab also includes links to the [Azure managed service for Prometheus](#integrations) and [Container insights](#integrations) for the cluster. You can enable these tools on the **Monitoring** tab. You might also see a banner at the top of the pane that recommends other features to improve monitoring for your cluster.

Tip

To access monitoring features for all AKS clusters in your subscription, on the Azure portal home page, select **Azure Monitor**.

## Kusto queries

You can analyze monitoring data in the Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics store by using the Kusto query language (KQL).

Important

When you select **Logs** from the service's menu in the portal, Log Analytics opens with the query scope set to the current service. This scope means that log queries will only include data from that type of resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/scope) for details.

For a list of common queries for any service, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/queries).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when specific conditions are found in your monitoring data. Alerts allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. For more information, see [Azure Monitor alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview).

There are many sources of common alerts for Azure resources. For examples of common alerts for Azure resources, see [Sample log alert queries](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-log-alert-query-samples). The [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://aka.ms/amba) site provides a semi-automated method of implementing important platform metric alerts, dashboards, and guidelines. The site applies to a continually expanding subset of Azure services, including all services that are part of the Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption of Azure Monitor alert notifications. For more information, see [Common alert schema](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

### Types of alerts

You can alert on any metric or log data source in the Azure Monitor data platform. There are many different types of alerts depending on the services you're monitoring and the monitoring data you're collecting. Different types of alerts have various benefits and drawbacks. For more information, see [Choose the right monitoring alert type](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types).

The following list describes the types of Azure Monitor alerts you can create:

[Metric alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#metric-alerts)evaluate resource metrics at regular intervals. Metrics can be platform metrics, custom metrics, logs from Azure Monitor converted to metrics, or Application Insights metrics. Metric alerts can also apply multiple conditions and dynamic thresholds.[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts)allow users to use a Log Analytics query to evaluate resource logs at a predefined frequency.[Activity log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#activity-log-alerts)trigger when a new activity log event occurs that matches defined conditions. Resource Health alerts and Service Health alerts are activity log alerts that report on your service and resource health.

Some Azure services also support [smart detection alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#smart-detection-alerts), [Prometheus alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#prometheus-alerts), or [recommended alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

For some services, you can monitor at scale by applying the same metric alert rule to multiple resources of the same type that exist in the same Azure region. Individual notifications are sent for each monitored resource. For supported Azure services and clouds, see [Monitor multiple resources with one alert rule](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#monitor-multiple-resources-with-one-alert-rule).

### Recommended alert rules

For some Azure services, you can [enable recommended out-of-the-box alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-manage-alert-rules#enable-recommended-alert-rules-in-the-azure-portal).

The system compiles a list of recommended alert rules based on:

- The resource provider's knowledge of important signals and thresholds for monitoring the resource.
- Data that tells what customers commonly alert on for this resource.

Note

Recommended alert rules are available for:

- Virtual machines
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Log Analytics workspaces

### Configure Prometheus metrics-based alerts


Download and configuration requirements: Alert rules are available as downloadable ARM templates or Bicep files. Before configuring alerts, ensure the managed service for Prometheus is enabled on your cluster and an Azure Monitor workspace is properly linked to your AKS cluster.

When you [enable collection of the managed service for Prometheus metrics](#integrations) for your cluster, you can download a collection of [recommended managed service for Prometheus alert rules](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

The download includes the following rules:

| Level | Alerts |
|---|---|
| Cluster level | `KubeCPUQuotaOvercommit` `KubeMemoryQuotaOvercommit` `KubeContainerOOMKilledCount` `KubeClientErrors` `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeInodesFillingUp` `KubePersistentVolumeErrors` `KubeContainerWaiting` `KubeDaemonSetNotScheduled` `KubeDaemonSetMisScheduled` `KubeQuotaAlmostFull` |
| Node level | `KubeNodeUnreachable` `KubeNodeReadinessFlapping` |
| Pod level | `KubePVUsageHigh` `KubeDeploymentReplicasMismatch` `KubeStatefulSetReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaReplicasMismatch` `KubeHpaMaxedOut` `KubePodCrashLooping` `KubeJobStale` `KubePodContainerRestart` `KubePodReadyStateLow` `KubePodFailedState` `KubePodNotReadyByController` `KubeStatefulSetGenerationMismatch` `KubeJobFailed` `KubeContainerAverageCPUHigh` `KubeContainerAverageMemoryHigh` `KubeletPodStartUpLatencyHigh` |

For more information, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts) and [Query logs from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-query).

[Log alerts](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log) can measure two types of information to help you monitor diverse scenarios:

[Result count](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#result-count): Counts the number of rows returned by the query. Use this information to work with events like Windows event logs, syslog events, and application exceptions.[Calculation of a value](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log#calculation-of-a-value): Makes a calculation based on a numeric column. Use this information to include diverse resources. An example is CPU percentage.

Most log queries compare a `DateTime`

value to the present time using the `now`

operator and going back one hour. To learn how to build log-based alerts, see [Create log alerts from Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-log-alerts).

### AKS alert rules

The following table lists some suggested alert rules for AKS. These alerts are only examples. You can set alerts for any metric, log entry, or activity log entry listed in the [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference).

| Condition | Description |
|---|---|
CPU Usage Percentage > 95 |
Alerts when the average CPU usage across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |
Memory Working Set Percentage > 100 |
Alerts when the average working set across all nodes exceeds the threshold. |

### Advisor recommendations

For some services, if critical conditions or imminent changes occur during resource operations, an alert displays on the service **Overview** page in the portal. You can find more information and recommended fixes for the alert in **Advisor recommendations** under **Monitoring** in the left menu. During normal operations, no advisor recommendations display.

For more information on Azure Advisor, see [Azure Advisor overview](/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).

Note

If you're creating or running an application that runs on your service, [Azure Monitor application insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) might offer more types of alerts.

## AKS node network metrics monitoring


Version and enablement requirements: In Kubernetes version 1.29 and later, node network metrics are enabled by default for all clusters that have Azure Monitor enabled. For earlier Kubernetes versions, you must manually enable network monitoring through cluster configuration. This feature requires Azure Monitor or Container insights to be configured on your cluster.

Node network metrics are crucial for maintaining a healthy and performant Kubernetes cluster. By collecting and analyzing data about network traffic, you can gain valuable insights about your cluster's operation and identify potential issues before they lead to outages or performance loss.

The following node network metrics are enabled by default and are aggregated per node. All metrics include the labels cluster and instance (node name). You can easily view these metrics using the Managed Grafana dashboard under **Azure Managed Prometheus** > **Kubernetes** > **Networking** > **Clusters**.

### AKS node network metrics by data plane type

All metrics include these labels:

`cluster`

`instance`

(node name)


OS support and limitations: For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux node pools. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics. Ensure your cluster has Linux node pools for full Cilium metrics availability.

For Cilium data plane scenarios, the Container Network Observability feature provides metrics only for Linux. Currently, Windows isn't supported for Container Network Observability metrics.

Cilium exposes several metrics that Container Network Observability uses:

| Metric name | Description | Extra labels | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`cilium_forward_count_total` |
Total forwarded packet count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_forward_bytes_total` |
Total forwarded byte count | `direction` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_count_total` |
Total dropped packet count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |
`cilium_drop_bytes_total` |
Total dropped byte count | `direction` , `reason` |
Supported ✅ | Unsupported ❌ |

### Disable AKS node network metrics collection

You can disable network metrics collection on specific nodes by adding the label `networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled`

to those nodes.

Note

Retina has an `operator: "Exists"`

`effect: NoSchedule`

toleration, so it bypasses `NoSchedule`

taints. Therefore, labels are used instead of taints to control scheduling.

If the cluster is `autoprovisioning/autoscaling`

nodes, you need to manually enable the flag on each node.

Important

This feature isn't applicable if Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) is enabled on your cluster.

To disable metrics collection on a node:

```
kubectl label node <node-name> networking.azure.com/node-network-metrics=disabled
```


For detailed pod-level and DNS metrics, see [Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview).
