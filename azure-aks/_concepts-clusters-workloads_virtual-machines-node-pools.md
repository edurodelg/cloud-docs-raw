This article describes core concepts of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and operate containerized applications at scale on Azure.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## What is AKS?

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications that use Kubernetes. For more information, see [What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?](what-is-aks).

## Cluster components

An AKS cluster is divided into two main components:

**Control plane**: The control plane provides the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.**Nodes**: Nodes are the underlying virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

Note

AKS managed components have the label `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby`

: `aks`

.

AKS manages the Helm releases with the prefix `aks-managed`

. Continuously increasing revisions on these releases are expected and safe.

### Control plane

The Azure managed control plane is composed of several components that help manage the cluster:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kube-apiserver` |
The API server (
|

`etcd`

[etcd](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd)helps to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.`kube-scheduler`

[kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)) helps to make scheduling decisions. It watches for new pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.`kube-controller-manager`

[kube-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)) runs controller processes, such as noticing and responding when nodes go down.`cloud-controller-manager`

[cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#cloud-controller-manager)) embeds cloud-specific control logic to run controllers specific to the cloud provider.### Nodes

Each AKS cluster has at least one node, which is an Azure VM that runs Kubernetes node components. The following components run on each node:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
`kubelet` |
The
|

`kube-proxy`

[kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-proxy)is a network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes.`container runtime`

[container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime)manages the execution and lifecycle of containers.## Node configuration

Configure the following settings for nodes.

### VM size and image

The *Azure VM size* for your nodes defines CPUs, memory, size, and the storage type available, such as a high-performance solid-state drive or a regular hard-disk drive. The VM size you choose depends on the workload requirements and the number of pods that you plan to run on each node. As of May 2025, the default VM SKU and size will be dynamically selected by AKS based on available capacity and quota if the parameter is left blank during deployment. For more information, see [Supported VM sizes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](quotas-skus-regions#supported-vm-sizes).

In AKS, the *VM image* for your cluster's nodes is based on Ubuntu Linux, [Azure Linux](use-azure-linux), or Windows Server 2022. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform automatically creates and configures the requested number of VMs. Agent nodes are billed as standard VMs. Any VM size discounts, including [Azure reservations](/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations), are automatically applied.

### OS disks

Default OS disk sizing is used on new clusters or node pools only when a default OS disk size isn't specified. This behavior applies to both managed and ephemeral OS disks. For more information, see [Default OS disk sizing](concepts-storage#default-os-disk-sizing).

### Resource reservations

AKS uses node resources to help the nodes function as part of the cluster. This usage can cause a discrepancy between the node's total resources and the allocatable resources in AKS. To maintain node performance and functionality, AKS reserves two types of resources, CPU and memory, on each node. For more information, see [Resource reservations in AKS](node-resource-reservations).

### OS

AKS supports two linux distros: Ubuntu and Azure Linux. Ubuntu is the default Linux distro on AKS. Windows node pools are also supported on AKS with the [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](/en-us/windows-server/get-started/servicing-channels-comparison) as the default channel on AKS. For more information on default OS versions, see documentation on [node images](node-images).

### Container runtime

A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. The runtime helps abstract away system calls or OS-specific functionality to run containers on Linux or Windows. For Linux node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is used on Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher. For Windows Server 2019 and 2022 node pools, [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is generally available and is the only runtime option on Kubernetes version 1.23 and higher.

## Pods

A *pod* is a group of one or more containers that share the same network and storage resources and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods typically have a 1:1 mapping with a container, but you can run multiple containers in a pod.

## Node pools

In AKS, nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. These node pools contain the underlying virtual machine scale sets and virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications.

When you create an AKS cluster, you define the initial number of nodes and their size (version), which creates a [system node pool](use-system-pools). System node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting critical system pods, such as CoreDNS and `konnectivity`

.

To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, you can create *user node pools*. User node pools serve the primary purpose of hosting your application pods.

For more information, see [Create node pools in AKS](create-node-pools) and [Manage node pools in AKS](manage-node-pools).

## Node resource group

When you create an AKS cluster in an Azure resource group, the AKS resource provider automatically creates a second resource group called the *node resource group*. This resource group contains all the infrastructure resources associated with the cluster, including VMs, virtual machine scale sets, and storage.

For more information, see the following resources:

[Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](faq)[Can I provide my own name for the AKS node resource group?](faq)[Can I modify tags and other properties of the resources in the AKS node resource group?](faq)

## Namespaces

Kubernetes resources, such as pods and deployments, are logically grouped into *namespaces* to divide an AKS cluster and create, view, or manage access to resources.

The following namespaces are created by default in an AKS cluster:

| Namespace | Description |
|---|---|
`default` |
The
|

`kube-node-lease`

[kube-node-lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace enables nodes to communicate their availability to the control plane.`kube-public`

[kube-public](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace isn't typically used, but you can use it so that resources are visible across the whole cluster by any user.`kube-system`

[kube-system](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces)namespace is used by Kubernetes to manage cluster resources, such as`coredns`

, `konnectivity-agent`

, and `metrics-server`

. It is not recommended to deploy your own applications to this namespace. For rare cases where deploying your own applications to this namespace is necessary, see the [FAQ](faq#can-admission-controller-webhooks-affect-kube-system-and-internal-aks-namespaces-)to learn how.## Cluster modes

In AKS, you can create a cluster with the Automatic or Standard mode. AKS Automatic provides a more fully managed experience. You can manage cluster configuration, including nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings. AKS Standard provides more control over the cluster configuration, including the ability to manage node pools, scaling, and other settings.

For more information, see [AKS Automatic and Standard feature comparison](intro-aks-automatic#aks-automatic-and-standard-feature-comparison).

## Pricing tiers

AKS offers three pricing tiers for cluster management: Free, Standard, and Premium. The pricing tier you choose determines the features that are available for managing your cluster.

For more information, see [Pricing tiers for AKS cluster management](free-standard-pricing-tiers).

## Supported Kubernetes versions

For more information, see [Supported Kubernetes versions in AKS](supported-kubernetes-versions).

# Use Virtual Machines node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this article, you'll learn about the new Virtual Machines node pool type for AKS.

With Virtual Machines node pools, AKS directly manages the provisioning and bootstrapping of every single node. For Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools, AKS manages the model of the Virtual Machine Scale Sets and uses it to achieve consistency across all nodes in the node pool. Virtual Machines node pools enable you to orchestrate your cluster with virtual machines that best fit your individual workloads.

## Overview

### How it works

A node pool consists of a set of virtual machines, where different virtual machine sizes are designated to support different types of workloads. These virtual machine sizes, referred to as SKUs, are categorized into different families that are optimized for specific purposes. For more information, see [VM SKUs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview).

To enable scaling of multiple virtual machine sizes, the Virtual Machines node pool type uses a `ScaleProfile`

that contains configurations indicating how the node pool can scale, specifically the desired list of virtual machine size and the count of each size. A `ManualScaleProfile`

is a scale profile that specifies one desired virtual machine size and the total count of that type in the nodepool. Only one virtual machine size is allowed in a `ManualScaleProfile`

. You need to create a separate `ManualScaleProfile`

for each virtual machine size in your node pool. When creating a new Virtual Machines node pool, you add an initial manual scale profile for a virtual machine size using the `vm-size`

field and including a `node-count`

, per the instructions below. You can also add additional manual scale profiles following the instructions for [adding manual scale profiles](/en-us/azure/aks/virtual-machines-node-pools#add-a-manual-scale-profile-to-a-node-pool).

Note

When creating a new Virtual Machines node pool, you can have multiple scale profiles, and you need at least one manual scale profile in your nodepool.

### Advantages

Advantages of the Virtual Machines node pool type include:

**Flexibility**: Node specifications can be updated to adapt to your current workload and needs.**Fine-tuned control**: Single node-level controls allow specifying and mixing nodes of different specs to lift restrictions from a single model and improve consistency.**Efficiency**: You can reduce the node footprint for your cluster, simplifying your operational requirements.

Virtual Machines node pools provide a better experience for dynamic workloads and high availability requirements. Virtual Machines node pools enable you to set up multiple similar-family virtual machines in one node pool. Your workload will be automatically scheduled on the available resources that you configure.

### Feature comparison

The following table highlights how Virtual Machines node pools compare with standard [Scale Set](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes) node pools.

| Node pool type | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Virtual Machines node pool | You can add, remove, or update nodes in a node pool. Virtual machine types can be any virtual machine of the same family type (for example, D-series, A-Series, etc.). |
| Virtual Machine Scale Set based node pool | You can add or remove nodes of the same size and type in a node pool. If you add a new virtual machine size to the cluster, you need to create a new node pool. |

### Limitations

[Cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview)is currently not supported.[InifiniBand](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/enable-infiniband)isn't available.[Node pool snapshot](node-pool-snapshot)isn't supported.- All VM sizes selected in a node pool need to be from a similar virtual machine family. For example, you can't mix an N-Series virtual machine type with a D-Series virtual machine type in the same node pool.
- Virtual Machines node pools allow up to five different virtual machine sizes per node pool.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can
[create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run
`az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli#install-azure-cli) - This feature requires kubernetes version 1.27 or greater. To upgrade your kubernetes version, see
[Upgrade AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster)

## Create an AKS cluster with Virtual Machines node pools

Note

Only *one* VM size is allowed in a scale profile, and the maximum limit is *five* VM scale profiles overall for a Virtual Machines node pool.

Create an AKS cluster with Virtual Machines node pools using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.The following example creates a cluster named

*myAKSCluster*with a Virtual Machines node pool containing two nodes, generates SSH keys, sets the load balancer SKU to*standard*, and sets the Kubernetes version to*1.31.0*:`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" --node-count 2 \ --kubernetes-version 1.31.0`


## Create a cluster with Windows enabled and a Windows Virtual Machine node pool

Virtual Machine node pools are available in Windows enabled clusters. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with a Virtual Machines node pool. These steps create a Linux system pool at first.

Create a username to use as administrator credentials for the Windows Server nodes on your cluster. The following commands prompt you for a username and sets it to

*WINDOWS_USERNAME*for use in a later command.`echo "Please enter the username to use as administrator credentials for Windows Server nodes on your cluster: " && read WINDOWS_USERNAME`

Create a password for the administrator username you created in the previous step. The password must be a minimum of 14 characters and meet the

[Windows Server password complexity requirements](/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements#reference).`echo "Please enter the password to use as administrator credentials for Windows Server nodes on your cluster: " && read WINDOWS_PASSWORD`

Create an AKS cluster with Windows enabled and Virtual Machines type node pools using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 2 \ --enable-addons monitoring \ --generate-ssh-keys \ --windows-admin-username $WINDOWS_USERNAME \ --windows-admin-password $WINDOWS_PASSWORD \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --network-plugin azure`

Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing Windows enabled cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

. The following example adds a Virtual Machines node pool named*npwin*to the*myAKSCluster*cluster:`az aks nodepool add --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --os-type Windows \ --name npwin \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D2s_V3" \ --node-count 1 --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines"`


## Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing cluster

Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.The following example adds a Virtual Machines node pool named

*myvmpool*to the*myAKSCluster*cluster. The node pool creates a ManualScaleProfile with`--vm-sizes`

set to*Standard_D4s_v3*and a`--node-count`

of 3:`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" \ --node-count 3`


## Add a manual scale profile to a node pool

Add a manual scale profile to a node pool using the

with the`az aks nodepool manual-scale add`

`--vm-sizes`

flag set to`"Standard_D2s_v3"`

and the`node-count`

set to 2.The following example adds a manual scale profile to node pool

*myvmpool*in cluster*myAKSCluster*. The node pool includes two nodes with a VM SKU of*Standard_D2s_v3*:`az aks nodepool manual-scale add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D2s_v3" \ --node-count 2`


## Update an existing manual scale profile

Update an existing manual scale profile in a node pool using the

command with the`az aks nodepool manual-scale update`

`--vm-sizes`

flag set to`"Standard_D2s_v3"`

.Note

Use the

`--current-vm-sizes`

parameter to specify the size of the existing node pool that you want to update. You can update`--vm-sizes`

and/or`--node-count`

. When using other tools or REST APIs, you need to pass in a full`agentPoolProfiles.virtualMachinesProfile.scale`

field when updating the node pool scale profile.The following example updates a manual scale profile to the

*myvmpool*node pool in the*myAKSCluster*cluster. The command updates the number of nodes to five and changes the VM SKU from*Standard_D4s_v3*to*Standard_D8s_v3*:`az aks nodepool manual-scale update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --current-vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D8s_v3" \ --node-count 5`


## Delete a manual scale profile

Delete an existing manual scale profile using the

command.`az aks nodepool manual-scale delete`

Note

The

`--current-vm-sizes`

parameter specifies the size of the existing node pool to be deleted. When using other tools or REST APIs to update the node pool scale profile, pass in a full`agentPoolProfiles.virtualMachinesProfile.scale`

field.The following example deletes the manual scale profile for the

*Standard_D8s_v3*VM SKU in the*myvmpool*node pool.`az aks nodepool manual-scale delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --current-vm-sizes "Standard_D8s_v3"`
