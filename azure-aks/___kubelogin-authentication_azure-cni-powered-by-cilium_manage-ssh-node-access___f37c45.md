Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The kubelogin plugin in Azure is a client-go credential [plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins) that implements Microsoft Entra authentication. The kubelogin plugin offers features that aren't available in the kubectl command-line tool. For more information, see the [kubelogin introduction](https://azure.github.io/kubelogin/index.html) and the [kubectl introduction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/introduction/).

This article provides an overview and examples of how to use kubelogin for all supported Microsoft Entra authentication methods in AKS.

## Kubelogin authentication in AKS limitations

- Groups that are created in Microsoft Entra are included only by their
**ObjectID**value, and not by their display name. The`sAMAccountName`

command is available only for groups that are synchronized from on-premises Windows Server Active Directory.

- The service principal authentication method works only with managed Microsoft Entra, and not with the earlier version Azure Active Directory.
- The service principal can be a member of a maximum of 200
[Microsoft Entra groups](/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims). If you have more than 200 groups, consider using[application roles](/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-use-app-roles-customers).

- The device code authentication method doesn't work when a Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policy is set on a Microsoft Entra tenant. In that scenario, use web browser interactive authentication instead.

- The Azure CLI authentication method works only with AKS managed Microsoft Entra.

## How authentication works

Note

Keep in mind the following information about kubelogin authentication for AKS clusters integrated with Microsoft Entra:

**Clusters running Kubernetes version 1.24 or later**automatically use the kubelogin format.**Clusters running Kubernetes 1.24 or earlier**require manual conversion. You can use the device code authentication method to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin format.

For most interactions with kubelogin, you use the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand. The subcommand uses the kubeconfig file that's specified in `--kubeconfig`

or in the `KUBECONFIG`

environment variable to convert the final kubeconfig file to exec format based on the specified authentication method.

The authentication methods that kubelogin implements are Microsoft Entra OAuth 2.0 token grant flows. In each authentication method, the token isn't cached on the file system.

## Device code authentication

Device code is the default authentication method for the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand. This authentication method prompts the device code for the user to sign in from a browser session.

Note

Before the kubelogin and exec plugins were introduced, the Azure authentication method in kubectl supported only the device code flow. It used an earlier version of a library that produces a token that has the `audience`

claim with an `spn:`

prefix. It isn't compatible with [AKS managed Microsoft Entra](managed-azure-ad), which uses an [on-behalf-of (OBO)](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) flow. When you run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand, kubelogin removes the `spn:`

prefix from the audience claim.

### Parameters for device code authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with device code authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l devicecode` (optional) |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. This parameter is optional because device code is the default method. |
`--legacy` |
Uses legacy behavior for earlier versions of Azure Active Directory clusters. If you're using the kubeconfig file in an earlier version Azure Active Directory cluster, kubelogin automatically adds the `--legacy` flag. |
`--token-cache-dir` |
Overrides the default path of the token cache directory, which is ${HOME}/.kube/cache/kubelogin. |

## Azure CLI authentication

The Azure CLI (command: `-l azurecli`

) authentication method uses the signed-in context that the Azure CLI establishes to get the access token. The token is issued in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as `az login`

. kubelogin doesn't write tokens to the token cache file because the Azure CLI already manages them.

### Parameters for Azure CLI authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with Azure CLI authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l azurecli` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--azure-config-dir` |
Specifies the Azure CLI configuration directory. The default directory is ${HOME}/.azure. |

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to Azure using the [ az login](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively#interactive-login) command.

```
az login
```


## Web browser interactive authentication

The web browser interactive (command: `-l interactive`

) method of authentication automatically opens a web browser to sign in the user. After the user is authenticated, the browser redirects to the local web server using the verified credentials. This authentication method complies with Conditional Access policy.

You can use either a bearer token or a Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token with this authentication method.

### Parameters for bearer token authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with bearer token authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l interactive` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--token-cache-dir` |
Overrides the default path of the token cache directory, which is ${HOME}/.kube/cache/kubelogin. |

### Parameters for PoP token authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with PoP token authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l interactive` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--pop-enabled` |
Enables PoP token authentication. |
`--pop-claims` |
Specifies the PoP token claims in a key-value pair format. For example, `u=/ARM/ID/OF/CLUSTER` . |

## Service principal authentication

The service principal (command: `-l spn`

) authentication method uses a service principal to sign in the user. You can provide the credential by setting an environment variable or by using the credential in a command-line argument. The supported credentials that you can use are a password or a Personal Information Exchange (PFX) client certificate.

### Parameters for service principal authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with service principal authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l spn` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--client-id` |
The application ID (client-id) of the service principal. |
`--client-secret` |
The client secret of the service principal. |

## Managed identity authentication

Use the [managed identity](/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) (command: `-l msi`

) authentication method for applications that connect to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. Examples include accessing Azure resources like an Azure virtual machine (VM), a virtual machine scale set, or Azure Cloud Shell.

You can use the default managed identity that's assigned to the resource or a specific user-assigned managed identity.

### Parameters for managed identity authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with managed identity authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l msi` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |
`--client-id` |
The application ID (client-id) of the user-assigned managed identity. If you don't specify this parameter, the default managed identity is used. |

## Workload identity authentication

The workload identity (command: `-l workloadidentity`

) authentication method uses identity credentials that are federated with Microsoft Entra to authenticate access to AKS clusters. The method uses Microsoft Entra integrated authentication. It works by setting the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
`AZURE_CLIENT_ID` |
The Microsoft Entra application ID that is federated with the workload identity. |
`AZURE_TENANT_ID` |
The Microsoft Entra tenant ID. |
`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` |
The file that contains a signed assertion of the workload identity, like a Kubernetes projected service account (JWT) token. |
`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST` |
The base URL of a Microsoft Entra authority. For example, `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` . |

You can use a [workload identity](/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-overview) to access Kubernetes clusters from CI/CD systems like GitHub or ArgoCD without storing service principal credentials in the external systems. To configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation from GitHub, see the [OIDC federation example](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-azure).

### Parameters for workload identity authentication

The following table outlines parameters that you can use with workload identity authentication:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`-l workloadidentity` |
Specifies the kubelogin authentication method. |

## Export the kubeconfig file path

Before you run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand, export the kubeconfig file path to the `KUBECONFIG`

environment variable. For example:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
```


## Convert the kubeconfig file

Run the `convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin for your chosen authentication method.

```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig
```


```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l azurecli
```


```
# Bearer token authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l interactive
# Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l interactive --pop-enabled --pop-claims "u=/ARM/ID/OF/CLUSTER"
```


-
[Use environment variables](#tabpanel_1_environment-variables) -
[Use command-line arguments](#tabpanel_1_command-line-arguments) -
[Use a client certificate](#tabpanel_1_client-certificate) -
[Use a PoP token with environment variables](#tabpanel_1_pop-token-environment-variables)

Run the

`convert-kubeconfig`

subcommand to convert the kubeconfig file to use the exec plugin.`kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l spn`

Set the environment variables for the client ID and client secret or client certificate. For example:

`export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service-principal-client-id> export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<service-principal-client-secret>`


```
# Default managed identity authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l msi
# Specific managed identity authentication
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l msi --client-id <managed-identity-client-id>
```


```
kubelogin convert-kubeconfig -l workloadidentity
```


## Remove cached tokens

Remove cached tokens using the `kubelogin remove-tokens`

command.

```
kubelogin remove-tokens
```


## Get node information

Get node information using the `kubectl get`

command.

```
kubectl get nodes
```


## How to use kubelogin with AKS

AKS uses a pair of first-party Microsoft Entra applications. These application IDs are the same in all environments.

The AKS Microsoft Entra server application ID (server-id) that the server side uses is `6dae42f8-4368-4678-94ff-3960e28e3630`

. The access token that accesses AKS clusters must be issued for this application. In most kubelogin authentication methods, you must use `--server-id`

with `kubelogin get-token`

.

The AKS Microsoft Entra client application ID (client-id) that kubelogin uses to perform public client authentication on behalf of the user is `80faf920-1908-4b52-b5ef-a8e7bedfc67a`

. The client application ID is used in device code and web browser interactive authentication methods.

# Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium combines the robust control plane of Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) with the data plane of [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) to provide high-performance networking and security.

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium provides the following benefits by making use of eBPF programs loaded into the Linux kernel and a more efficient API object structure:

- Functionality equivalent to existing Azure CNI and Azure CNI Overlay plugins
- Improved service routing
- More efficient network policy enforcement
- Better observability of cluster traffic
- Support for larger clusters (more nodes, pods, and services)

## IP Address Management (IPAM) with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

You can deploy Azure CNI Powered by Cilium with two different methods for assigning pod IPs:

- Assign IP addresses from an overlay network (similar to Azure CNI Overlay mode)
- Assign IP addresses from a virtual network (similar to existing Azure CNI with Dynamic Pod IP Assignment)

If you aren't sure which option to select, read [Choose a network model](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay#choose-a-network-model)

## Versions

| Kubernetes Version | Minimum Cilium Version |
|---|---|
| 1.29 (LTS) | 1.14.19 |
| 1.30 | 1.14.19 |
| 1.31 | 1.16.6 |
| 1.32 | 1.17.0 |
| 1.33 | 1.17.0 |

For more information on AKS versioning and release timelines, see [Supported Kubernetes Versions](supported-kubernetes-versions).

## Network Policy Enforcement

Cilium enforces [network policies to allow or deny traffic between pods](operator-best-practices-network#control-traffic-flow-with-network-policies). With Cilium, you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

## Local Redirect Policy (LRP)

LRP starts to be supported from Kubernetes v1.29 and up, Cilium v1.14 and up. For LRP to work with Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) - FQDN Filtering, the Cilium Network Policy egress labels need to match with node-local DNS cache pod labels.

## Limitations

Azure CNI powered by Cilium currently has the following limitations:

- Available only for Linux and not for Windows.
- Network policies can't use
`ipBlock`

to allow access to node or pod IPs. For details and recommended workarounds, see[frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions). - For Cilium versions 1.16 or earlier, multiple Kubernetes services can't use the same host port with different protocols (for example, TCP or UDP) (
[Cilium issue #14287](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/14287)). - Network policies aren't applied to pods using host networking (
`spec.hostNetwork: true`

) because these pods use the host identity instead of having individual identities. - Cilium Endpoint Slices are supported in Kubernetes version 1.32 and above. Cilium Endpoint Slices don't support configuration of how Cilium Endpoints are grouped. Priority namespace through
`cilium.io/ces-namespace`

isn't supported. - L7 policy isn't supported by
`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

(CCNP). - Cilium uses Cilium identities as unique identity for provisioning endpoints, so high-churning workloads such as Spark jobs generate high count of Cilium identities. To avoid workloads hitting Cilium identity limits (65535), excluding Spark job's labels like
`!spark-app-name`

and`!spark-app-selector`

in the Cilium configmap can significantly reduce Cilium identity generation. For more details on Cilium identity exclusion rules, check[the official Cilium label documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/performance/scalability/identity-relevant-labels/#excluding-labels). - AKS Local DNS isn't compatible with Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) - FQDN Filtering.

## Considerations

To gain capabilities such as observability into your network traffic and security features like Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) based filtering and Layer 7 based network policies on your cluster, consider enabling [Advanced Container Networking services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview) on your clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.48.1 or later. Run
`az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using ARM templates or the REST API, the AKS API version must be
`2022-09-02-preview`

or later.

Previous AKS API versions (`2022-09-02preview`

to `2023-01-02preview`

) used the field [ networkProfile.ebpfDataplane=cilium](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2022-09-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L6939-L6955). AKS API versions since

`2023-02-02preview`

use the field [to enable Azure CNI Powered by Cilium.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2023-02-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L7152-L7173)

`networkProfile.networkDataplane=cilium`

## Create a new AKS Cluster with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

The following sections use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a cluster and assign IP addresses.

### Option 1: Assign IP addresses from an overlay network

Use the following commands to create a cluster with an overlay network and Cilium. Replace the values for `<clusterName>`

, `<resourceGroupName>`

, and `<location>`

:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


The `--network-dataplane cilium`

flag replaces the deprecated `--enable-ebpf-dataplane`

flag used in earlier versions of the aks-preview CLI extension.

### Option 2: Assign IP addresses from a virtual network

Run the following commands to create a resource group and virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods.

```
# Create the resource group
az group create --name <resourceGroupName> --location <location>
```


```
# Create a virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods
az network vnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --location <location> --name <vnetName> --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.0.0.0/8> -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name nodesubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.240.0.0/16> -o none
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name podsubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.241.0.0/16> -o none
```


Create the cluster using `--network-dataplane cilium`

:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--max-pods 250 \
--network-plugin azure \
--vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/nodesubnet \
--pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/podsubnet \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Option 3: Assign IP addresses from the Node Subnet

Azure CLI version 2.69.0 or later is required. Run `az --version`

to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Create a cluster using [node subnet](concepts-network-legacy-cni#azure-cni-node-subnet) with a Cilium data plane:

```
az aks create \
--name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--location <location> \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Frequently asked questions

**Can I customize Cilium configuration?**No, AKS manages the Cilium configuration and it can't be modified. We recommend that customers who require more control use

[AKS BYO CNI](use-byo-cni)and install Cilium manually.**Can I use**`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

custom resources instead of Kubernetes`NetworkPolicy`

resources?L3 and L4

`CiliumNetworkPolicy`

are supported and can be used alongside Kubernetes`NetworkPolicy`

resources.Customers might use FQDN filtering and Layer 7 policies as part of the

[Advanced Container Networking Services](advanced-container-networking-services-overview)feature bundle.**Can I use**`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

?Yes,

`CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy`

is supported. The following sample policy YAML shows configuring an L4 rule:`apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2" kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy metadata: name: "l4-rule-ingress-backend-frontend" spec: endpointSelector: matchLabels: role: backend ingress: - fromEndpoints: - matchLabels: role: frontend toPorts: - ports: - port: "80" protocol: TCP`

**Which Cilium features are supported in Azure managed CNI? Which of those require Advanced Container Networking Services?**Supported Feature w/o ACNS w/ ACNS Cilium Endpoint Slices ✔️ ✔️ K8s Network Policies ✔️ ✔️ Cilium L3/L4 Network Policies ✔️ ✔️ Cilium Clusterwide Network Policy ✔️ ✔️ FQDN Filtering ❌ ✔️ L7 Network Policies (HTTP/gRPC/Kafka) ❌ ✔️ Container Network Observability (Metrics and Flow logs) ❌ ✔️ eBPF Host Routing ❌ ✔️ **Why is traffic being blocked when the**`NetworkPolicy`

has an`ipBlock`

that allows the IP address?A limitation of Azure CNI Powered by Cilium is that a

`NetworkPolicy`

`ipBlock`

can't select pod or node IPs.For example, this

`NetworkPolicy`

has an`ipBlock`

that allows all egress to`0.0.0.0/0`

:`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: example-ipblock spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - ipBlock: cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 # This will still block pod and node IPs.`

However, when this

`NetworkPolicy`

is applied, Cilium blocks egress to pod and node IPs even though the IPs are within the`ipBlock`

CIDR.As a workaround, you can add

`namespaceSelector`

and`podSelector`

to select pods. This example selects all pods in all namespaces:`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: example-ipblock spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Egress egress: - to: - ipBlock: cidr: 0.0.0.0/0 - namespaceSelector: {} - podSelector: {}`

It isn't currently possible to specify a

`NetworkPolicy`

with an`ipBlock`

to allow traffic to node IPs.**Does AKS configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium**`daemonset`

?No, AKS doesn't configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium

`daemonset`

because Cilium is a critical system component for pod networking and network policy enforcement.**Does Azure CNI powered by Cilium use kube-proxy?**No, AKS clusters created with network data plane as Cilium don't use

`kube-proxy`

. If the AKS clusters are on[Azure CNI Overlay](azure-cni-overlay)or[Azure CNI with dynamic IP allocation](configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation)and are upgraded to AKS clusters running Azure CNI powered by Cilium, new nodes workloads are created without`kube-proxy`

. Older workloads are also migrated to run without`kube-proxy`

as a part of this upgrade process.

## Dual-stack networking with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

You can deploy your dual-stack AKS clusters with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium. This feature also allows you to control your IPv6 traffic with the Cilium Network Policy engine.

You must have Kubernetes version 1.29 or greater.

### Set up Overlay clusters with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

Create a cluster with Azure CNI Overlay using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command. Make sure to use the argument

`--network-dataplane cilium`

to specify the Cilium data plane.```
clusterName="myOverlayCluster"
resourceGroup="myResourceGroup"
location="westcentralus"
az aks create \
--name $clusterName \
--resource-group $resourceGroup \
--location $location \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--network-dataplane cilium \
--ip-families ipv4,ipv6 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes how to configure SSH access (preview) on your AKS clusters or node pools, during initial deployment or at a later time.

AKS supports the following configuration options to manage SSH access on cluster nodes:

**Disabled SSH**: Completely disable SSH access to cluster nodes for enhanced security**Entra ID based SSH**: Use Microsoft Entra ID credentials for SSH authentication. Benefits of using Entra ID based SSH:**Centralized identity management**: Use your existing Entra ID identities to access cluster nodes**No SSH key management**: Eliminates the need to generate, distribute, and rotate SSH keys**Enhanced security**: Leverage Entra ID security features like Conditional Access and MFA**Audit and compliance**: Centralized logging of access events through Entra ID logs**Just-in-time access**: Combine with Azure RBAC for granular access control

**Local User SSH**: Traditional SSH key-based authentication for node access

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables for your resource group, cluster name, and location:

```
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group-name>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<your-cluster-name>"
export LOCATION="<your-azure-region>"
```


## Limitations

- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not yet available for Windows node pool.
- Entra ID SSH to nodes is not supported for AKS automatic because of
[node resource group lockdown](node-resource-group-lockdown)preventing role assignments.

## Configure SSH access

To improve security and support your corporate security requirements or strategy, AKS supports disabling SSH both on the cluster and at the node pool level. Disable SSH introduces a simplified approach compared to configuring [network security group rules](concepts-security#azure-network-security-groups) on the AKS subnet/node network interface card (NIC). Disable SSH only supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools.

When you disable SSH at cluster creation time, it takes effect after the cluster is created. However, when you disable SSH on an existing cluster or node pool, AKS doesn't automatically disable SSH. At any time, you can choose to perform a nodepool upgrade operation. The disable/enable SSH operation takes effect after the node image update is complete.

Note

When you disable SSH at the cluster level, it applies to all existing node pools. Any node pools created after this operation will have SSH enabled by default, and you'll need to run these commands again in order to disable it.

Note

[kubectl debug node](node-access) continues to work after you disable SSH because it doesn't depend on the SSH service.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Disable SSH on a new cluster deployment

By default, the SSH service on AKS cluster nodes is open to all users and pods running on the cluster. You can prevent direct SSH access from any network to cluster nodes to help limit the attack vector if a container in a pod becomes compromised.

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to create a new cluster, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on all the node pools during cluster creation.Important

After you disable the SSH service, you can't SSH into the cluster to perform administrative tasks or to troubleshoot.

Note

On a newly created cluster, disable SSH will only configure the first system node pool. All other node pools need to be configured at the node pool level.

```
az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command to add a node pool, and include the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


### Disable SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access disabled`

argument to disable SSH (preview) on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access disabled
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated. The following example resembles the output and the results related to disabling SSH:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "Disabled"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To disable SSH on an existing cluster, you need to disable SSH for each node pool on this cluster.

### Re-enable SSH access

To re-enable SSH access on a node pool, update the node pool with either `--ssh-access localuser`

(for traditional SSH key-based access) or `--ssh-access entraid`

(for Entra ID based access). See the respective sections for detailed instructions.

You can configure your AKS cluster to use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for SSH authentication to cluster nodes. This eliminates the need to manage SSH keys and allows you to use your Entra ID credentials to access nodes securely.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH on a new cluster

Use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH authentication during cluster creation.```
az aks create \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully created with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


### Enable Entra ID based SSH for an existing node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access entraid`

argument to enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access entraid
```


After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information indicating *mynodepool* was successfully updated with Entra ID based SSH. The following example resembles the output:

```
"securityProfile": {
"sshAccess": "EntraID"
},
```


For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


Important

To enable Entra ID based SSH on an existing cluster, you need to enable it for each node pool individually.

Local user SSH access uses traditional SSH key-based authentication. This is the default SSH access method for AKS clusters.

### Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the [ az group create](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command.

```
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```


### Create an AKS cluster with SSH keys

Use the [az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command to deploy an AKS cluster with an SSH public key. You can either specify the key or a key file using the `--ssh-key-value`

argument, or use `--ssh-access localuser`

to explicitly set local user SSH access.

| SSH parameter | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`--generate-ssh-key` |
If you don't have your own SSH keys, specify `--generate-ssh-key` . The Azure CLI automatically generates a set of SSH keys and saves them in the default directory `~/.ssh/` . |
|
`--ssh-key-value` |
Public key path or key contents to install on node VMs for SSH access. For example, `ssh-rsa AAAAB...snip...UcyupgH azureuser@linuxvm` . |
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` |
`--ssh-access localuser` |
Explicitly enable local user SSH access with key-based authentication. | |
`--no-ssh-key` |
If you don't require SSH keys, specify this argument. However, AKS automatically generates a set of SSH keys because the Azure Virtual Machine resource dependency doesn't support an empty SSH keys file. As a result, the keys aren't returned and can't be used to SSH into the node VMs. The private key is discarded and not saved. |

Note

If no parameters are specified, the Azure CLI defaults to referencing the SSH keys stored in the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

file. If the keys aren't found, the command returns the message `An RSA key file or key value must be supplied to SSH Key Value`

.

**Examples:**

To create a cluster and use the default generated SSH keys:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --generate-ssh-key`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

To explicitly enable local user SSH access:

`az aks create --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-access localuser --generate-ssh-key`


### Enable local user SSH for a new node pool

Use the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH during node pool creation.```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


### Enable local user SSH for an existing node pool

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Use the [ az aks nodepool update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-update) command with the

`--ssh-access localuser`

argument to enable local user SSH on an existing node pool.```
az aks nodepool update \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--ssh-access localuser
```


Important

For the change to take effect, you need to reimage the node pool by using the [ az aks nodepool upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-upgrade) command.

```
az aks nodepool upgrade \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name mynodepool \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--node-image-only
```


### Update SSH public key on an existing AKS cluster

Use the [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command to update the SSH public key (preview) on your cluster. This operation updates the key on all node pools. You can either specify a key or a key file using the

`--ssh-key-value`

argument.Note

Updating the SSH keys is supported on Azure virtual machine scale sets with AKS clusters.

**Examples:**

To specify a new SSH public key value:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza-xxx'`

To specify an SSH public key file:

`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`


Important

After you update the SSH key, AKS doesn't automatically update your node pool. At any time, you can choose to perform a [nodepool upgrade operation](node-image-upgrade). The update SSH keys operation takes effect after a node image update is complete. For clusters with [Node Auto-provisioning](node-autoprovision) enabled, a node image update can be performed by applying a new label to the Kubernetes NodePool custom resource.

## Verify SSH service status

After disabling SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is inactive on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is disabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:36:53 UTC; 25min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: inactive (dead)`

, which confirms SSH is disabled on the node.

After enabling Entra ID based SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active and configured for Entra ID authentication on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

After configuring local user SSH, you can verify that the SSH service is active on your cluster nodes.

Use the Virtual Machine Scale Set [ az vmss run-command invoke](/en-us/cli/azure/vmss/run-command#az-vmss-run-command-invoke) command to check SSH service status.

```
az vmss run-command invoke --resource-group <node-resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --command-id RunShellScript --instance-id 0 --scripts "systemctl status ssh"
```


The following sample output shows the expected result when SSH is enabled:

```
{
"value": [
{
"code": "ProvisioningState/succeeded",
"displayStatus": "Provisioning succeeded",
"level": "Info",
"message": "Enable succeeded: \n[stdout]\n● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-01-03 15:40:20 UTC; 19min ago\n..."
}
]
}
```


Search for the word **Active** and verify that its value is `Active: active (running)`

, which confirms SSH is enabled on the node.

# Update the key vault mode for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption (legacy)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to update the key vault mode from public to private or private to public for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption.

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with KMS etcd encryption enabled. For more information, see
[Add Key Management Service (KMS) etcd encryption to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-kms-etcd-encryption). - Azure CLI version 2.39.0 or later. Find your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update a key vault mode

Note

To change a different key vault with a different mode (whether public or private), you can run [ az aks update](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) directly. To change the mode of an attached key vault, you must first turn off KMS, then turn it on again using the new key vault IDs.

Turn off KMS on the existing cluster and release the key vault using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

parameter.`az aks update --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --disable-azure-keyvault-kms`

Warning

After you turn off KMS, the encryption key vault key is still needed. You can't delete or expire it.

Update all secrets using the

`kubectl get secrets`

command to ensure the secrets created earlier are no longer encrypted. For larger clusters, you might want to subdivide the secrets by namespace or create an update script. If the previous command to update KMS fails, still run the following command to avoid unexpected state for KMS plugin.`kubectl get secrets --all-namespaces -o json | kubectl replace -f -`

When you run the command, the following error is safe to ignore:

`The object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again.`

Update the key vault from public to private using the

command with the`az keyvault update`

`--public-network-access`

parameter set to`Disabled`

.`az keyvault update --name $KEY_VAULT --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --public-network-access Disabled`

Turn on KMS with the updated private key vault using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access`

parameter set to`Private`

.`az aks update \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --enable-azure-keyvault-kms \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-id $KEY_ID \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-network-access "Private" \ --azure-keyvault-kms-key-vault-resource-id $KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`

# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node auto-repair

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) continuously monitors the health state of worker nodes and performs automatic node repair if they become unhealthy. The Azure virtual machine (VM) platform [performs maintenance on VMs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates) experiencing issues. AKS and Azure VMs work together to minimize service disruptions for clusters.

In this article, you learn how the automatic node repair functionality behaves for Windows and Linux nodes.

## How AKS checks for NotReady nodes

AKS uses the following rules to determine if a node is unhealthy and needs repair:

- The node reports the
status on consecutive checks within a 10-minute time frame.**NotReady** - The node doesn't report any status within 10 minutes.

You can manually check the health state of your nodes with the `kubectl get nodes`

command.

## How automatic repair works

Note

AKS initiates repair operations with the user account **aks-remediator**.

If AKS identifies an unhealthy node that remains unhealthy for at least *five* minutes, AKS performs the following actions:

- AKS reboots the node.
- If the node remains unhealthy after reboot, AKS reimages the node.
- If the node remains unhealthy after reimage and it's a Linux node, AKS redeploys the node.

AKS retries the restart, reimage, and redeploy sequence up to three times if the node remains unhealthy. The overall auto repair process can take up to an hour to complete.

## Limitations

AKS node auto-repair is a best effort service and we don't guarantee that the node is restored back to healthy status. If your node persists in an unhealthy state, we highly encourage that you perform manual investigation of the node. Learn more about [troubleshooting node NotReady status](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/node-not-ready-basic-troubleshooting).

There are cases where AKS doesn't perform automatic repair. Failure to automatically repair the node can occur either by design or if Azure can't detect that an issue exists. Examples of when auto-repair isn't performed include:

- A node status isn't being reported due to error in network configuration.
- A node failed to initially register as a healthy node.
- If either of the following taints are present on the node:
`node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/shutdown`

,`ToBeDeletedByClusterAutoscaler`

. - A node is in the process of being upgraded, resulting in the following annotation on the node
`"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/scale-down-disabled": "true"`

and`"kubernetes.azure.com/azure-cluster-autoscaler-scale-down-disabled-reason": "upgrade"`


## Monitor node auto-repair using Kubernetes events

When AKS performs node auto-repair on your cluster, AKS emits Kubernetes events from the aks-auto-repair source for visibility. The following events appear on a node object when auto-repair happens.

To learn more about accessing, storing, and configuring alerts on Kubernetes events, see [Use Kubernetes events for troubleshooting in Azure Kubernetes Service](events).

| Reason | Event Message | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NodeRebootStart | Node auto-repair is initiating a reboot action due to NotReady status persisting for more than 5 minutes. | This event is emitted to notify you when reboot is about to be performed on your node. This action is the first in the overall node auto-repair sequence. |
| NodeRebootEnd | Reboot action from node auto-repair is completed. | Emitted once reboot is complete on the node. This event doesn't indicate the health status (healthy or unhealthy) of the node after the reboot is performed. |
| NodeReimageStart | Node auto-repair is initiating a reimage action due to NotReady status persisting for more than 5 minutes. | This event is emitted to notify you when reimage is about to be performed on your node. |
| NodeReimageEnd | Reimage action from node auto-repair is completed. | Emitted once reimage is complete on the node. This event doesn't indicate the health status (healthy or unhealthy) of the node after the reimage is performed. |
| NodeRedeployStart | Node auto-repair is initiating a redeploy action due to NotReady status persisting more than 5 minutes. | This event is emitted to notify you when redeploy is about to be performed on your node. Redeploy is the last action in the node auto-repair sequence. |
| NodeRedeployEnd | Redeploy action from node auto-repair is completed. | Emitted once redeploy is complete on the node. This event doesn't indicate the health status (healthy or unhealthy) of the node after redeploy is performed. |

If any errors occur during the node auto-repair process, the following events are emitted with the verbatim error message. Learn more about [troubleshooting common node auto-repair errors](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/availability-performance/node-auto-repair-errors).

Note

*Error code* in the following event messages varies depending on the error reported.

| Reason | Event Message | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NodeRebootError | Node auto-repair reboot action failed due to an operation failure. See error details here: Error code |
Emitted when there's an error with the reboot action. |
| NodeReimageError | Node auto-repair reimage action failed due to an operation failure. See error details here: Error code |
Emitted when there's an error with the reimage action. |
| NodeRedeployError | Node auto-repair redeploy action failed due to an operation failure. See error details here: Error code |
Emitted when there's an error with the redeploy action. |

## Next steps

By default, you can access Kubernetes events and logs on your AKS cluster from the past 1 hour. To store and query events and logs from the past 90 days, enable [Container Insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview#access-container-insights) for deeper troubleshooting on your AKS cluster.

# Overview of managed namespaces in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

**Applies to:** ✔️ AKS Automatic ✔️ AKS Standard

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. With logical isolation, you can use a single AKS cluster for multiple workloads, teams, or environments. Kubernetes namespaces form the logical isolation boundary for workloads and resources. Performing logical isolation involves implementing scripts and processes to create namespaces, set resource limits, apply network policies, and grant team access via role-based access control. Learn how to use managed namespaces in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to simplify namespace management, cluster multi-tenancy, and resource isolation.

Logical separation of clusters usually provides a higher pod density than physically isolated clusters, with less excess compute capacity sitting idle in the cluster. When combined with [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler) or [Node Auto Provisioning](node-autoprovision), you can scale the number of nodes up or down to meet demands. This best practice approach minimizes costs by running only the required number of nodes.

## Network policies

[Network Policies](use-network-policies) are Kubernetes resources you can use to control the flow of traffic between pods, namespaces, and external endpoints. Network policies allow you to define rules for ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic, ensuring that only authorized communication is permitted. By applying network policies, you can enhance the security and isolation of workloads within your cluster.

Note

The default ingress network policy rule of **Allow same namespace** opts for a secure by default stance. If you need your Kubernetes Services, ingresses, or gateways to be accessible from outside of the namespace where they're deployed, for example from an ingress controller deployed in a separate namespace, you need to select **Allow all**. You might then apply your own network policy to restrict ingress to be from that namespace only.

Managed namespaces come with a set of built-in policies.

**Allow all**: Allows all network traffic.**Allow same namespace**: Allows all network traffic within the same namespace.**Deny all**: Denies all network traffic.

You can apply any of the built-in policies on both **ingress** and **egress** rules and they have the following default values.

| Policy | Default value |
|---|---|
| Ingress | Allow same namespace |
| Egress | Allow all |

Note

Users with a `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/networking.k8s.io/networkpolicies/write`

action, such as `Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer`

, on the Microsoft Entra ID role they're assigned can add more network policies through the Kubernetes API.

For example, if an admin applies a `Deny All`

policy for ingress/egress, and a user applies an `Allow`

policy for a namespace via the Kubernetes API, the `Allow`

policy takes priority over the `Deny All`

policy, and traffic is allowed to flow for the namespace.

## Resource quotas

[Resource Quotas](operator-best-practices-scheduler#enforce-resource-quotas) are Kubernetes resources that are used to manage and limit the resource consumption of namespaces within a cluster. They allow administrators to define constraints on the amount of CPU, memory, storage, or other resources that are used by workloads in a namespace. By applying resource quotas, you can ensure fair resource distribution, prevent resource overuse, and maintain cluster stability.

Managed namespaces can be created with the following resource quotas:

**CPU requests and limits**: Define the minimum and maximum amount of CPU resources that workloads in the namespace can request or consume. The quota ensures that workloads have sufficient CPU resources to operate while preventing overuse that could affect other namespaces. The quota is defined in the[milliCPU form](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu).**Memory requests and limits**: Specify the minimum and maximum amount of memory resources that workloads in the namespace can request or consume. The quota helps maintain stability by avoiding memory overcommitment and ensuring fair resource allocation across namespaces. The quota is defined in[power-of-two equivalents form](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)such as`Ei`

,`Pi`

,`Ti`

,`Gi`

,`Mi`

,`Ki`

.

## Labels and annotations

Kubernetes [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) and [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) are metadata attached to Kubernetes objects, such as namespaces, to provide additional information. Labels are key-value pairs used to organize and select resources, enabling efficient grouping and querying. Annotations store nonidentifying metadata, such as configuration details or operational instructions, that are consumed by tools or systems.

You can optionally set Kubernetes Labels and Annotations to be applied on the namespace.

## Adoption policy

The adoption policy determines how an existing namespace in Kubernetes is handled when creating a managed namespace.

Warning

Onboarding an existing namespace to be managed can cause disruption. If the **resource quota** applied is less than what is already being requested by pods, new deployments and pods that exceed the quota is denied. Existing deployments aren't affected, but scaling is denied. Applying **network policies** to an existing namespace can affect existing traffic. Ensure that the policies are tested and validated to avoid unintended disruptions to communication between pods or external endpoints.

The following options are available:

**Never**: If the namespace already exists in the cluster, attempts to create that namespace as a managed namespace fails.**IfIdentical**: Take over the existing namespace to be managed, provided there are no differences between the existing namespace and the desired configuration.**Always**: Always take over the existing namespace to be managed, even if some fields in the namespace might be overwritten.

## Delete policy

The delete policy specifies how the Kubernetes namespace is handled when the managed namespace resource is deleted.

Warning

Deleting a managed namespace with the **Delete** policy causes all resources within that namespace, such as Deployments, Services, Ingresses, and other Kubernetes objects, to be deleted. Ensure that you back up or migrate any critical resources before proceeding.

The following options are available:

**Keep**: Only delete the managed namespace resource while keeping the Kubernetes namespace intact. Additionally, the`ManagedByARM`

label is removed from the namespace.**Delete**: Delete both the managed namespace resource and the Kubernetes namespace together.

## Managed namespaces built-in roles

Managed namespaces uses the following built-in roles for the control plane.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Kubernetes Service Namespace User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-namespace-user)Managed namespaces uses the following built-in roles for the data plane.

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
|

[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-writer)[Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/containers#azure-kubernetes-service-rbac-admin)## Managed namespaces use cases

Properly setting up [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) with associated [quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/quota-memory-cpu-namespace/) or [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#networkpolicy-resource) can be complex and time-consuming. Managed namespaces allow you to set up preconfigured namespaces in your AKS clusters that you can interact with using the Azure CLI.

The following sections outline some common use cases for managed namespaces.

### Manage teams and resources on AKS

Let's say you're an admin at a small startup. You have an AKS cluster provisioned and want to set up namespaces for developers from your *finance*, *legal*, and *design* teams. As you're setting up your company's environment, you want to make sure that access is tightly controlled, resources are rightly scoped, and environments are organized properly.

The

*finance*team intakes forms and files from teams all across the company, but they hold sensitive information that ideally shouldn't leave their environment. Their applications and workflows are lighter on the computing side but consume a lot of memory. As a result, you decide to set up a namespace that allows for all network ingress, network egress only within their namespace, and scope their resources accordingly. A label to the namespace helps easily identify which team is using it.`az aks namespace add \ --name $FINANCE_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 250m \ --cpu-limit 500m \ --memory-request 512Mi \ --memory-limit 2Gi \ --ingress-policy AllowAll \ --egress-policy AllowSameNamespace \ --labels team=finance`

The

*legal*team deals primarily with sensitive data. Their applications use a fair amount of memory but require little compute resources. You decide to set up a namespace that's extremely restrictive for both the ingress/egress policies, and scope their resource quotas accordingly.`az aks namespace add \ --name $LEGAL_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 250m \ --cpu-limit 500m \ --memory-request 2Gi \ --memory-limit 5Gi \ --ingress-policy DenyAll \ --egress-policy DenyAll \ --labels team=legal`

The

*design*team needs the ability to freely flow data to showcase their work across the company. They also encourage teams to send them content for reference. Their applications are intensive and require a large chunk of memory and CPU. You decide to set them up with a minimally restrictive namespace and allocate a sizeable amount of resources for them.`az aks namespace add \ --name $DESIGN_NAMESPACE \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cpu-request 2000m \ --cpu-limit 2500m \ --memory-request 5Gi \ --memory-limit 8Gi \ --ingress-policy AllowAll \ --egress-policy AllowAll \ --labels team=design`


With these namespaces set up, you now have environments for the three teams in your organization that should allow each team to get up and running in an environment that best suits their needs. Admins can use [Azure CLI calls](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/namespace) to update the namespaces as needs shift.

### View managed namespaces

As the number of teams you deal with expands, or as your organization grows, you might find yourself needing to review the namespaces you set up.

Let's say you want to review the namespaces in your cluster from the [previous section](#manage-teams-and-resources-on-aks) to ensure there are three namespaces.

Use the [ az aks namespace list](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/namespace#az-aks-namespace-list) command to review your namespaces.

```
az aks namespace list \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--output table
```


Your output should look similar to the following example output:

```
Name ResourceGroup Location
------------------ --------------- ----------
$CLUSTER_NAME/$DESIGN_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
$CLUSTER_NAME/$LEGAL_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
$CLUSTER_NAME/$FINANCE_NAMESPACE $RESOURCE_GROUP <LOCATION>
```


### Control access to managed namespaces

You can further use [Azure RBAC roles](#managed-namespaces-built-in-roles), scoped to each namespace, to determine which users have access to certain actions within the namespace. With the proper configuration, you can ensure users have all the access they need within the namespace, while limiting their access to other namespaces or cluster-wide resources.

# Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Workloads deployed on an AKS cluster require Microsoft Entra application credentials or managed identities to access Microsoft Entra protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault and Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Entra Workload ID integrates with the capabilities native to Kubernetes to federate with external identity providers, allowing you to assign workload identities to your workloads to authenticate and access other services and resources.

[Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identities-overview) uses [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#serviceaccount-token-volume-projection) (or a *service account*), to enable pods to use a Kubernetes identity. A Kubernetes token is issued and [OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure resources securely with Microsoft Entra ID, based on annotated service accounts.

You can use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with [Azure Identity client libraries](#azure-identity-client-libraries) or the [Microsoft Authentication Library](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) (MSAL) collection, together with [application registration](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/application-model#register-an-application), to seamlessly authenticate and access Azure cloud resources.

Note

You can use *Service Connector* to help you configure some steps automatically. For more information, see [What is Service Connector?](/en-us/azure/service-connector/overview)

## Prerequisites

- AKS supports Microsoft Entra Workload ID on version 1.22 and higher.
- The Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version, and run`az upgrade`

to upgrade the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

- You can have a maximum of
[20 federated identity credentials](/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-considerations#general-federated-identity-credential-considerations)per managed identity. - It takes a few seconds for the federated identity credential to propagate after being initially added.
- The
[virtual nodes](virtual-nodes)add-on, based on the open source project[Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/docs/), isn't supported. - Creation of federated identity credentials isn't supported on user-assigned managed identities in
[these regions](/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-considerations#unsupported-regions-user-assigned-managed-identities).

## Azure Identity client libraries

In the Azure Identity client libraries, choose one of the following approaches:

- Use
`DefaultAzureCredential`

, which attempts to use the`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

. - Create a
`ChainedTokenCredential`

instance that includes`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

. - Use
`WorkloadIdentityCredential`

directly.

The following table provides the **minimum** package version required for each language ecosystem's client library:

| Ecosystem | Library | Minimum version |
|---|---|---|
| .NET |
|

[azure-identity-cpp](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/blob/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md)[azidentity](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity)[azure-identity](/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)[@azure/identity](/en-us/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)[azure-identity](/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)## Azure Identity client library code samples

The following code samples use the `DefaultAzureCredential`

. This credential type uses the environment variables injected by the workload identity mutating [webhook](#webhook-certificate-auto-rotation) to authenticate with Azure Key Vault. To see samples using one of the other approaches, refer to the [ecosystem-specific client libraries](#azure-identity-client-libraries).

```
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets;
string keyVaultUrl = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("<key-vault-url>");
string secretName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("<secret-name>");
var client = new SecretClient(
new Uri(keyVaultUrl),
new DefaultAzureCredential());
KeyVaultSecret secret = await client.GetSecretAsync(secretName);
```


## Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)

The following client libraries are the **minimum** version required:

| Ecosystem | Library | Image | Example | Has Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| .NET |
|

`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-net:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-net/akvdotnet)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-go](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-go:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-go)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-java:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-java)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-js](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-node:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-node)[Microsoft Authentication Library-for-python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python)`ghcr.io/azure/azure-workload-identity/msal-python:latest`

[Link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/tree/main/examples/msal-python)## How it works

In this security model, the AKS cluster acts as the token issuer. Microsoft Entra ID uses OIDC to discover public signing keys and verify the authenticity of the service account token before exchanging it for a Microsoft Entra token. Your workload can exchange a service account token projected to its volume for a Microsoft Entra token using the Azure Identity client library or the MSAL.

The following table describes the required OIDC issuer endpoints for Microsoft Entra Workload ID:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
`{IssuerURL}/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
Also known as the OIDC discovery document. This contains the metadata about the issuer's configurations. |
`{IssuerURL}/openid/v1/jwks` |
This contains the public signing key(s) that Microsoft Entra ID uses to verify the authenticity of the service account token. |

The following diagram summarizes the authentication sequence using OIDC:

### Webhook certificate auto-rotation

Similar to other webhook add-ons, the [cluster certificate auto-rotation](certificate-rotation#certificate-autorotation) operation rotates the certificate.

## Service account labels and annotations

Microsoft Entra Workload ID supports the following mappings related to a service account:

**One-to-one**, where a service account references a Microsoft Entra object.**Many-to-one**, where multiple service accounts reference the same Microsoft Entra object.**One-to-many**, where a service account references multiple Microsoft Entra objects by changing the client ID annotation. For more information, see[How to federate multiple identities with a Kubernetes service account](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/faq.html#how-to-federate-multiple-identities-with-a-kubernetes-service-account).

Note

If you update the service account annotations, you must restart the pod for the changes to take effect.

If you've used [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity), think of a service account as an Azure security principal, except that a service account is part of the core Kubernetes API, rather than a [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) (CRD). The following sections describe a list of available labels and annotations that you can use to configure the behavior when exchanging the service account token for a Microsoft Entra access token.

### Service account annotations

All annotations are optional. If the annotation isn't specified, the default value is used.

| Annotation | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/client-id` |
Represents the Microsoft Entra application client ID to be used with the pod. |
|
`azure.workload.identity/tenant-id` |
Represents the Azure tenant ID where the Microsoft Entra application is registered. |
AZURE_TENANT_ID environment variable extracted from `azure-wi-webhook-config` ConfigMap. |
`azure.workload.identity/service-account-token-expiration` |
Represents the `expirationSeconds` field for the projected service account token. It's an optional field that you configure to prevent any downtime caused by errors during service account token refresh. Kubernetes service account token expiry isn't correlated with Microsoft Entra tokens. Microsoft Entra tokens expire in 24 hours after they're issued. |
3600 Supported range is 3600-86400. |

### Pod labels

Note

For applications using Microsoft Entra Workload ID, it's required to add the label `azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`

to the pod spec for AKS to move the workload identity to a *Fail Close* scenario to provide a consistent and reliable behavior for pods that need to use workload identity. Otherwise, the pods fail after they're restarted.

| Label | Description | Recommended value | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/use` |
This label is required in the pod template spec. Only pods with this label are mutated by the azure-workload-identity mutating admission webhook to inject the Azure specific environment variables and the projected service account token volume. | true | Yes |

### Pod annotations

All annotations are optional. If the annotation isn't specified, the default value is used.

| Annotation | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
`azure.workload.identity/service-account-token-expiration` |
See
Pod annotations take precedence over service account annotations. |

Supported range is 3600-86400.

`azure.workload.identity/skip-containers`

`container1;container2`

.`azure.workload.identity/use: true`

.`azure.workload.identity/inject-proxy-sidecar`

`azure.workload.identity/proxy-sidecar-port`

## Migrate to Microsoft Entra Workload ID

You can configure clusters already running a pod-managed identity to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID using one of two ways:

- Use the same configuration you implemented for pod-managed identity. You can annotate the service account within the namespace with the identity to enable Microsoft Entra Workload ID and inject the annotations into the pods.
- Rewrite your application to use the latest version of the Azure Identity client library.

To help streamline and ease the migration process, we developed a migration sidecar that converts the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) transactions your application makes over to [OIDC](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc). The migration sidecar isn't intended to be a long-term solution, but a way to get up and running quickly on Microsoft Entra Workload ID. Running the migration sidecar within your application proxies the application IMDS transactions over to OIDC. The alternative approach is to upgrade to a supported version of the [Azure Identity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries) client library, which supports OIDC authentication.

The following table summarizes our migration or deployment recommendations for your AKS cluster:

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| New or existing cluster deployment
|

# Upgrade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node images

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) regularly provides new node images, so it's beneficial to upgrade your node images frequently to use the latest AKS features. Linux node images are updated weekly, and Windows node images are updated monthly. Image upgrade announcements are included in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases), and it can take up to a week for these updates to be rolled out across all regions. You can also perform node image upgrades automatically and schedule them using planned maintenance. For more information, see [Automatically upgrade node images](auto-upgrade-node-image).

This article shows you how to upgrade AKS cluster node images and how to update node pool images without upgrading the Kubernetes version. For information on upgrading the Kubernetes version for your cluster, see [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster).

Note

The AKS cluster must use virtual machine scale sets for the nodes.

It's not possible to downgrade a node image version (for example *AKSUbuntu-2204 to AKSUbuntu-1804*, or *AKSUbuntu-2204-202308.01.0 to AKSUbuntu-2204-202307.27.0*).

## Connect to your AKS cluster

Connect to your AKS cluster using the [

`az aks get-credentials`

][az-aks-get-credentials] command.`az aks get-credentials \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER`


## Check for available node image upgrades

Check for available node image upgrades using the

command.`az aks nodepool get-upgrades`

`az aks nodepool get-upgrades \ --nodepool-name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP`

In the output, find and make note of the

`latestNodeImageVersion`

value. This value is the latest node image version available for your node pool.Check your current node image version to compare with the latest version using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --query nodeImageVersion`

If the

`nodeImageVersion`

value is different from the`latestNodeImageVersion`

, you can upgrade your node image.

## Upgrade all node images in all node pools

Upgrade all node images in all node pools in your cluster using the

command with the`az aks upgrade`

`--node-image-only`

flag.`az aks upgrade \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --node-image-only \ --yes`

You can check the status of the node images using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.Note

This command might differ slightly depending on the shell you use. For more information on Windows and PowerShell environments, see the

[Kubernetes JSONPath documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/).`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

When the upgrade completes, use the

command to get the updated node pool details. The current node image is shown in the`az aks show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $AKS_CLUSTER`


## Upgrade a specific node pool

Update the OS image of a node pool without doing a Kubernetes cluster upgrade using the

command with the`az aks nodepool upgrade`

`--node-image-only`

flag.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --node-image-only`

You can check the status of the node images with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.Note

This command may differ slightly depending on the shell you use. For more information on Windows and PowerShell environments, see the

[Kubernetes JSONPath documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/).`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

When the upgrade completes, use the

command to get the updated node pool details. The current node image is shown in the`az aks nodepool show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL`


## Upgrade node images with node surge

To speed up the node image upgrade process, you can upgrade your node images using a customizable node surge value. By default, AKS uses one extra node to configure upgrades.

Upgrade node images with node surge using the

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--max-surge`

flag to configure the number of nodes used for upgrades.Note

To learn more about the trade-offs of various

`--max-surge`

settings, see[Customize node surge upgrade](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade).`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL \ --max-surge 33% \ --no-wait`

You can check the status of the node images with the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.labels.kubernetes\.azure\.com\/node-image-version}{"\n"}{end}'`

Get the updated node pool details using the

command. The current node image is shown in the`az aks nodepool show`

`nodeImageVersion`

property.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \ --name $AKS_NODEPOOL`

# Stop and start an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You may not need to continuously run your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads. For example, you may have a development cluster that you only use during business hours. This means there are times where your cluster might be idle, running nothing more than the system components. You can reduce the cluster footprint by [scaling all User node pools to 0](scale-cluster#scale-user-node-pools-to-0), but your

[is still required to run the system components while the cluster is running.](use-system-pools)

`System`

poolTo better optimize your costs during these periods, you can turn off, or stop, your cluster. This action stops your control plane and agent nodes, allowing you to save on all the compute costs, while maintaining all objects except standalone pods. The cluster state is stored for when you start it again, allowing you to pick up where you left off.

Caution

Stopping your cluster deallocates the control plane and releases the capacity. In regions experiencing capacity constraints, customers may be unable to start a stopped cluster. We do not recommend stopping mission critical workloads for this reason.

Note

AKS start operations will restore all objects from ETCD with the exception of standalone pods with the same names and ages. meaning that a pod's age will continue to be calculated from its original creation time. This count will keep increasing over time, regardless of whether the cluster is in a stopped state.

## Before you begin

This article assumes you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using [Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli), [Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the [Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

### About the cluster stop/start feature

When using the cluster stop/start feature, the following conditions apply:

- This feature is only supported for Virtual Machine Scale Set backed clusters.
- You can't stop clusters which use the
[Node Autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision)feature. - The cluster state of a stopped AKS cluster is preserved for up to 12 months. If your cluster is stopped for more than 12 months, you can't recover the state. For more information, see the
[AKS support policies](support-policies). - You can only perform start or delete operations on a stopped AKS cluster. To perform other operations, like scaling or upgrading, you need to start your cluster first.
- If you provisioned PrivateEndpoints linked to private clusters, they need to be deleted and recreated again when starting a stopped AKS cluster.
- Because the stop process drains all nodes, any standalone pods (i.e. pods not managed by a Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, etc.) will be deleted.
- When you start your cluster back up, the following behavior is expected:
- The IP address of your API server may change.
- If you're using cluster autoscaler, when you start your cluster, your current node count may not be between the min and max range values you set. The cluster starts with the number of nodes it needs to run its workloads, which isn't impacted by your autoscaler settings. When your cluster performs scaling operations, the min and max values will impact your current node count, and your cluster will eventually enter and remain in that desired range until you stop your cluster.


## Stop an AKS cluster

Use the

command to stop a running AKS cluster, including the nodes and control plane. The following example stops a cluster named`az aks stop`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks stop --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has stopped using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows as`Stopped`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Stopped" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Stopping`

, your cluster hasn't fully stopped yet.

Important

If you're using [pod disruption budgets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/), the stop operation can take longer, as the drain process will take more time to complete.

## Start an AKS cluster

Caution

After utilizing the start/stop feature on AKS, it is essential to wait 15-30 minutes before restarting your AKS cluster. This waiting period is necessary because it takes several minutes for the relevant services to fully stop. Attempting to restart your cluster during this process can disrupt the shutdown process and potentially cause issues with the cluster or its workloads.

Use the

command to start a stopped AKS cluster. The cluster restarts with the previous control plane state and number of agent nodes. The following example starts a cluster named`az aks start`

*myAKSCluster*:`az aks start --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Verify your cluster has started using the

command and confirming the`az aks show`

`powerState`

shows`Running`

.`az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup`

Your output should look similar to the following condensed example output:

`{ [...] "nodeResourceGroup": "MC_myResourceGroup_myAKSCluster_westus2", "powerState":{ "code":"Running" }, "privateFqdn": null, "provisioningState": "Succeeded", "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup", [...] }`

If the

`provisioningState`

shows`Starting`

, your cluster hasn't fully started yet.
