# Support policies for Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article describes technical support policies and limitations for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It also details agent node management, managed control plane components, third-party open-source components, and security or patch management.

## Service updates and releases

- For release information, see
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - For information on preview features, see the
[AKS roadmap](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/projects/1).

## Managed features in AKS

Base infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud components, such as compute or networking components, allow you access to low-level controls and customization options. By contrast, AKS provides a turnkey Kubernetes deployment that gives you a common set of configurations and capabilities you need for your cluster. As an AKS user, you have limited customization and deployment options. In exchange, you don't need to worry about or manage Kubernetes clusters directly.

With AKS, you get a fully managed *control plane*. The control plane contains all of the components and services you need to operate and deliver Kubernetes clusters to end users. Microsoft maintains and operates all Kubernetes components.

Microsoft manages and monitors the following components through the control plane:

- Kubelet or Kubernetes API servers
- Etcd or a compatible key-value store, providing Quality of Service (QoS), scalability, and runtime
- DNS services (for example, kube-dns or CoreDNS)
- Kubernetes proxy or networking, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is used - Any other
[add-ons](integrations#add-ons)or system component running in the kube-system namespace.

AKS isn't a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution. Some components, such as agent nodes, have *shared responsibility*, where you must help maintain the AKS cluster. User input is required, for example, to apply an agent node operating system (OS) security patch.

The services are *managed* in the sense that Microsoft and the AKS team deploys, operates, and is responsible for service availability and functionality. Customers can't alter these managed components. Microsoft limits customization to ensure a consistent and scalable user experience.

## Shared responsibility

When a cluster is created, you define the Kubernetes agent nodes that AKS creates. Your workloads are executed on these nodes.

Because your agent nodes execute private code and store sensitive data, Microsoft Support can access them only in a limited way. Microsoft Support can't sign in to, execute commands in, or view logs for these nodes without your express permission or assistance.

Any modification made directly to the agent nodes using any one of the IaaS APIs renders the cluster unsupportable. Any modification applied to the agent nodes must be done using kubernetes-native mechanisms such as `Daemon Sets`

.

Similarly, while you might add any metadata to the cluster and nodes, such as tags and labels, changing any of the system created metadata renders the cluster unsupported.

## AKS support coverage

### Supported scenarios

Microsoft provides technical support for the following examples:

- Connectivity to all Kubernetes components that the Kubernetes service provides and supports, such as the API server.
- Management, uptime, QoS, and operations of Kubernetes control plane services (For example, Kubernetes control plane, API server, etcd, and coreDNS).
- Etcd data store. Support includes automated, transparent backups of all etcd data every 30 minutes for disaster planning and cluster state restoration. These backups aren't directly available to you or anyone else. They ensure data reliability and consistency. On-demand rollback or restore isn't supported as a feature.
- Any integration points in the Azure cloud provider driver for Kubernetes. These include integrations into other Azure services such as load balancers, persistent volumes, or networking (Kubernetes and Azure CNI, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is in use). - Questions or issues about customization of control plane components such as the Kubernetes API server, etcd, and coreDNS.
- Issues about networking, such as Azure CNI, kubenet, or other network access and functionality issues, except when
[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)is in use. Issues could include DNS resolution, packet loss, routing, and so on. Microsoft supports various networking scenarios:- Kubenet and Azure CNI using managed VNETs or with custom (bring your own) subnets.
- Connectivity to other Azure services and applications
- Microsoft-managed ingress controllers or load balancer configurations
- Network performance and latency
- Microsoft-managed
[network policies](use-network-policies#differences-between-network-policy-engines-cilium-azure-npm-and-calico)components and functionalities


Note

Any cluster actions taken by Microsoft/AKS are made with your consent under a built-in Kubernetes role `aks-service`

and built-in role binding `aks-service-rolebinding`

. This role enables AKS to troubleshoot and diagnose cluster issues, but can't modify permissions nor create roles or role bindings, or other high privilege actions. Role access is only enabled under active support tickets with just-in-time (JIT) access.

### Unsupported scenarios

Microsoft doesn't provide technical support for the following scenarios:

Questions about how to use Kubernetes. For example, Microsoft Support doesn't provide advice on how to create custom ingress controllers, use application workloads, or apply third-party or open-source software packages or tools.

Note

Microsoft Support can advise on AKS cluster functionality, customization, and tuning (for example, Kubernetes operations issues and procedures).

Third-party open-source projects that aren't provided as part of the Kubernetes control plane or deployed with AKS clusters. These projects might include Istio, Helm, Envoy, or others.

Note

Microsoft can provide best-effort support for third-party open-source projects such as Helm. Where the third-party open-source tool integrates with the Kubernetes Azure cloud provider or other AKS-specific bugs, Microsoft supports examples and applications from Microsoft documentation.

Third-party closed-source software. This software can include security scanning tools and networking devices or software.

Configuring or troubleshooting application-specific code or behavior of third-party applications or tools running within the AKS cluster. This includes application deployment issues not related to the AKS platform itself.

Issuance, renewal, or management of certificates for applications running on AKS.

Network customizations other than the ones listed in the

[AKS documentation](./). For example, Microsoft Support can't configure devices or virtual appliances meant to provide[outbound traffic](outbound-rules-control-egress)for the AKS cluster, such as VPNs or firewalls.Note

On a best-effort basis, Microsoft Support might advise on the

[configuration needed](outbound-rules-control-egress)for Azure Firewall, but not for other third-party devices.Custom or third-party CNI plugins used in

[BYOCNI](use-byo-cni)mode.Configuring or troubleshooting non-Microsoft-managed network policies. While using network policies is supported, Microsoft Support can't investigate issues stemming from custom network policy configurations.

Configuring or troubleshooting non-Microsoft-managed ingress controllers, such as nginx, kong, traefik, etc. This includes addressing functionality issues that arise after AKS-specific operations, like an ingress controller ceasing to work following a Kubernetes version upgrade. Such issues might stem from incompatibilities between the ingress controller version and the new Kubernetes version. For a fully supported option, consider leveraging a

[Microsoft-managed ingress controller option](concepts-network-ingress#compare-ingress-options).Configuring or troubleshooting DaemonSets (including scripts) used to customize node configurations. Although using DaemonSets is the recommended approach to tune, modify, or install third-party software on cluster agent nodes when

[configuration file parameters](custom-node-configuration)are insufficient, Microsoft Support can't troubleshoot issues arising from the custom scripts used in DaemonSets due to their custom nature.Stand-by and proactive scenarios. Microsoft Support provides reactive support to help solve active issues in a timely and professional manner. However, standby or proactive support to help you eliminate operational risks, increase availability, and optimize performance aren't covered.

[Eligible customers](https://www.microsoft.com/unifiedsupport)can contact their account team to get nominated for[Azure Event Management service](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/proactively-plan-for-your-critical-event-in-azure-with-enhanced-support-and-engineering-services/). It's a paid service delivered by Microsoft support engineers that includes a proactive solution risk assessment and coverage during the event.Vulnerabilities / CVEs with a vendor fix that is less than 30 days old. As long as you're running the updated VHD, you shouldn't be running any container image vulnerabilities / CVEs with a vendor fix that is over 30 days old. It's customer responsibility to update the VHD and provide filtered lists to Microsoft support. Once you updated your VHD, it is customer responsibility to filter the vulnerabilities / CVEs report and provide a list only with vulnerabilities/CVEs with a vendor fix that is over 30 days old. If that will be the case, Microsoft support will make sure to work internally and address components with a vendor fix released more than 30 days ago. Additionally, Microsoft provide vulnerability / CVE-related support only for Microsoft-managed components (i.e., AKS node images, managed container images for applications that get deploy during cluster creation or via the installation of a managed add-on). For more details about vulnerability management for AKS, visit

[this page](concepts-vulnerability-management).Custom code samples or scripts. While Microsoft Support

*can*provide small code samples and reviews of small code samples within a support case to demonstrate how to use features of a Microsoft product, Microsoft Support*can't*provide custom code samples that are specific to your environment or application.

## AKS support coverage for agent nodes

### Microsoft responsibilities for AKS agent nodes

Microsoft and you share responsibility for Kubernetes agent nodes where:

- The base OS image has required additions (such as monitoring and networking agents).
- The agent nodes receive OS patches automatically.
- Issues with the Kubernetes control plane components that run on the agent nodes are automatically remediated. These components include the below:
`Kube-proxy`

- Networking tunnels that provide communication paths to the Kubernetes master components
`Kubelet`

`containerd`


Note

If an agent node isn't operational, AKS might restart individual components or the entire agent node. These restart operations are automated and provide auto-remediation for common issues. If you want to know more about the auto-remediation mechanisms, see [Node Auto-Repair](node-auto-repair)

### Customer responsibilities for AKS agent nodes

Microsoft provides patches and new images for your image nodes weekly. To keep your agent node OS and runtime components up to date, you should apply these patches and updates regularly either manually or automatically. For more information, see:

Similarly, AKS regularly releases new Kubernetes patches and minor versions. These updates can contain security or functionality improvements to Kubernetes. You're responsible to keep your clusters' Kubernetes version updated and according to the [AKS Kubernetes support version policy](supported-kubernetes-versions).

#### User customization of agent nodes

Note

AKS agent nodes appear in the Azure portal as standard Azure IaaS resources. However, these virtual machines are deployed into a custom Azure resource group (prefixed with MC_*). You can't change the base OS image or make any direct customizations to these nodes using the IaaS APIs or resources. Any custom changes that aren't performed from the AKS API won't persist through an upgrade, scale, update or reboot. Also, any change to the nodes' extensions like the **CustomScriptExtension** can lead to unexpected behavior and should be prohibited.
Avoid performing changes to the agent nodes unless Microsoft Support directs you to make changes.

AKS manages the lifecycle and operations of agent nodes on your behalf and modifying the IaaS resources associated with the agent nodes is **not supported**. An example of an unsupported operation is customizing a node pool virtual machine scale set by manually changing configurations in the Azure portal or from the API.

For workload-specific configurations or packages, AKS recommends using [Kubernetes daemon sets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

Using Kubernetes privileged `daemon sets`

and init containers enables you to tune/modify or install third party software on cluster agent nodes. Examples of such customizations include adding custom security scanning software or updating sysctl settings.

While this path is recommended if the above requirements apply, AKS engineering and support can't help troubleshoot or diagnose modifications that render the node unavailable due to a custom deployed `daemon set`

.

### Security issues and patching

If a security flaw is found in one or more of the managed components of AKS, the AKS team patches all affected clusters to mitigate the issue. Alternatively, the AKS team provides you with upgrade guidance.

For agent nodes affected by a security flaw, Microsoft notifies you with details on the impact and the steps to fix or mitigate the security issue.

### Node maintenance and access

Although you can sign in to and change agent nodes, doing this operation is discouraged because changes can make a cluster unsupportable.

## Network ports, access, and NSGs

You might only customize the NSGs on custom subnets. You might not customize NSGs on managed subnets or at the NIC level of the agent nodes. AKS has egress requirements to specific endpoints, to control egress and ensure the necessary connectivity, see [limit egress traffic](limit-egress-traffic). For ingress, the requirements are based on the applications you have deployed to cluster.

## Stopped, deallocated, and Not Ready nodes

If you don't need your AKS workloads to run continuously, you can [stop the AKS cluster](start-stop-cluster#stop-an-aks-cluster), which stops all nodepools and the control plane. You can start it again when needed. When you stop a cluster using the `az aks stop`

command, the cluster state is preserved for up to 12 months. After 12 months, the cluster state and all of its resources are deleted.

Manually deallocating all cluster nodes from the IaaS APIs, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal isn't supported to stop an AKS cluster or nodepool. The cluster will be considered out of support and stopped by AKS after 30 days. The clusters are then subject to the same 12 month preservation policy as a correctly stopped cluster.

Clusters with zero **Ready** nodes (or all **Not Ready**) and zero **Running** VMs will be stopped after 30 days.

AKS reserves the right to archive control planes that have been configured out of support guidelines for extended periods equal to and beyond 30 days. AKS maintains backups of cluster etcd metadata and can readily reallocate the cluster. This reallocation is initiated by any PUT operation bringing the cluster back into support, such as an upgrade or scale to active agent nodes.

All clusters in a suspended subscription will be stopped immediately and deleted after 90 days. All clusters in a deleted subscription will be deleted immediately.

## Unsupported alpha and beta Kubernetes features

AKS only supports stable and beta features within the upstream Kubernetes project. Unless otherwise documented, AKS doesn't support any alpha feature that is available in the upstream Kubernetes project.

## Preview features or feature flags

For features and functionality that requires extended testing and user feedback, Microsoft releases new preview features or features behind a feature flag. Consider these features as prerelease or beta features.

Preview features or feature-flag features aren't meant for production. Ongoing changes in APIs and behavior, bug fixes, and other changes can result in unstable clusters and downtime.

Features in public preview fall under **best effort** support, as these features are in preview and aren't meant for production. The AKS technical support teams provides support during business hours only. For more information, see [Azure Support FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

## Upstream bugs and issues

Given the speed of development in the upstream Kubernetes project, bugs invariably arise. Some of these bugs can't be patched or worked around within the AKS system. Instead, bug fixes require larger patches to upstream projects (such as Kubernetes, node or agent operating systems, and kernel). For components that Microsoft owns (such as the Azure cloud provider), AKS and Azure personnel are committed to fixing issues upstream in the community.

When the root cause of a technical support issue is due to one or more upstream bugs, AKS support and engineering teams will:

Identify and link the upstream bugs with any supporting details to help explain why this issue affects your cluster or workload. Customers receive links to the required repositories so they can watch the issues and see when a new release will provide fixes.

Provide potential workarounds or mitigation. If the issue can be mitigated, a

[known issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aknown-issue)is filed in the AKS repository. The known-issue filing explains:- The issue, including links to upstream bugs.
- The workaround and details about an upgrade or another persistence of the solution.
- Rough timelines for the issue's inclusion, based on the upstream release cadence.

# Deploy a highly available PostgreSQL database on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you deploy a highly available PostgreSQL database on AKS.

- If you still need to create the required infrastructure for this deployment, follow the steps in
[Create infrastructure for deploying a highly available PostgreSQL database on AKS](create-postgresql-ha)to get set up, and then return to this article.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Create secret for bootstrap app user

- Generate a secret to validate the PostgreSQL deployment by interactive login for a bootstrap app user using the
command.`kubectl create secret`


Important

Microsoft recommends that you use the most secure authentication flow available. The authentication flow described in this procedure requires a high degree of trust in the application and carries risks that are not present in other flows. You should only use this flow when other more secure flows, such as managed identities, aren't viable.

```
PG_DATABASE_APPUSER_SECRET=$(echo -n | openssl rand -base64 16)
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
--from-literal=username=app \
--from-literal=password="${PG_DATABASE_APPUSER_SECRET}" \
--namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \
--context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME
```


Validate that the secret was successfully created using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get secret db-user-pass --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME`


## Set environment variables for the PostgreSQL cluster

Deploy a ConfigMap to configure the CNPG operator using the following

command. These values replace the legacy`kubectl apply`

`ENABLE_AZURE_PVC_UPDATES`

toggle, which is no longer required, and help stagger upgrades and speed up replica reconnections. Before rolling this configuration into production, validate that any existing`DRAIN_TAINTS`

settings you rely on remain compatible with your Azure environment.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME -n $PG_NAMESPACE -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cnpg-controller-manager-config data: CLUSTERS_ROLLOUT_DELAY: '120' STANDBY_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT: '10' EOF`


## Install the Prometheus PodMonitors

Prometheus scrapes CNPG using the recording rules stored in the CNPG GitHub samples repo. Because the operator-managed PodMonitor is being deprecated, create and manage the PodMonitor resource yourself so you can tailor it to your monitoring stack.

Add the Prometheus Community Helm repo using the

command.`helm repo add`

`helm repo add prometheus-community \ https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts`

Upgrade the Prometheus Community Helm repo and install it on the primary cluster using the

command with the`helm upgrade`

`--install`

flag.`helm upgrade --install \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \ -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/main/docs/src/samples/monitoring/kube-stack-config.yaml \ prometheus-community \ prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \ --kube-context=$AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME`

Create a PodMonitor for the cluster. The CNPG team is deprecating the operator-managed PodMonitor, so you now manage it directly:

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -f - apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: PodMonitor metadata: name: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME namespace: ${PG_NAMESPACE} labels: cnpg.io/cluster: ${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME} spec: selector: matchLabels: cnpg.io/cluster: ${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME} podMetricsEndpoints: - port: metrics EOF`


## Create a federated credential

In this section, you create a federated identity credential for PostgreSQL backup to allow CNPG to use AKS workload identity to authenticate to the storage account destination for backups. The CNPG operator creates a Kubernetes service account with the same name as the cluster named used in the CNPG Cluster deployment manifest.

Get the OIDC issuer URL of the cluster using the

command.`az aks show`

`export AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show \ --name $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --query "oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl" \ --output tsv)"`

Create a federated identity credential using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`az identity federated-credential create \ --name $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_FED_CREDENTIAL_NAME \ --identity-name $AKS_UAMI_CLUSTER_IDENTITY_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --issuer "${AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_OIDC_ISSUER}" \ --subject system:serviceaccount:"${PG_NAMESPACE}":"${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME}" \ --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`


## Deploy a highly available PostgreSQL cluster

In this section, you deploy a highly available PostgreSQL cluster using the [CNPG Cluster custom resource definition (CRD)](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/cloudnative-pg.v1/#postgresql-cnpg-io-v1-ClusterSpec).

### Cluster CRD parameters

The following table outlines the key properties set in the YAML deployment manifest for the Cluster CRD:

| Property | Definition |
|---|---|
`imageName` |
Points to the CloudNativePG operand container image. Use `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-system-trixie` with the in-core backup integration shown in this guide, or switch to `18-standard-trixie` when you adopt the Barman Cloud plugin. |
`inheritedMetadata` |
Specific to the CNPG operator. The CNPG operator applies the metadata to every object related to the cluster. |
`annotations` |
Includes the DNS label required when exposing the cluster endpoints and enables
`alpha.cnpg.io/failoverQuorum` |

`labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true"`

`topologySpreadConstraints`

`"workload=postgres"`

.`resources`

*Guaranteed*. In a production environment, these values are key for maximizing usage of the underlying node VM and vary based on the Azure VM SKU used.`probes`

`startDelay`

configuration. Streaming startup and readiness probes help ensure replicas are healthy before serving traffic.`smartShutdownTimeout`

`bootstrap`

`storage`

`postgresql.synchronous`

`minSyncReplicas`

/`maxSyncReplicas`

and lets you specify synchronous replication behavior using the newer schema.`postgresql.parameters`

`postgresql.conf`

, `pg_hba.conf`

, and `pg_ident.conf`

. The sample emphasizes observability and WAL retention defaults that suit the AKS workload identity scenario but should be tuned per workload.`serviceAccountTemplate`

`barmanObjectStore`

To further isolate PostgreSQL workloads, you can add a taint (for example, `node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres=:NoSchedule`

) to your data plane nodes and replace the sample `nodeSelector`

/`tolerations`

with the values recommended by CloudNativePG. If you take this approach, label the nodes accordingly and confirm the AKS autoscaler policies align with your topology.

### PostgreSQL performance parameters

PostgreSQL performance heavily depends on your cluster's underlying resources and workload. The following table provides baseline guidance for a three-node cluster running on Standard D4s v3 nodes (16-GiB memory). Treat these values as a starting point and adjust them once you understand your workload profile:

| Property | Recommended value | Definition |
|---|---|---|
`wal_compression` |
lz4 | Compresses full-page writes written in WAL file with specified method |
`max_wal_size` |
6 GB | Sets the WAL size that triggers a checkpoint |
`checkpoint_timeout` |
15 min | Sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints |
`checkpoint_completion_target` |
0.9 | Balances checkpoint work across the checkpoint window |
`checkpoint_flush_after` |
2 MB | Number of pages after which previously performed writes are flushed to disk |
`wal_writer_flush_after` |
2 MB | Amount of WAL written out by WAL writer that triggers a flush |
`min_wal_size` |
2 GB | Sets the minimum size to shrink the WAL to |
`max_slot_wal_keep_size` |
10 GB | Upper bound for WAL left to service replication slots |
`shared_buffers` |
4 GB | Sets the number of shared memory buffers used by the server (25% of node memory in this example) |
`effective_cache_size` |
12 GB | Sets the planner's assumption about the total size of the data caches |
`work_mem` |
1/256th of node memory | Sets the maximum memory to be used for query workspaces |
`maintenance_work_mem` |
6.25% of node memory | Sets the maximum memory to be used for maintenance operations |
`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` |
2400 | Vacuum cost amount available before napping, for autovacuum |
`random_page_cost` |
1.1 | Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a nonsequentially fetched disk page |
`effective_io_concurrency` |
64 | Sets how many simultaneous requests the disk subsystem can handle efficiently |
`maintenance_io_concurrency` |
64 | A variant of "effective_io_concurrency" that is used for maintenance work |

### Deploying PostgreSQL

Deploy the PostgreSQL cluster with the Cluster CRD using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME -n $PG_NAMESPACE -v 9 -f - apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME annotations: alpha.cnpg.io/failoverQuorum: "true" spec: imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-system-trixie inheritedMetadata: annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PG_DNSPREFIX labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" instances: 3 smartShutdownTimeout: 30 probes: startup: type: streaming maximumLag: 32Mi periodSeconds: 5 timeoutSeconds: 3 failureThreshold: 120 readiness: type: streaming maximumLag: 0 periodSeconds: 10 failureThreshold: 6 topologySpreadConstraints: - maxSkew: 1 topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule labelSelector: matchLabels: cnpg.io/cluster: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME affinity: nodeSelector: workload: postgres resources: requests: memory: '8Gi' cpu: 2 limits: memory: '8Gi' cpu: 2 bootstrap: initdb: database: appdb owner: app secret: name: db-user-pass dataChecksums: true storage: storageClass: $POSTGRES_STORAGE_CLASS size: 64Gi postgresql: synchronous: method: any number: 1 parameters: wal_compression: lz4 max_wal_size: 6GB max_slot_wal_keep_size: 10GB checkpoint_timeout: 15min checkpoint_completion_target: '0.9' checkpoint_flush_after: 2MB wal_writer_flush_after: 2MB min_wal_size: 2GB shared_buffers: 4GB effective_cache_size: 12GB work_mem: 62MB maintenance_work_mem: 1GB autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit: "2400" random_page_cost: "1.1" effective_io_concurrency: "64" maintenance_io_concurrency: "64" log_checkpoints: 'on' log_lock_waits: 'on' log_min_duration_statement: '1000' log_statement: 'ddl' log_temp_files: '1024' log_autovacuum_min_duration: '1s' pg_stat_statements.max: '10000' pg_stat_statements.track: 'all' hot_standby_feedback: 'on' pg_hba: - host all all all scram-sha-256 serviceAccountTemplate: metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: "$AKS_UAMI_WORKLOAD_CLIENTID" labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: "https://${PG_PRIMARY_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}.blob.core.windows.net/backups" azureCredentials: inheritFromAzureAD: true retentionPolicy: '7d' EOF`


Note

The sample manifest uses the `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-system-trixie`

image because it works with the in-core Barman Cloud integration shown later. When you're ready to switch to the Barman Cloud plugin, update `spec.imageName`

to `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-standard-trixie`

and follow the [plugin configuration guidance](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/docs/intro/) before redeploying the cluster.

Important

The example `pg_hba`

entry allows non-TLS access. If you keep this configuration, document the security implications for your team and prefer encrypted connections wherever possible.

Validate that the primary PostgreSQL cluster was successfully created using the

command. The CNPG Cluster CRD specified three instances, which can be validated by viewing running pods once each instance is brought up and joined for replication. Be patient as it can take some time for all three instances to come online and join the cluster.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get pods --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -l cnpg.io/cluster=$PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME`

Example output

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw-1 1/1 Running 0 4m25s pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw-2 1/1 Running 0 3m33s pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw-3 1/1 Running 0 2m49s`


Important

If you use local NVMe with Azure Container Storage and a pod remains in the init state with a multi-attach error, the pod is still searching for the volume on a lost node. After the pod starts running, it enters a `CrashLoopBackOff`

state because CNPG creates a new replica on a new node without data and can't find the `pgdata`

directory. To resolve this issue, destroy the affected instance and bring up a new one. Run the following command:

```
kubectl cnpg destroy [cnpg-cluster-name] [instance-number]
```


## Validate the Prometheus PodMonitor is running

The manually created PodMonitor ties the kube-prometheus-stack scrape configuration to the CNPG pods you deployed earlier.

Validate the PodMonitor is running using the [ kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_get/) command.

```
kubectl --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \
--context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \
get podmonitors.monitoring.coreos.com \
$PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \
--output yaml
```


Example output

```
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
labels:
cnpg.io/cluster: pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw
name: pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw
namespace: cnpg-database
spec:
podMetricsEndpoints:
- port: metrics
selector:
matchLabels:
cnpg.io/cluster: pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw
```


If you're using Azure Monitor for Managed Prometheus, you need to add another pod monitor using the custom group name. Managed Prometheus doesn't pick up the custom resource definitions (CRDs) from the Prometheus community. Aside from the group name, the CRDs are the same. That design lets pod monitors for Managed Prometheus run alongside pod monitors that use the community CRD. If you're not using Managed Prometheus, you can skip this section. Create a new pod monitor:

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -f -
apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
name: cnpg-cluster-metrics-managed-prometheus
namespace: ${PG_NAMESPACE}
labels:
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
cnpg.io/cluster: ${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME}
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
cnpg.io/cluster: ${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME}
podMetricsEndpoints:
- port: metrics
EOF
```


Verify that the pod monitor is created (note the difference in the group name).

```
kubectl --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \
--context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \
get podmonitors.azmonitoring.coreos.com \
-l cnpg.io/cluster=$PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \
-o yaml
```


### Option A - Azure Monitor workspace

After you deploy the Postgres cluster and the pod monitor, you can view the metrics using the Azure portal in an Azure Monitor workspace.

### Option B - Managed Grafana

Alternatively, after you deploy the Postgres cluster and pod monitors, you can create a metrics dashboard on the Managed Grafana instance created by the deployment script to visualize the metrics exported to the Azure Monitor workspace. You can access the Managed Grafana via the Azure portal. Navigate to the Managed Grafana instance created by the deployment script and select the Endpoint link as shown here:

Selecting the Endpoint link opens a new browser window where you can create dashboards on the Managed Grafana instance. Following the instructions to [configure an Azure Monitor data source](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin#configure-an-azure-monitor-data-source-plug-in), you can then add visualizations to create a dashboard of metrics from the Postgres cluster. After setting up the data source connection, from the main menu, select the Data sources option. You should see a set of data source options for the data source connection as shown here:

On the Managed Prometheus option, select the option to build a dashboard to open the dashboard editor. After the editor window opens, select the Add visualization option then select the Managed Prometheus option to browse the metrics from the Postgres cluster. After you select the metric you want to visualize, select the Run queries button to fetch the data for the visualization as shown here:

Select the Save icon to add the panel to your dashboard. You can add other panels by selecting the Add button in the dashboard editor and repeating this process to visualize other metrics. Adding the metrics visualizations, you should have something that looks like this:

Select the Save icon to save your dashboard.
