Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you connect an MCP-compliant tool server with an AI toolchain operator (KAITO) inference workspace on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), enabling secure and modular tool calling for LLM applications. You also learn how to validate end-to-end tool invocation by integrating the model with the MCP server and monitoring real-time function execution through structured responses.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

As an extension of [KAITO inference with tool calling](ai-toolchain-operator-tool-calling), the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) provides a standardized way to define and expose tools for language models to call.

Tool calling with MCP makes it easier to connect language models to real services and actions without tightly coupling logic into the model itself. Instead of embedding every function or API call into your application code, MCP lets you run a standalone tool server that exposes standardized tools or APIs that any compatible LLM can use. This clean separation means you can update tools independently, share them across models, and manage them like any other microservice.

You can bring-your-own (BYO) internal or connect external MCP servers seamlessly with your KAITO inference workspace on AKS.

## MCP with AI toolchain operator (KAITO) on AKS

You can register an external MCP server in a uniform, schema-driven format and serve it to any compatible inference endpoint, including those [deployed with a KAITO workspace](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/#model-context-protocol-mcp). This approach allows for externalizing business logic, decoupling model behavior from tool execution, and reusing tools across agents, models, and environments.

In this guide, you register a pre-defined MCP server, test real calls issued by an LLM running in a KAITO inference workspace, and confirm the entire tool execution path (from model prompt to MCP function invocation) works as intended. You have flexibility to scale or swap tools independent of your model.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one by using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Your AKS cluster is running on Kubernetes version
`1.33`

or higher. To upgrade your cluster, see[Upgrade your AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster). - Install and configure Azure CLI version
`2.77.0`

or later. To find your version, run`az --version`

. To install or update, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You have the
[AI toolchain operator add-on enabled](ai-toolchain-operator)on your cluster and a[KAITO workspace with tool calling support](ai-toolchain-operator-tool-calling)deployed on your cluster. - An external MCP server available at an accessible URL (e.g.,
`https://mcp.example.com/mcp`

) that returns valid`/list_tools`

and has`stream`

transport.

## Connect to a reference MCP server

In this example, we'll use a reference [Time MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time#time-mcp-server), which provides time zone conversion capabilities and enables LLMs to get current time information and perform conversions using standardized names.

## Port-forward the KAITO inference service

Confirm that your KAITO workspace is ready and retrieve the inference service endpoint using the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get svc workspace‑phi‑4-mini-toolcall`

Note

The output might be a

`ClusterIP`

or internal address. Check which port(s) the service listens on. The default KAITO inference API is on port`80`

for HTTP. If it's only internal, you can port‑forward locally.Port-forward the inference service for testing using the

`kubectl port-forward`

command.`kubectl port-forward svc/workspace‑phi‑4‑mini-toolcall 8000:80`

Check

`/v1/models`

endpoint to confirm that`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

LLM is available using`curl`

.`curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models`

Your

`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

OpenAI-compatible inference API will be available at:`http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`


## Confirm the reference MCP server is valid

This example assumes that the Time MCP server is hosted at `https://mcp.example.com`

.

Confirm the server returns tools using

`curl`

.`curl https://mcp.example.com/mcp/list_tools`

Expected output:

`{ "tools": [ { "name": "get_current_time", "description": "Get the current time in a specific timezone", "arguments": { "timezone": "string" } }, { "name": "convert_time", "description": "Convert time between two timezones", "arguments": { "source_timezone": "string", "time": "string", "target_timezone": "string" } } ] }`


## Connect MCP server to the KAITO workspace using API request

KAITO automatically fetches tool definitions from **tools declared in API requests** or registered dynamically inside the inference runtime (vLLM + MCP tool loader).

In this guide, we create a Python virtual environment to send a tool-calling request to the `Phi-4-mini-instruct`

inference endpoint using the MCP definition and pointing to the server.

Define a new working directory for this test project.

`mkdir kaito-mcp cd kaito-mcp`

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it so that all packages are local to your test project.

`uv venv source .venv/bin/activate`

Use the open-source

[Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//index.html)framework to test the tool calling functionality and install its dependencies:`uv pip install "autogen-ext[openai]" "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[mcp]"`

Create a test file named

`test.py`

that:- Connects to the Time MCP server and loads
`get_current_time`

tool. - Connects to your KAITO inference service running at
`localhost:8000`

. - Sends an example query like “What time is it in Europe/Paris?”
- Enables automatic selection and calling of the
`get_current_time`

tool.

`import asyncio from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console from autogen_core import CancellationToken from autogen_core.models import ModelFamily, ModelInfo from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient from autogen_ext.tools.mcp import (StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter, StreamableHttpServerParams) from openai import OpenAI async def main() -> None: # Create server params for the Time MCP service server_params = StreamableHttpServerParams( url="https://mcp.example.com/mcp", timeout=30.0, terminate_on_close=True, ) # Load the get_current_time tool from the server adapter = await StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter.from_server_params(server_params, "get_current_time") # Fetch model name from KAITO's local OpenAI-compatible API model = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy").models.list().data[0].id model_info: ModelInfo = { "vision": False, "function_calling": True, "json_output": True, "family": ModelFamily.UNKNOWN, "structured_output": True, "multiple_system_messages": True, } # Connect to the KAITO inference workspace model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient( base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy", model=model, model_info=model_info ) # Define the assistant agent agent = AssistantAgent( name="time-assistant", model_client=model_client, tools=[adapter], system_message="You are a helpful assistant that can provide time information." ) # Run a test task that invokes the tool await Console( agent.run_stream( task="What time is it in Europe/Paris?", cancellation_token=CancellationToken() ) ) if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(main())`

- Connects to the Time MCP server and loads
Run the test script in your virtual environment.

`uv run test.py`

In the output of this test, you should expect the following:

- The model correctly generates a tool call using the MCP name and expected arguments.
- Autogen sends the tool call to the MCP server, the MCP server runs the logic and returns a result.
- The
`Phi-4-mini-instruct`

LLM interprets the raw tool output and provides a natural language response.

`---------- TextMessage (user) ---------- What time is it in Europe/Paris? ---------- ToolCallRequestEvent (time-assistant) ---------- [FunctionCall(id='chatcmpl-tool-xxxx', arguments='{"timezone": "Europe/Paris"}', name='get_current_time')] ---------- ToolCallExecutionEvent (time-assistant) ---------- [FunctionExecutionResult(content='{"timezone":"Europe/Paris","datetime":"2025-09-17T17:43:05+02:00","is_dst":true}', name='get_current_time', call_id='chatcmpl-tool-xxxx', is_error=False)] ---------- ToolCallSummaryMessage (time-assistant) ---------- The current time in Europe/Paris is 5:43 PM (CEST).`


## Experiment with more MCP tools

You can test the various tools available to this MCP server, such as `convert_time`

.

In your

`test.py`

file from the previous step, update your`adapter`

definition to the following:`adapter = await StreamableHttpMcpToolAdapter.from_server_params(server_params, "convert_time")`

Update your

`task`

definition to invoke the new tool. For example:`task="Convert 9:30 AM New York time to Tokyo time."`

Save and run the Python script.

`uv run test.py`

Expected output:

`9:30 AM in New York is 10:30 PM in Tokyo.`


## Troubleshooting

The following table outlines common errors when testing KAITO inference with an external MCP server and how to resolve them:

| Error | How to resolve |
|---|---|
`Tool not found` |
Ensure that your tool name matches the one declared in `/mcp/list_tools` . |
`401 Unauthorized` |
If your MCP server requires an Auth token, make sure to update `server_params` to include headers with the Auth token. |
`connection refused` |
Ensure the KAITO inference service is port-forwarded properly (e.g. to `localhost:8000` ). |
`tool call ignored` |
Review the
|

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to connect a KAITO workspace to an external reference MCP server using Autogen to enable tool calling through the OpenAI-compatible API. You also validated that the LLM could discover, invoke, and integrate results from MCP-compliant tools on AKS. To learn more, see the following resources:

# Customize cluster egress with outbound types in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Note

After [31 March 2026](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=default-outbound-access-for-vms-in-azure-will-be-retired-transition-to-a-new-method-of-internet-access), new AKS clusters that use the **AKS-managed virtual network** option will place cluster subnets into [private subnets](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access#why-is-disabling-default-outbound-access-recommended) by default (`defaultOutboundAccess = false`

).

This setting **does not impact AKS-managed cluster traffic**, which uses explicitly configured outbound paths. It may affect **unsupported scenarios**, such as deploying other resources (e.g., VMs) into the same subnet.

**Clusters using BYO VNets are unaffected** by this change. In supported configurations, no action is required.

You can customize egress for an AKS cluster to fit specific scenarios. By default, AKS creates a Standard Load Balancer to be set up and used for egress. However, the default setup may not meet the requirements of all scenarios if public IPs are disallowed or extra hops are required for egress.

This article covers the various types of outbound connectivity that are available in AKS clusters.

Note

You can now update the `outboundType`

after cluster creation.

Important

In nonprivate clusters, API server cluster traffic is routed and processed through the clusters outbound type. To prevent API server traffic from being processed as public traffic, consider using a [private cluster](private-clusters), or check out the [API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration) feature.

## Limitations

- Setting
`outboundType`

requires AKS clusters with a`vm-set-type`

of`VirtualMachineScaleSets`

and`load-balancer-sku`

of`Standard`

.

## Outbound types in AKS

You can configure an AKS cluster using the following outbound types: load balancer, NAT gateway, or user-defined routing. The outbound type impacts only the egress traffic of your cluster. For more information, see [setting up ingress controllers](ingress-basic).

### Outbound type of `loadBalancer`


The load balancer is used for egress through an AKS-assigned public IP. An outbound type of `loadBalancer`

supports Kubernetes services of type `loadBalancer`

, which expect egress out of the load balancer created by the AKS resource provider.

If `loadBalancer`

is set, AKS automatically completes the following configuration:

- A public IP address is created for cluster egress.
- The public IP address is assigned to the load balancer resource.
- Backend pools for the load balancer are set up for agent nodes in the cluster.

For more information, see [using a standard load balancer in AKS](load-balancer-standard).

### Outbound type of `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`


If `managedNatGateway`

or `userAssignedNatGateway`

are selected for `outboundType`

, AKS relies on [Azure Networking NAT gateway](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/manage-nat-gateway) for cluster egress.

- Select
`managedNatGateway`

when using managed virtual networks. AKS provisions a NAT gateway and attach it to the cluster subnet. - Select
`userAssignedNatGateway`

when using bring-your-own virtual networking. This option requires that you have a NAT gateway created before cluster creation.

For more information, see [using NAT gateway with AKS](nat-gateway).

### Outbound type of `userDefinedRouting`


Note

The `userDefinedRouting`

outbound type is an advanced networking scenario and requires proper network configuration.

If `userDefinedRouting`

is set, AKS doesn't automatically configure egress paths. The egress setup is completed by you.

You must deploy the AKS cluster into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is configured. Since you're not using a standard load balancer (SLB) architecture, you must establish explicit egress. This architecture requires explicitly sending egress traffic to an appliance like a firewall, gateway, proxy or to allow NAT to be done by a public IP assigned to the standard load balancer or appliance.

For more information, see [configuring cluster egress via user-defined routing](egress-udr).

### Outbound type of `none`


Important

The `none`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure the cluster operates as expected without unintended dependencies on external services. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `none`

is set, AKS won't automatically configure egress paths. This option is similar to `userDefinedRouting`

but does **not** require a default route as part of validation.

The `none`

outbound type is supported in both bring-your-own (BYO) virtual network scenarios and managed VNet scenarios. However, you must ensure that the AKS cluster is deployed into a network environment where explicit egress paths are defined if needed. For BYO VNet scenarios, the cluster must be deployed into an existing virtual network with a subnet that is already configured. Since AKS doesn't create a standard load balancer or any egress infrastructure, you must establish explicit egress paths if needed. Egress options can include routing traffic to a firewall, proxy, gateway, or other custom network configurations.

### Outbound type of `block`

(Preview)

Important

The `block`

outbound type is only available with [Network Isolated Cluster](concepts-network-isolated) and requires careful planning to ensure no unintended network dependencies exist. For fully isolated clusters, see [isolated cluster considerations](concepts-network-isolated).

If `block`

is set, AKS configures network rules to **actively block all egress traffic** from the cluster. This option is useful for highly secure environments where outbound connectivity must be restricted.

When using `block`

:

- AKS ensures that no public internet traffic can leave the cluster through network security group (NSG) rules. VNet traffic isn't affected.
- You must explicitly allow any required egress traffic through extra network configurations.

The `block`

option provides another level of network isolation but requires careful planning to avoid breaking workloads or dependencies.

## Updating `outboundType`

after cluster creation

Changing the outbound type after cluster creation deploys or removes resources as required to put the cluster into the new egress configuration.

The following tables show the supported migration paths between outbound types for managed and BYO virtual networks.

### Supported Migration Paths for Managed VNet

Each row shows whether the outbound type can be migrated to the types listed across the top. "Supported" means migration is possible, while "Not Supported" or "N/A" means it isn't.

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported |
`block` |
Supported | Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A |

### Supported Migration Paths for BYO VNet

| From|To | `loadBalancer` |
`managedNATGateway` |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
`userDefinedRouting` |
`none` |
`block` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`loadBalancer` |
N/A | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`managedNATGateway` |
Not Supported | N/A | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |
`userAssignedNATGateway` |
Supported | Not Supported | N/A | Supported | Supported | Not Supported |
`userDefinedRouting` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | N/A | Supported | Not Supported |
`none` |
Supported | Not Supported | Supported | Supported | N/A | Not Supported |

Migration is only supported between `loadBalancer`

, `managedNATGateway`

(if using a managed virtual network), `userAssignedNATGateway`

and `userDefinedRouting`

(if using a custom virtual network).

Warning

Migrating the outbound type to user managed types (`userAssignedNATGateway`

or `userDefinedRouting`

) will change the outbound public IP addresses of the cluster.
if [Authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges) is enabled, ensure new outbound IP range is appended to authorized IP range.

Warning

Changing the outbound type on a cluster is disruptive to network connectivity and results in a change of the cluster's egress IP address. If any firewall rules are configured to restrict traffic from the cluster, you need to update them to match the new egress IP address.

### Update cluster to use a new outbound type

Note

You must use a version >= 2.56 of Azure CLI to migrate outbound type. Use `az upgrade`

to update to the latest version of Azure CLI.

- Update the outbound configuration of your cluster using the
command.`az aks update`


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to managedNATGateway

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type managedNATGateway --nat-gateway-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>
```


### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to loadbalancer

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> \
--outbound-type loadBalancer \
<--load-balancer-managed-outbound-ip-count <number of managed outbound ip>| --load-balancer-outbound-ips <outbound ip ids> | --load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes <outbound ip prefix ids> >
```


Warning

Don't reuse an IP address that is already in use in prior outbound configurations.

### Update cluster from managedNATGateway to userDefinedRouting

- Add route
`0.0.0.0/0`

default route table. Please see[Customize cluster egress with a user-defined routing table in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](egress-udr)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userDefinedRouting
```


### Update cluster from loadbalancer to userAssignedNATGateway in BYO vnet scenario

- Associate nat gateway with subnet where the workload is associated with. Refer to
[Create a managed or user-assigned NAT gateway](nat-gateway)

```
az aks update --resource-group <resourceGroup> --name <clusterName> --outbound-type userAssignedNATGateway
```
