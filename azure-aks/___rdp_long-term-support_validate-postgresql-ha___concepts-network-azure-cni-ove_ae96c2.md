# Connect with RDP to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster Windows Server nodes for maintenance or troubleshooting

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Throughout the lifecycle of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you may need to access an AKS Windows Server node. This access could be for maintenance, log collection, or other troubleshooting operations. You can access the AKS Windows Server nodes using RDP. For security purposes, the AKS nodes aren't exposed to the internet.

Alternatively, if you want to SSH to your AKS Windows Server nodes, you need access to the same key-pair that was used during cluster creation. Follow the steps in [SSH into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes](ssh).

This article shows you how to create an RDP connection with an AKS node using their private IP addresses.

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster with a Windows Server node. If you need an AKS cluster, see the article on [creating an AKS cluster with a Windows container using the Azure CLI](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-cli). You need the Windows administrator username and password for the Windows Server node you want to troubleshoot. You also need an RDP client such as [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://aka.ms/rdmac).

If you need to reset the password, use `az aks update`

to change the password.

```
az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --windows-admin-password $WINDOWS_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```


If you need to reset the username and password, see [Reset Remote Desktop Services or its administrator password in a Windows VM](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/reset-rdp).

You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.61 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Deploy a virtual machine to the same subnet as your cluster

The Windows Server nodes of your AKS cluster don't have externally accessible IP addresses. To make an RDP connection, you can deploy a virtual machine with a publicly accessible IP address to the same subnet as your Windows Server nodes.

The following example creates a virtual machine named *myVM* in the *myResourceGroup* resource group.

You need to get the subnet ID used by your Windows Server node pool and query for:

- The cluster's node resource group
- The virtual network
- The subnet's name
- The subnet ID

```
CLUSTER_RG=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)
VNET_NAME=$(az network vnet list --resource-group $CLUSTER_RG --query [0].name -o tsv)
SUBNET_NAME=$(az network vnet subnet list --resource-group $CLUSTER_RG --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --query [0].name -o tsv)
SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $CLUSTER_RG --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $SUBNET_NAME --query id -o tsv)
```


Now that you've the SUBNET_ID, run the following command in the same Azure Cloud Shell window to create the VM:

```
PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS="myVMPublicIP"
az vm create \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myVM \
--image win2019datacenter \
--admin-username azureuser \
--admin-password {admin-password} \
--subnet $SUBNET_ID \
--nic-delete-option delete \
--os-disk-delete-option delete \
--nsg "" \
--public-ip-address $PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS \
--query publicIpAddress -o tsv
```


The following example output shows the VM has been successfully created and displays the public IP address of the virtual machine.

```
13.62.204.18
```


Record the public IP address of the virtual machine. You'll use this address in a later step.

## Allow access to the virtual machine

AKS node pool subnets are protected with NSGs (Network Security Groups) by default. To get access to the virtual machine, you'll have to enabled access in the NSG.

Note

The NSGs are controlled by the AKS service. Any change you make to the NSG will be overwritten at any time by the control plane.

First, get the resource group and name of the NSG to add the rule to:

```
CLUSTER_RG=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)
NSG_NAME=$(az network nsg list --resource-group $CLUSTER_RG --query [].name -o tsv)
```


Then, create the NSG rule:

```
az network nsg rule create \
--name tempRDPAccess \
--resource-group $CLUSTER_RG \
--nsg-name $NSG_NAME \
--priority 100 \
--destination-port-range 3389 \
--protocol Tcp \
--description "Temporary RDP access to Windows nodes"
```


## Get the node address

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. If you use Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl`

is already installed. To install `kubectl`

locally, use the [az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command:

```
az aks install-cli
```


To configure `kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the [az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```


List the internal IP address of the Windows Server nodes using the [kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command:

```
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```


The following example output shows the internal IP addresses of all the nodes in the cluster, including the Windows Server nodes.

```
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION INTERNAL-IP EXTERNAL-IP OS-IMAGE KERNEL-VERSION CONTAINER-RUNTIME
aks-nodepool1-42485177-vmss000000 Ready agent 18h v1.12.7 10.240.0.4 <none> Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS 4.15.0-1040-azure docker://3.0.4
aksnpwin000000 Ready agent 13h v1.12.7 10.240.0.67 <none> Windows Server Datacenter 10.0.17763.437
```


Record the internal IP address of the Windows Server node you wish to troubleshoot. You'll use this address in a later step.

## Connect to the virtual machine and node

Connect to the public IP address of the virtual machine you created earlier using an RDP client such as [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://aka.ms/rdmac).

After you have connected to your virtual machine, connect to the *internal IP address* of the Windows Server node you want to troubleshoot using an RDP client from within your virtual machine.

You're now connected to your Windows Server node.

You can now run any troubleshooting commands in the *cmd* window. Since Windows Server nodes use Windows Server Core, there's not a full GUI or other GUI tools when you connect to a Windows Server node over RDP.

## Remove RDP access

When done, exit the RDP connection to the Windows Server node then exit the RDP session to the virtual machine. After you exit both RDP sessions, delete the virtual machine with the [az vm delete](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-delete) command:

```
# Delete the virtual machine
az vm delete \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myVM
```


Delete the public IP associated with the virtual machine:

```
az network public-ip delete \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name $PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
```


Delete the NSG rule:

```
CLUSTER_RG=$(az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv)
NSG_NAME=$(az network nsg list --resource-group $CLUSTER_RG --query [].name -o tsv)
az network nsg rule delete \
--resource-group $CLUSTER_RG \
--nsg-name $NSG_NAME \
--name tempRDPAccess
```


## Connect with Azure Bastion

Alternatively, you can use [Azure Bastion](/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) to connect to your Windows Server node.

### Deploy Azure Bastion

To deploy Azure Bastion, you'll need to find the virtual network your AKS cluster is connected to.

- In the Azure portal, go to
**Virtual networks**. Select the virtual network your AKS cluster is connected to. - Under
**Settings**, select**Bastion**, then select**Deploy Bastion**. Wait until the process is finished before going to the next step.

### Connect to your Windows Server nodes using Azure Bastion

Go to the node resource group of the AKS cluster. Run the command below in the Azure Cloud Shell to get the name of your node resource group:

```
az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --query 'nodeResourceGroup' -o tsv
```


- Select
**Overview**, and select your Windows node pool virtual machine scale set. - Under
**Settings**, select**Instances**. Select a Windows server node that you'd like to connect to. - Under
**Support + troubleshooting**, select**Bastion**. - Enter the credentials you set up when the AKS cluster was created. Select
**Connect**.

You can now run any troubleshooting commands in the *cmd* window. Since Windows Server nodes use Windows Server Core, there's not a full GUI or other GUI tools when you connect to a Windows Server node over RDP.

Note

If you close out of the terminal window, press **CTRL + ALT + End**, select **Task Manager**, select **More details**, select **File**, select **Run new task**, and enter **cmd.exe** to open another terminal. You can also logout and re-connect with Bastion.

### Remove Bastion access

When you're finished, exit the Bastion session and remove the Bastion resource.

- In the Azure portal, go to
**Bastion**and select the Bastion resource you created. - At the top of the page, select
**Delete**. Wait until the process is complete before proceeding to the next step. - In the Azure portal, go to
**Virtual networks**. Select the virtual network that your AKS cluster is connected to. - Under
**Settings**, select**Subnet**, and delete the**AzureBastionSubnet**subnet that was created for the Bastion resource.

## Next steps

If you need more troubleshooting data, you can [view the Kubernetes primary node logs](monitor-aks#aks-control-plane-resource-logs) or [Azure Monitor](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview).

# Long-term support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) versions

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The Kubernetes community releases a new minor version approximately every four months, with a support window for each version for one year. In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), this support window is called *community support*.

AKS supports versions of Kubernetes that are within this *community support* window to push bug fixes and security updates from community releases. While the community support release cadence provides benefits, it requires that you keep up to date with Kubernetes releases, which can be difficult depending on your application's dependencies and the pace of change in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

To help you manage your Kubernetes version upgrades, AKS provides a *long-term support* (LTS) option, which extends the support window for a Kubernetes version to give you more time to plan and test upgrades to newer Kubernetes versions.

## AKS support types

After approximately one year, a given Kubernetes minor version exits *community support*, making bug fixes and security updates unavailable for your AKS clusters.

AKS offers one year of *community support* and one year of *long-term support* to backport security fixes from the upstream community. The upstream LTS working group contributes to the community, extending the support window. LTS provides more time to plan and test upgrades over two years from the Kubernetes version's general availability (GA).

| Community support | Long-term support | |
|---|---|---|
When to use |
When you can keep up with upstream Kubernetes releases | When you need control over when to migrate from one version to another |
Supported versions |
Three most recent GA minor versions | All supported Kubernetes versions from 1.27 onward are eligible for Long-Term Support (LTS). |

## LTS Patch process

LTS supports only the two most recent patch versions. This differs from Community support, where all patch versions are supported. However, AKS reserves the right to deprecate any patch version in response to critical security vulnerabilities (CVEs). For more details on community support policy, see [Kubernetes version support policy](supported-kubernetes-versions#kubernetes-version-support-policy).

To identify the latest supported patch versions, refer to the [AKS release tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/webpage/index.html).

We recommend enabling the [auto-upgrade patch channel](auto-upgrade-cluster) to ensure your clusters remain up-to-date with the latest patches.

## Enable long-term support

**Enabling LTS requires moving your cluster to the Premium tier and explicitly selecting the LTS support plan**. While it's possible to enable LTS when the cluster is in *community support*, you're charged once you enable the Premium tier.

Note

We strongly recommend enabling the patch auto-upgrade channel to ensure your cluster always receives the latest supported patches. LTS only supports the last two patch versions for each minor version. Clusters not on the latest patches may lose support.

### Enable LTS on a new cluster

Create a new cluster with LTS enabled using the

command.`az aks create`

The following command creates a new AKS cluster with LTS enabled using Kubernetes version 1.27 as an example. To review available Kubernetes releases, see the

[AKS release tracker](release-tracker).`az aks create \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --name <cluster-name> \ --tier premium \ --k8s-support-plan AKSLongTermSupport \ --kubernetes-version 1.27 \ --auto-upgrade-channel patch \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Enable LTS on an existing cluster

Enable LTS on an existing cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --tier premium --k8s-support-plan AKSLongTermSupport --auto-upgrade-channel patch`


Tip

To see which Kubernetes versions you can upgrade to, use the [AKS release tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/webpage/index.html) or run `az aks get-upgrades --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>`

.

## Migrate to the latest LTS version

The upstream Kubernetes community supports a two-minor-version upgrade path. The process migrates the objects in your Kubernetes cluster as part of the upgrade process, and provides a tested and accredited migration path.

If you want to carry out an in-place migration, the AKS service migrates your control plane from the previous LTS version to the latest, and then migrate your data plane. To carry out an in-place upgrade to the latest LTS version, you need to specify an LTS enabled Kubernetes version as the upgrade target.

Migrate to the latest LTS version using the

command.`az aks upgrade`

The following command uses Kubernetes version 1.32.2 as an example version. To review available Kubernetes releases, see the

[AKS release tracker](release-tracker).`az aks upgrade --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --kubernetes-version 1.32.2`

Note

Moving forward, all AKS Kubernetes versions will be LTS-compatible. For the latest LTS calendar, visit the

[AKS Kubernetes Release Calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar). To view available LTS releases and their patches by region, see the[AKS release tracker](release-tracker).

## Disable long-term support on an existing cluster

**Disabling LTS on an existing cluster requires moving your cluster to the free or standard tier and explicitly selecting the KubernetesOfficial support plan**.

There are approximately two years between one LTS version and the next. In lieu of upstream support for migrating more than two minor versions, there's a high likelihood your application depends on Kubernetes APIs that are deprecated. We recommend you thoroughly test your application on the target LTS Kubernetes version and carry out a blue/green deployment from one version to another.

Disable LTS on an existing cluster using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --tier [free|standard] --k8s-support-plan KubernetesOfficial`

Upgrade the cluster to a later supported version using the

command.`az aks upgrade`

The following command uses Kubernetes version 1.28.3 as an example version. To review available Kubernetes releases, see the

[AKS release tracker](release-tracker).`az aks upgrade --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --kubernetes-version 1.28.3`


## Unsupported add-ons and features

The AKS team currently tracks add-on versions where Kubernetes community support exists. Once a version leaves community support, we rely on open-source projects for managed add-ons to continue that support. Due to various external factors, some add-ons and features might not support Kubernetes versions outside these upstream community support windows.

The following table provides a list of add-ons and features that aren't supported and the reasons they're unsupported:

| Add-on / Feature | Reason it's unsupported |
|---|---|
| Calico | Requires Calico Enterprise agreement past community support. |
| Key Management Service (KMS) | KMSv2 replaces KMS during this LTS cycle. |
| Dapr | AKS extensions aren't supported. |
| Application Gateway Ingress Controller | Migration to App Gateway for Containers happens during LTS period. |
| Open Service Mesh | OSM is deprecated. |
| AAD Pod Identity | Deprecated in place of Workload Identity. |

Note

You can't move your cluster to long-term support if any of these add-ons or features are enabled.

While these AKS managed add-ons aren't supported by Microsoft, you can install their open-source versions on your cluster if you want to use them past community support.

## How we decide the next LTS version

Versions of Kubernetes LTS are available for two years from GA, and we mark a higher version of Kubernetes as LTS based on the following criteria:

- That sufficient time elapsed for customers to migrate from the prior LTS version to the current LTS version.
- The previous version completed a two year support window.

Read the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) to stay informed of when you're able to plan your migration.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I create a new AKS cluster with an LTS version after community support ends?

Yes, you can create a new AKS cluster using an LTS version even after its community support period has ended, provided you have opted into LTS. However, this is only valid until the end of the LTS version's lifecycle. After that, you must upgrade to the next supported LTS version. For more details, see the [AKS Kubernetes Release Calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar).

### Can I enable and disable LTS on an AKS-supported version after community support ends?

Yes, you can enable the LTS support plan on any AKS-supported version even after its community support period has ended. However, once the community support period has ended, you can't disable LTS for that version.

### Does a community-supported AKS cluster automatically become LTS eligible after End of Life?

No, you must explicitly enable LTS on the cluster to receive support. This also requires upgrading to the Premium tier. Refer to the [Premium tier pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/) for more information.

### Will every AKS version support Long-Term Support (LTS)?

Yes, AKS ensures that all supported Kubernetes versions are eligible for Long-Term Support (LTS). You can opt into LTS for any supported version available today.

### What is the pricing model for LTS?

LTS is available on the Premium tier refer to the [Premium tier pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/) for more information.

### Will enabling LTS disrupt workloads?

No. It’s a configuration-only change; it doesn’t reimage nodes or disrupt workloads, so no downtime is expected.

# Validate and test a PostgreSQL database deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you perform various testing and validation steps on a PostgreSQL database deployed on AKS. This includes verifying the deployment, connecting to the database, and testing failover scenarios.

- If you haven't already deployed PostgreSQL, follow the steps in
[Deploy a highly available PostgreSQL database on AKS with Azure CLI](deploy-postgresql-ha)to get set up, and then you can return to this article.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## Inspect the deployed PostgreSQL cluster

Validate that PostgreSQL is spread across multiple availability zones by retrieving the AKS node details using the [ kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_get/) command.

```
kubectl get nodes \
--context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \
--namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \
--output json | jq '.items[] | {node: .metadata.name, zone: .metadata.labels."failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone"}'
```


Your output should resemble the following example output with the availability zone shown for each node:

```
{
"node": "aks-postgres-15810965-vmss000000",
"zone": "westus3-1"
}
{
"node": "aks-postgres-15810965-vmss000001",
"zone": "westus3-2"
}
{
"node": "aks-postgres-15810965-vmss000002",
"zone": "westus3-3"
}
{
"node": "aks-systempool-26112968-vmss000000",
"zone": "westus3-1"
}
{
"node": "aks-systempool-26112968-vmss000001",
"zone": "westus3-2"
}
```


## Connect to PostgreSQL and create a sample dataset

In this section, you create a table and insert some data into the app database that was created in the CNPG Cluster CRD you deployed earlier. You use this data to validate the backup and restore operations for the PostgreSQL cluster.

Create a table and insert data into the app database using the following commands:

`kubectl cnpg psql $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

`-- Create a small dataset CREATE TABLE datasample (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR(255)); INSERT INTO datasample (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John'); INSERT INTO datasample (id, name) VALUES (2, 'Jane'); INSERT INTO datasample (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Alice'); SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datasample;`

Type

`\q`

to exit psql when finished.Your output should resemble the following example output:

`CREATE TABLE INSERT 0 1 INSERT 0 1 INSERT 0 1 count ------- 3 (1 row)`


## Connect to PostgreSQL read-only replicas

Connect to the PostgreSQL read-only replicas and validate the sample dataset using the following commands:

`kubectl cnpg psql --replica $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

`SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();`

Example output

`pg_is_in_recovery ------------------- t (1 row)`

`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datasample;`

Example output

`count ------- 3 (1 row)`


## Set up on-demand and scheduled PostgreSQL backups using Barman

Note

CloudNativePG is expected to deprecate native Barman Cloud support in favor of the [Barman Cloud plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/docs/intro/) in an upcoming 1.29 release. The steps in this guide continue to work today, but plan to migrate to the plugin once it stabilizes.

Validate that the PostgreSQL cluster can access the Azure storage account specified in the CNPG Cluster CRD and that

`Working WAL archiving`

reports as`OK`

using the following command:`kubectl cnpg status $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME 1 \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`Continuous Backup status First Point of Recoverability: Not Available Working WAL archiving: OK WALs waiting to be archived: 0 Last Archived WAL: 00000001000000000000000A @ 2024-07-09T17:18:13.982859Z Last Failed WAL: -`

Deploy an on-demand backup to Azure Storage, which uses the AKS workload identity integration, using the YAML file with the

command.`kubectl apply`

`export BACKUP_ONDEMAND_NAME="on-demand-backup-1" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -v 9 -f - apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Backup metadata: name: $BACKUP_ONDEMAND_NAME spec: method: barmanObjectStore cluster: name: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME EOF`

Validate the status of the on-demand backup using the

command.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe backup $BACKUP_ONDEMAND_NAME \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`Type Reason Age From Message ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- Normal Starting 6s cloudnative-pg-backup Starting backup for cluster pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw Normal Starting 5s instance-manager Backup started Normal Completed 1s instance-manager Backup completed`

Validate that the cluster has a first point of recoverability using the following command:

`kubectl cnpg status $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME 1 \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`Continuous Backup status First Point of Recoverability: 2024-06-05T13:47:18Z Working WAL archiving: OK`

Configure a scheduled backup for

*every hour at 15 minutes past the hour*using the YAML file with thecommand.`kubectl apply`

`export BACKUP_SCHEDULED_NAME="scheduled-backup-1" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -v 9 -f - apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: ScheduledBackup metadata: name: $BACKUP_SCHEDULED_NAME spec: # Backup once per hour schedule: "0 15 * ? * *" backupOwnerReference: self cluster: name: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME EOF`

Validate the status of the scheduled backup using the

command.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe scheduledbackup $BACKUP_SCHEDULED_NAME \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

View the backup files stored on Azure blob storage for the primary cluster using the

command.`az storage blob list`

`az storage blob list \ --account-name $PG_PRIMARY_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \ --container-name backups \ --query "[*].name" \ --only-show-errors`

Your output should resemble the following example output, validating the backup was successful:

`[ "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/base/20240605T134715/backup.info", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/base/20240605T134715/data.tar", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000001", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000002", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000003", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000003.00000028.backup", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000004", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000005", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000005.00000028.backup", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000006", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000007", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000008", "pg-primary-cnpg-r8c7unrw/wals/0000000100000000/000000010000000000000009" ]`


## Restore the on-demand backup to a new PostgreSQL cluster

In this section, you restore the on-demand backup you created earlier using the CNPG operator into a new instance using the bootstrap Cluster CRD. A single instance cluster is used for simplicity. Remember that the AKS workload identity (via CNPG inheritFromAzureAD) accesses the backup files, and that the recovery cluster name is used to generate a new Kubernetes service account specific to the recovery cluster.

You also create a second federated credential to map the new recovery cluster service account to the existing UAMI that has "Storage Blob Data Contributor" access to the backup files on blob storage.

Create a second federated identity credential using the

command.`az identity federated-credential create`

`export PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED="$PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME-recovered-db" az identity federated-credential create \ --name $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED \ --identity-name $AKS_UAMI_CLUSTER_IDENTITY_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --issuer "${AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_OIDC_ISSUER}" \ --subject system:serviceaccount:"${PG_NAMESPACE}":"${PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED}" \ --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange`

Restore the on-demand backup using the Cluster CRD with the

command.`kubectl apply`

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE -v 9 -f - apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED spec: inheritedMetadata: annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PG_DNSPREFIX labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" instances: 1 affinity: nodeSelector: workload: postgres # Point to cluster backup created earlier and stored on Azure Blob Storage bootstrap: recovery: source: clusterBackup storage: size: 2Gi pvcTemplate: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 2Gi storageClassName: managed-csi-premium volumeMode: Filesystem walStorage: size: 2Gi pvcTemplate: accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 2Gi storageClassName: managed-csi-premium volumeMode: Filesystem serviceAccountTemplate: metadata: annotations: azure.workload.identity/client-id: "$AKS_UAMI_WORKLOAD_CLIENTID" labels: azure.workload.identity/use: "true" externalClusters: - name: clusterBackup barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: https://${PG_PRIMARY_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}.blob.core.windows.net/backups serverName: $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME azureCredentials: inheritFromAzureAD: true wal: maxParallel: 8 EOF`

Connect to the recovered instance, then validate that the dataset created on the original cluster where the full backup was taken is present using the following command:

`kubectl cnpg psql $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datasample;`

Example output

`count ------- 3 (1 row) Type \q to exit psql`

Delete the recovered cluster using the following command:

`kubectl cnpg destroy $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED 1 \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Delete the federated identity credential using the

command.`az identity federated-credential delete`

`az identity federated-credential delete \ --name $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME_RECOVERED \ --identity-name $AKS_UAMI_CLUSTER_IDENTITY_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \ --yes`


## Expose the PostgreSQL cluster using a public load balancer

In this section, you configure the necessary infrastructure to publicly expose the PostgreSQL read-write and read-only endpoints with IP source restrictions to the public IP address of your client workstation.

You also retrieve the following endpoints from the Cluster IP service:

*One*primary read-write endpoint that ends with`*-rw`

.*Zero to N*(depending on the number of replicas) read-only endpoints that end with`*-ro`

.*One*replication endpoint that ends with`*-r`

.

Get the Cluster IP service details using the

command.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get services \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \ -l cnpg.io/cluster=$PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME`

Example output

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-r ClusterIP 10.0.193.27 <none> 5432/TCP 3h57m pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-ro ClusterIP 10.0.237.19 <none> 5432/TCP 3h57m pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-rw ClusterIP 10.0.244.125 <none> 5432/TCP 3h57m`

Note

There are three services:

`namespace/cluster-name-ro`

mapped to port 5433,`namespace/cluster-name-rw`

, and`namespace/cluster-name-r`

mapped to port 5433. It’s important to avoid using the same port as the read/write node of the PostgreSQL database cluster. If you want applications to access only the read-only replica of the PostgreSQL database cluster, direct them to port 5433. The final service is typically used for data backups but can also function as a read-only node.Get the service details using the

command.`kubectl get`

`export PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_RW_SERVICE=$(kubectl get services \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ -l "cnpg.io/cluster" \ --output json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name | endswith("-rw")) | .metadata.name') echo $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_RW_SERVICE export PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_RO_SERVICE=$(kubectl get services \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ -l "cnpg.io/cluster" \ --output json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name | endswith("-ro")) | .metadata.name') echo $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_RO_SERVICE`

Configure the load balancer service with the following YAML files using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NODERG_NAME service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PUBLICIP_NAME service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PG_DNSPREFIX name: cnpg-cluster-load-balancer-rw namespace: "${PG_NAMESPACE}" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - protocol: TCP port: 5432 targetPort: 5432 selector: cnpg.io/instanceRole: primary cnpg.io/podRole: instance loadBalancerSourceRanges: - "$MY_PUBLIC_CLIENT_IP/32" EOF cat <<EOF | kubectl apply --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NODERG_NAME service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PUBLICIP_NAME service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PG_DNSPREFIX name: cnpg-cluster-load-balancer-ro namespace: "${PG_NAMESPACE}" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - protocol: TCP port: 5433 targetPort: 5432 selector: cnpg.io/instanceRole: replica cnpg.io/podRole: instance loadBalancerSourceRanges: - "$MY_PUBLIC_CLIENT_IP/32" EOF`

Get the service details using the

command.`kubectl describe`

`kubectl describe service cnpg-cluster-load-balancer-rw \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE kubectl describe service cnpg-cluster-load-balancer-ro \ --context $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE export AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ALB_DNSNAME="$(az network public-ip show \ --resource-group $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NODERG_NAME \ --name $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_PUBLICIP_NAME \ --query "dnsSettings.fqdn" --output tsv)" echo $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ALB_DNSNAME`


### Validate public PostgreSQL endpoints

In this section, you validate that the Azure Load Balancer is properly set up using the static IP that you created earlier and routing connections to the primary read-write and read-only replicas and use the psql CLI to connect to both.

Remember that the primary read-write endpoint maps to TCP port 5432 and the read-only replica endpoints map to port 5433 to allow the same PostgreSQL DNS name to be used for readers and writers.

Note

You need the value of the app user password for PostgreSQL basic auth that was generated earlier and stored in the `$PG_DATABASE_APPUSER_SECRET`

environment variable.

Validate the public PostgreSQL endpoints using the following

`psql`

commands:`echo "Public endpoint for PostgreSQL cluster: $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ALB_DNSNAME" # Query the primary, pg_is_in_recovery = false psql -h $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ALB_DNSNAME \ -p 5432 -U app -d appdb -W -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"`

Example output

`pg_is_in_recovery ------------------- f (1 row)`

`echo "Query a replica, pg_is_in_recovery = true" psql -h $AKS_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_ALB_DNSNAME \ -p 5433 -U app -d appdb -W -c "SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();"`

Example output

`# Example output pg_is_in_recovery ------------------- t (1 row)`

When successfully connected to the primary read-write endpoint, the PostgreSQL function returns

`f`

for*false*, indicating that the current connection is writable.When connected to a replica, the function returns

`t`

for*true*, indicating the database is in recovery and read-only.

## Simulate an unplanned failover

In this section, you trigger a sudden failure by deleting the pod running the primary, which simulates a sudden crash or loss of network connectivity to the node hosting the PostgreSQL primary.

Check the status of the running pod instances using the following command:

`kubectl cnpg status $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`Name Current LSN Rep role Status Node --------------------------- ----------- -------- ------- ----------- pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-1 0/9000060 Primary OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000000 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-2 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000001 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-3 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000002`

Delete the primary pod using the

command.`kubectl delete`

`PRIMARY_POD=$(kubectl get pod \ --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE \ --no-headers \ -o custom-columns=":metadata.name" \ -l role=primary) kubectl delete pod $PRIMARY_POD --grace-period=1 --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Validate that the

`pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-2`

pod instance is now the primary using the following command:`kubectl cnpg status $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-2 0/9000060 Primary OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000001 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-1 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000000 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-3 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000002`

Reset the

`pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-1`

pod instance as the primary using the following command:`kubectl cnpg promote $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME 1 --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Validate that the pod instances have returned to their original state before the unplanned failover test using the following command:

`kubectl cnpg status $PG_PRIMARY_CLUSTER_NAME --namespace $PG_NAMESPACE`

Example output

`Name Current LSN Rep role Status Node --------------------------- ----------- -------- ------- ----------- pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-1 0/9000060 Primary OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000000 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-2 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000001 pg-primary-cnpg-sryti1qf-3 0/9000060 Standby (sync) OK aks-postgres-32388626-vmss000002`


## Clean up resources

Once you're finished reviewing your deployment, delete all the resources you created in this guide using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --no-wait --yes`

# Overview of Azure CNI Overlay networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure CNI Overlay is a networking model for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that provides efficient IP address management and high-performance pod communication. This article provides an overview of Azure CNI Overlay, including its architecture, IP address planning, and differences from the traditional kubenet networking model.

## Overview of overlay networking

The traditional [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](configure-azure-cni) assigns a virtual network IP address to every pod. It assigns this IP address from a reserved set of IPs on every node *or* a separate subnet reserved for pods. This approach requires IP address planning and might lead to address exhaustion, which introduces difficulties scaling your clusters as your application demands grow.

In overlay networking, only the Kubernetes cluster nodes are assigned IPs from subnets. Pods receive IPs from a private Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range provided at the time of cluster creation. Each node is assigned a `/24`

address space carved out from the same CIDR. Extra nodes created when you scale out a cluster automatically receive `/24`

address spaces from the same CIDR. Azure CNI assigns IPs to pods from this `/24`

space.

A separate routing domain is created in the Azure networking stack for the pod's private CIDR space. This domain creates an overlay network for direct communication between pods. There's no need to provision custom routes on the cluster subnet or use an encapsulation method to tunnel traffic between pods, which provides connectivity performance between pods on par with virtual machines (VMs) in a virtual network. Workloads running within the pods aren't even aware that network address manipulation is happening.


Communication with endpoints outside the cluster, such as on-premises and peered virtual networks, uses the node IP through network address translation (NAT). Azure CNI translates the source IP (overlay IP of the pod) of the traffic to the primary IP address of the VM. This translation enables the Azure networking stack to route the traffic to the destination.

Endpoints outside the cluster can't connect to a pod directly. You have to publish the pod's application as a Kubernetes Load Balancer service to make it reachable on the virtual network.

You can provide outbound (egress) connectivity to the internet for overlay pods by using a [standard load balancer](egress-outboundtype#outbound-type-of-loadbalancer) or [managed NAT gateway](nat-gateway). You can also control egress traffic by directing it to a firewall via [user-defined routes on the cluster subnet](egress-outboundtype#outbound-type-of-userdefinedrouting).

You can configure ingress connectivity to the cluster by using an ingress controller, such as Application Gateway for Containers, NGINX, or the application routing add-on.

## Differences between kubenet and Azure CNI Overlay

Like Azure CNI Overlay, kubenet assigns IP addresses to pods from an address space that's logically different from the virtual network, but it has scaling and other limitations. The following table provides a detailed comparison between kubenet and Azure CNI Overlay:

| Area | Azure CNI Overlay | kubenet |
|---|---|---|
| Cluster scale | 5,000 nodes and 250 pods per node | 400 nodes and 250 pods per node |
| Network configuration | Simple - no extra configurations required for pod networking | Complex - requires route tables and user-defined routes on the cluster subnet for pod networking |
| Pod connectivity performance | Performance on par with VMs in a virtual network | Extra hop adds latency |
| Kubernetes network policies | Azure network policies, Calico, Cilium | Calico |
| OS platforms supported | Linux, Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019 | Linux only |

Note

If you don't want to assign virtual network IP addresses to pods due to IP shortage, we recommend using Azure CNI Overlay.

## IP address planning

The following sections provide guidance on how to plan your IP address space for Azure CNI Overlay.

### Cluster nodes

When you set up your AKS cluster, make sure that your virtual network subnets have enough room to grow for future scaling. You can assign each node pool to a dedicated subnet. A `/24`

subnet can fit up to 251 nodes because the first three IP addresses are reserved for management tasks.

### Pods

The `/24`

size that Azure CNI Overlay assigns is fixed and can't be increased or decreased. You can run up to 250 pods on a node. When you plan the pod address space, ensure that the private CIDR is large enough to provide `/24`

address spaces for new nodes to support future cluster expansion.

When you plan IP address space for pods, consider the following factors:

- You can use the same pod CIDR space on multiple independent AKS clusters in the same virtual network.
- Pod CIDR space must not overlap with the cluster subnet range.
- Pod CIDR space must not overlap with directly connected networks, like virtual network peering, Azure ExpressRoute, or VPN. If external traffic has source IPs in the pod CIDR range, it needs translation to a non-overlapping IP via Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) to communicate with the cluster.
- Pod CIDR space
*can only be expanded*.

### Kubernetes service address range

The size of the service address CIDR depends on the number of cluster services that you plan to create. It must be smaller than `/12`

. This range shouldn't overlap with the pod CIDR range, cluster subnet range, and IP range used in peered virtual networks and on-premises networks.

### Kubernetes service IP address for DNS

The IP address for DNS is within the Kubernetes service address range that cluster service discovery uses. Don't use the first IP address in your address range, because this address is used for the `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`

address.

Important

The private CIDR ranges available for the pod CIDR are defined in [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) and [RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598). Although we don't block the use of public IP ranges, they're considered out of Microsoft's support scope. We recommend using private IP ranges for the pod CIDR.

When you use Azure CNI in overlay mode, ensure that the pod CIDR doesn't overlap with any external IP addresses or networks (such as on-premises networks, peered virtual networks, or ExpressRoute). If an external host uses an IP within the pod CIDR, packets destined for that host from the pod might be redirected into the overlay network and SNAT'd by the node. This situation causes the external endpoint to become unreachable.

## Network security groups

Pod-to-pod traffic with Azure CNI Overlay isn't encapsulated, and subnet [network security group (NSG)](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) rules are applied. If the subnet NSG contains deny rules that would affect the pod CIDR traffic, make sure that the following rules are in place to ensure proper cluster functionality (in addition to all [AKS egress requirements](limit-egress-traffic)):

- Traffic from the node CIDR to the node CIDR on all ports and protocols
- Traffic from the node CIDR to the pod CIDR on all ports and protocols (required for service traffic routing)
- Traffic from the pod CIDR to the pod CIDR on all ports and protocols (required for pod-to-pod and pod-to-service traffic, including DNS)

Traffic from a pod to any destination outside the pod CIDR block uses SNAT to set the source IP to the IP of the node where the pod runs.

If you want to restrict traffic between workloads in the cluster, we recommend using [network policies](use-network-policies).

## Maximum pods per node

You can configure the maximum number of pods per node at the time of cluster creation or when you add a new node pool. The default for Azure CNI Overlay is 250. The maximum value that you can specify in Azure CNI Overlay is 250, and the minimum value is 10. The value for maximum pods per node that you configure during creation of a node pool applies to the nodes in that node pool only.

Choosing a network model

Azure CNI offers two IP addressing options for pods: *overlay networking* and the *traditional configuration that assigns virtual network IPs to pods*. The choice of which option to use for your AKS cluster is a balance between flexibility and advanced configuration needs. The following considerations help outline when each network model might be the most appropriate.

Use overlay networking when:

- You want to scale to a large number of pods but are limited by IP address space in your virtual network.
- Most of the pod communication is within the cluster.
- You don't need advanced AKS features, such as virtual nodes.

Use the traditional virtual network option when:

- You have available IP address space.
- Most of the pod communication is to resources outside the cluster.
- Resources outside the cluster need to reach pods directly.
- You need AKS advanced features, such as virtual nodes.

## Limitations with Azure CNI Overlay

Azure CNI Overlay has the following limitations:

- VM availability sets aren't supported.
- You can't use
[DCsv2-series](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dcv2-series)virtual machines in node pools. To meet requirements for confidential computing, consider using[DCasv5 or DCadsv5-series confidential VMs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dcasv5-dcadsv5-series)instead. - If you're using your own subnet to deploy the cluster, the names of the subnet, the virtual network, and the resource group that contains the virtual network must be 63 characters or fewer. These names are used as labels in AKS worker nodes, so they're subject to
[Kubernetes syntax rules for labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Manage your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters using AKS pricing tiers. This article explains the differences between these tiers, when to use each tier, and how to create or update AKS clusters using Azure CLI.

## About AKS pricing tiers

AKS offers three pricing tiers for cluster management: the **Free tier**, the **Standard tier**, and the **Premium tier**.

**SKU and tier relationship**:

**Base SKU clusters**: Can use any of the three pricing tiers (Free, Standard, or Premium).**Automatic SKU clusters**: Must use the Standard tier (automatically selected during cluster creation).

## AKS pricing tiers comparison

The following table compares the Free, Standard, and Premium pricing tiers for AKS cluster management:

| Tier | When to use | Supported cluster types | Pricing | Feature comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | • Development/testing environments. • Learning and evaluation scenarios. • Non-production workloads. |
• Development clusters or small scale testing environments. • Clusters with fewer than 10 nodes. |
• Free cluster management. • Pay-as-you-go for resources you consume. |
• Recommended for clusters with fewer than 10 nodes, but can support up to 1,000 nodes. • Includes all current AKS features. |
| Standard | • Production workloads requiring 99.9-99.95% API server uptime. • Workloads needing financial service level agreement (SLA) coverage. |
• Default tier for Automatic SKU clusters. • Enterprise-grade or production workloads. • Clusters with up to 5,000 nodes. |
• Pay-as-you-go for resources you consume. •
|
• Uptime SLA is enabled by default. • Greater cluster reliability. • Supports up to 5,000 nodes in a cluster. • Includes all current AKS features. |
| Premium | • Production workloads requiring 99.9-99.95% API server uptime. • Workloads requiring 24-month
• Regulated environments requiring extended maintenance. |
• Enterprise-grade or production workloads. • Clusters with up to 5,000 nodes. |
• Pay-as-you-go for resources you consume. •
|
• Includes all current AKS features. •
|

## Uptime SLA terms and conditions

Standard and Premium tiers include Uptime SLA by default:

**With availability zones**: 99.95% availability of the Kubernetes API server**Without availability zones**: 99.9% availability of the Kubernetes API server**Free tier**: Best-effort uptime (no SLA guarantee)

For more information, see the [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/kubernetes-service/v1_1/).

## Region availability

The following tables outline the availability of AKS pricing tiers by region:

| Region type | Available pricing tiers |
|---|---|
| Public regions and Azure Government regions where
|

- Standard tier

- Premium tier

[Private AKS clusters](private-clusters)in all public regions where AKS is supported- Standard tier

- Premium tier

## Prerequisites

- You need
[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)version 2.47.0 or later. Find the current version using the`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You can create your cluster in an existing resource group or create a new one. To learn more about resource groups and working with them, see
[managing resource groups using the Azure CLI](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli).

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article walks you through two ways to configure ingress controllers and ingress objects with the application routing add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

[Configuration of the NGINX ingress controller](#control-the-default-nginx-ingress-controller-configuration)such as creating multiple controllers, configuring private load balancers, and setting static IP addresses.[Configuration per ingress resource](#configuration-per-ingress-resource-through-annotations)through annotations.

## Prerequisites

- An AKS cluster with the
[application routing add-on](app-routing)enabled. `kubectl`

configured to connect to your AKS cluster. For more information, see[Connect to your AKS cluster](#connect-to-your-aks-cluster).

### Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use `kubectl`

, the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [ az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed.Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Configuration properties for NGINX ingress controllers

The application routing add-on uses a Kubernetes [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) called [ NginxIngressController](https://github.com/Azure/aks-app-routing-operator/blob/main/config/crd/bases/approuting.kubernetes.azure.com_nginxingresscontrollers.yaml) to configure NGINX ingress controllers. You can create more ingress controllers or modify existing configurations.

The following table lists properties you can set to configure an `NginxIngressController`

:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`controllerNamePrefix` |
string | Name for the managed NGINX Ingress Controller resources. | Yes | `nginx` |
`customHTTPErrors` |
array | Array of error codes to be sent to the default backend if there's an error. | No | |
`defaultBackendService` |
object | Service to route unmatched HTTP traffic. Contains nested properties: | No | |
`name` |
string | Service name. | Yes | |
`namespace` |
string | Service namespace. | Yes | |
`defaultSSLCertificate` |
object | Contains the default certificate for accessing the default backend service. Contains nested properties: | No | |
`forceSSLRedirect` |
boolean | Forces HTTPS redirection when a certificate is set. | No | `false` |
`keyVaultURI` |
string | URI for a Key Vault secret storing the certificate. | No | |
`secret` |
object | Holds secret information for the default SSL certificate. Contains nested properties: | No | |
`name` |
string | Secret name. | Yes | |
`namespace` |
string | Secret namespace. | Yes | |
`httpDisabled` |
boolean | Flag to disable HTTP traffic to the controller. | No | |
`ingressClassName` |
string | IngressClass name used by the controller. | Yes | `nginx.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com` |
`loadBalancerAnnotations` |
object | A map of annotations to control the behavior of the NGINX ingress controller's service by setting
|

`scaling`

`maxReplicas`

`100`

`minReplicas`

`2`

`threshold`

**scales quickly for sudden spikes,**`rapid`

**favors cost-effectiveness, and**`steady`

**is a mix.**`balanced`

`balanced`

## Control the default NGINX ingress controller configuration

When you enable the application routing add-on with NGINX, it creates an ingress controller called `default`

in the `app-routing-namespace`

configured with a public facing Azure load balancer. That ingress controller uses an ingress class name of `webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com`

.

You can also control if the default gets a public or an internal IP, or if it gets created at all when enabling the add-on.

Possible configuration options include:

: The default NGINX ingress controller isn't created and isn't deleted if it already exists. You should manually delete the default`None`

`NginxIngressController`

custom resource if desired.: The default NGINX ingress controller is created with an internal load balancer. Any annotation changes on the`Internal`

`NginxIngressController`

custom resource to make it external are overwritten.: The default NGINX ingress controller created with an external load balancer. Any annotation changes on the`External`

`NginxIngressController`

custom resource to make it internal are overwritten.(default): The default NGINX ingress controller is created with an external load balancer. You can edit the default`AnnotationControlled`

`NginxIngressController`

custom resource to configure load balancer annotations.)

### Control the default ingress controller configuration on a new cluster

Enable application routing on a new cluster using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--enable-app-routing`

and`--app-routing-default-nginx-controller`

flags. You need to set the`<DefaultIngressControllerType>`

to one of the configuration options described in[Control the default NGINX ingress controller configuration](#control-the-default-nginx-ingress-controller-configuration).`az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --location $LOCATION \ --enable-app-routing \ --app-routing-default-nginx-controller <DefaultIngressControllerType>`


### Update the default ingress controller configuration on an existing cluster

Update the application routing default ingress controller configuration on an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks approuting update`

`--nginx`

flag. You need to set the`<DefaultIngressControllerType>`

to one of the configuration options described in[Control the default NGINX ingress controller configuration](#control-the-default-nginx-ingress-controller-configuration).`az aks approuting update \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --nginx <DefaultIngressControllerType>`


## Create another public facing NGINX ingress controller

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

`nginx-public-controller.yaml`

and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-public spec: ingressClassName: nginx-public controllerNamePrefix: nginx-public`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-public-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-public created`


## Create an internal NGINX ingress controller with a private IP address

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

`nginx-internal-controller.yaml`

and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-internal spec: ingressClassName: nginx-internal controllerNamePrefix: nginx-internal loadBalancerAnnotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-internal-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-internal created`


## Create an NGINX ingress controller with a static IP address

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name $NETWORK_RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create a static public IP address using the

command.`az network public ip create`

`az network public-ip create \ --resource-group $NETWORK_RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $PUBLIC_IP_NAME \ --sku Standard \ --allocation-method static`

Note

If you're using a

*Basic*SKU load balancer in your AKS cluster, use`Basic`

for the`--sku`

parameter when defining a public IP. Only`Basic`

SKU IPs work with the*Basic*SKU load balancer and only`Standard`

SKU IPs work with the*Standard*SKU load balancers.Ensure the cluster identity used by the AKS cluster has delegated permissions to the public IP's resource group using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show --name $CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query identity.principalId -o tsv) RG_SCOPE=$(az group show --name $NETWORK_RESOURCE_GROUP --query id -o tsv) az role assignment create \ --assignee ${CLIENT_ID} \ --role "Network Contributor" \ --scope ${RG_SCOPE}`

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

`nginx-staticip-controller.yaml`

and save the file to your local computer.Note

You can either use

`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name`

for public IP name, or use`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

for an IPv4 address and`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6`

for an IPv6 address, as shown in the example YAML. Adding the`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name`

annotation ensures the most efficient Load Balancer creation and is highly recommended to avoid potential throttling.`apiVersion: approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/v1alpha1 kind: NginxIngressController metadata: name: nginx-static spec: ingressClassName: nginx-static controllerNamePrefix: nginx-static loadBalancerAnnotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: "$PUBLIC_IP_NAME" service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: "$NETWORK_RESOURCE_GROUP"`

Create the NGINX ingress controller resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f nginx-staticip-controller.yaml`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`nginxingresscontroller.approuting.kubernetes.azure.com/nginx-static created`


## Verify the ingress controller was created

Verify the status of the NGINX ingress controller using the

command.`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller --name $INGRESS_CONTROLLER_NAME`

The following example output shows the created resource. It may take a few minutes for the controller to be available:

`NAME INGRESSCLASS CONTROLLERNAMEPREFIX AVAILABLE nginx-public nginx-public nginx True`


### View the conditions of the ingress controller

View the conditions of the ingress controller to troubleshoot any issues using the

command.`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl get nginxingresscontroller --name $INGRESS_CONTROLLER_NAME -o jsonpath='{range .items[*].status.conditions[*]}{.lastTransitionTime}{"\t"}{.status}{"\t"}{.type}{"\t"}{.message}{"\n"}{end}'`

The following example output shows the conditions of a healthy ingress controller:

`2023-11-29T19:59:24Z True IngressClassReady Ingress Class is up-to-date 2023-11-29T19:59:50Z True Available Controller Deployment has minimum availability and IngressClass is up-to-date 2023-11-29T19:59:50Z True ControllerAvailable Controller Deployment is available 2023-11-29T19:59:25Z True Progressing Controller Deployment has successfully progressed`


## Use the ingress controller in an ingress

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

`ingress.yaml`

and save the file to your local computer.Note

Update

`<HostName>`

with your DNS host name. The`<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the`NginxIngressController`

.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: aks-helloworld namespace: hello-web-app-routing spec: ingressClassName: <IngressClassName> rules: - host: <HostName> http: paths: - backend: service: name: aks-helloworld port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix`

Create the cluster resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml --namespace hello-web-app-routing`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`ingress.networking.k8s.io/aks-helloworld created`


## Verify the managed ingress was created

Verify the managed ingress was created using the

command.`kubectl get ingress`

`kubectl get ingress --namespace hello-web-app-routing`

Your output should resemble the following example output:

`NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE aks-helloworld webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com myapp.contoso.com 20.51.92.19 80, 443 4m`


## Remove ingress controllers

Remove the NGINX ingress controller using the

command.`kubectl delete nginxingresscontroller`

`kubectl delete nginxingresscontroller --name $INGRESS_CONTROLLER_NAME`


## Configuration per ingress resource through annotations

The NGINX ingress controller supports adding [annotations to specific ingress objects](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/) to customize their behavior.

You can [annotate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) the ingress object by adding the respective annotation in the `metadata.annotations`

field.

Note

Annotation keys and values can only be strings. Other types, such as boolean or numeric values must be quoted. For example: `"true"`

, `"false"`

, `"100"`

.

The following sections provide examples for common configurations. For a full list, see the [NGINX ingress annotations documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/).

### Custom max body size

For NGINX, a 413 error is returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. To override the default value, use the annotation:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 4m
```


Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 4m
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: aks-helloworld
port:
number: 80
path: /
pathType: Prefix
```


### Custom connection timeout

You can change the timeout that the NGINX ingress controller waits to close a connection with your workload. All timeout values are unitless and in seconds. To override the default timeout, use the following annotation to set a valid 120-seconds proxy read timeout:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "120"
```


Review [custom timeouts](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#custom-timeouts) for other configuration options.

Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "120"
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: aks-helloworld
port:
number: 80
path: /
pathType: Prefix
```


### Backend protocol

The NGINX ingress controller uses `HTTP`

to reach the services by default. To configure alternative backend protocols such as `HTTPS`

or `GRPC`

, use one of the following annotations:

```
# HTTPS annotation
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
# GRPC annotation
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "GRPC"
```


Review [backend protocols](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#backend-protocol) for other configuration options.

Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: aks-helloworld
port:
number: 80
path: /
pathType: Prefix
```


### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in an Ingress rule, use the following annotation:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
```


Review [enable CORS](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#enable-cors) for other configuration options.

Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: "true"
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: aks-helloworld
port:
number: 80
path: /
pathType: Prefix
```


### Disable SSL redirect

The controller redirects (308) to HTTPS if TLS is enabled for an ingress by default. To disable this feature for specific ingress resources, use the following annotation:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
```


Review [server-side HTTPS enforcement through redirect](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#server-side-https-enforcement-through-redirect) for other configuration options.

Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- backend:
service:
name: aks-helloworld
port:
number: 80
path: /
pathType: Prefix
```


### URL rewriting

In some scenarios, the exposed URL in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. Without a rewrite any request returns 404. This configuration is useful with [path-based routing](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/ingress-path-matching/) where you can serve two different web applications under the same domain. You can set path expected by the service using the following annotation:

```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
```


Here's an example ingress configuration using this annotation:

Note

Update `<HostName>`

with your DNS host name.
The `<IngressClassName>`

is the one you defined when creating the `NginxIngressController`

.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: aks-helloworld
namespace: hello-web-app-routing
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
spec:
ingressClassName: <IngressClassName>
rules:
- host: <HostName>
http:
paths:
- path: /app-one(/|$)(.*)
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: app-one
port:
number: 80
- path: /app-two(/|$)(.*)
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: app-two
port:
number: 80
```


### NGINX health probe path update

The default health probe path for the Azure Load Balancer associated with the NGINX ingress controller must be set to `"/healthz"`

. To ensure correct health checks, verify that the ingress controller service has the following annotation:

```
metadata:
annotations:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path: "/healthz"
```


If you're using Helm to manage your NGINX ingress controller, you can define the Azure Load Balancer health-probe annotation in a values file and apply it during an upgrade:

```
controller:
service:
annotations:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path: "/healthz"
```


This configuration helps maintain service availability and avoids unexpected traffic disruption during upgrades.
