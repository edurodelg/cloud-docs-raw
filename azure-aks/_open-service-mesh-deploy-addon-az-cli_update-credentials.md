Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to install the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The OSM add-on installs the OSM mesh on your cluster. The OSM mesh is a service mesh that provides traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection for your applications. For more information about the OSM mesh, see [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/).

Warning

Microsoft has announced the retirement of the [Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). The upstream OSM project has also been retired by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/). Identify any existing OSM configurations and migrate them to equivalent Istio configurations. For migration steps, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

Important

Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.

| Kubernetes version | OSM version installed |
|---|---|
| 1.24.0 or greater | 1.2.5 |
| Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3 |
| Below 1.23.5 | 1.0.0 |

Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Install the OSM add-on on your cluster

If you don't have one already, create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create a new AKS cluster with the OSM add-on installed using the

command and specify`az aks create`

`open-service-mesh`

for the`--enable-addons`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-addons open-service-mesh \ --generate-ssh-keys`


Important

You can't enable the OSM add-on on an existing cluster if an OSM mesh is already on your cluster. Uninstall any existing OSM meshes on your cluster before enabling the OSM add-on.

When installing on an existing clusters, use the [ az aks enable-addons](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-enable-addons) command. The following code shows an example:

```
az aks enable-addons \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myAKSCluster \
--addons open-service-mesh
```


## Get the credentials for your cluster

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`


## Verify the OSM add-on is installed on your cluster

Verify the OSM add-on is installed on your cluster using the

command with and specify`az aks show`

`'addonProfiles.openServiceMesh.enabled'`

for the`--query`

parameter. In the output, under`addonProfiles`

, the`enabled`

value should show as`true`

for`openServiceMesh`

.`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query 'addonProfiles.openServiceMesh.enabled'`


## Verify the OSM mesh is running on your cluster

Verify the version, status, and configuration of the OSM mesh running on your cluster using the

`kubectl get deployment`

command and display the image version of the*osm-controller*deployment.`kubectl get deployment -n kube-system osm-controller -o=jsonpath='{$.spec.template.spec.containers[:1].image}'`

The following example output shows version

*0.11.1*of the OSM mesh:`mcr.microsoft.com/oss/openservicemesh/osm-controller:v0.11.1`

Verify the status of the OSM components running on your cluster using the following

`kubectl`

commands to show the status of the`app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io`

deployments, pods, and services.`kubectl get deployments -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io kubectl get pods -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io kubectl get services -n kube-system --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openservicemesh.io`

Important

If any pods have a status other than

`Running`

, such as`Pending`

, your cluster might not have enough resources to run OSM. Review the sizing for your cluster, such as the number of nodes and the virtual machine's SKU, before continuing to use OSM on your cluster.Verify the configuration of your OSM mesh using the

`kubectl get meshconfig`

command.`kubectl get meshconfig osm-mesh-config -n kube-system -o yaml`

The following example output shows the configuration of an OSM mesh:

`apiVersion: config.openservicemesh.io/v1alpha1 kind: MeshConfig metadata: creationTimestamp: "0000-00-00A00:00:00A" generation: 1 name: osm-mesh-config namespace: kube-system resourceVersion: "2494" uid: 6c4d67f3-c241-4aeb-bf4f-b029b08faa31 spec: certificate: serviceCertValidityDuration: 24h featureFlags: enableEgressPolicy: true enableMulticlusterMode: false enableWASMStats: true observability: enableDebugServer: true osmLogLevel: info tracing: address: jaeger.osm-system.svc.cluster.local enable: false endpoint: /api/v2/spans port: 9411 sidecar: configResyncInterval: 0s enablePrivilegedInitContainer: false envoyImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/envoyproxy/envoy:v1.18.3 initContainerImage: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/openservicemesh/init:v0.9.1 logLevel: error maxDataPlaneConnections: 0 resources: {} traffic: enableEgress: true enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode: true inboundExternalAuthorization: enable: false failureModeAllow: false statPrefix: inboundExtAuthz timeout: 1s useHTTPSIngress: false`

The example output shows

`enablePermissiveTrafficPolicyMode: true`

, which means OSM has permissive traffic policy mode enabled. With this mode enabled in your OSM mesh:- The
[SMI](https://smi-spec.io/)traffic policy enforcement is bypassed. - OSM automatically discovers services that are a part of the service mesh.
- OSM creates traffic policy rules on each Envoy proxy sidecar to be able to communicate with these services.

- The

## Delete your cluster

When you no longer need the cluster, you can delete it using the

command, which removes the resource group, the cluster, and all related resources.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait`


Note

Alternatively, you can uninstall the OSM add-on and the related resources from your cluster. For more information, see [Uninstall the Open Service Mesh add-on from your AKS cluster](open-service-mesh-uninstall-add-on).

## Next steps

This article showed you how to install the OSM add-on on an AKS cluster and verify it's installed and running. With the OSM add-on installed on your cluster, you can [deploy a sample application](https://release-v1-0.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) or [onboard an existing application](https://release-v1-0.docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/) to work with your OSM mesh.

# Update or rotate the credentials for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS clusters created with a service principal have a one-year expiration time. As you near the expiration date, you can reset the credentials to extend the service principal for an additional period of time. You might also want to update, or rotate, the credentials as part of a defined security policy. AKS clusters [integrated with Microsoft Entra ID](azure-ad-integration-cli) as an authentication provider have two more identities: the Microsoft Entra Server App and the Microsoft Entra Client App. This article details how to update the service principal and Microsoft Entra credentials for an AKS cluster.

Note

Alternatively, you can use a managed identity for permissions instead of a service principal. Managed identities don't require updates or rotations. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

## Before you begin

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.65 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update or create a new service principal for your AKS cluster

When you want to update the credentials for an AKS cluster, you can choose to either:

- Update the credentials for the existing service principal.
- Create a new service principal and update the cluster to use these new credentials.

Warning

If you choose to create a *new* service principal, wait around 30 minutes for the service principal permission to propagate across all regions. Updating a large AKS cluster to use these credentials can take a long time to complete.

### Check the expiration date of your service principal

To check the expiration date of your service principal, use the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command. The following example gets the service principal ID for the

`$CLUSTER_NAME`

cluster in the `$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

resource group using the [command. The service principal ID is set as a variable named](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)

`az aks show`

*SP_ID*.

```
SP_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv)
az ad app credential list --id "$SP_ID" --query "[].endDateTime" -o tsv
```


### Reset the existing service principal credentials

To update the credentials for an existing service principal, get the service principal ID of your cluster using the [ az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show) command. The following example gets the ID for the

`$CLUSTER_NAME`

cluster in the `$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

resource group. The variable named *SP_ID*stores the service principal ID used in the next step. These commands use the Bash command language.

Warning

When you reset your cluster credentials on an AKS cluster that uses Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, a [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) is performed to update your nodes with the new credential information.

```
SP_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv)
```


Use the variable *SP_ID* containing the service principal ID to reset the credentials using the [ az ad app credential reset](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-reset) command. The following example enables the Azure platform to generate a new secure secret for the service principal and store it as a variable named

*SP_SECRET*.

```
SP_SECRET=$(az ad app credential reset --id "$SP_ID" --query password -o tsv)
```


Next, you [update AKS cluster with service principal credentials](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials). This step is necessary to update the service principal on your AKS cluster.

### Create a new service principal

Note

If you updated the existing service principal credentials in the previous section, skip this section and instead [update the AKS cluster with service principal credentials](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials).

To create a service principal and update the AKS cluster to use the new credential, use the [ az ad sp create-for-rbac](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command.

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```


The output is similar to the following example output. Make a note of your own `appId`

and `password`

to use in the next step.

```
{
"appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"name": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```


Define variables for the service principal ID and client secret using your output from running the [ az ad sp create-for-rbac](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command. The

*SP_ID*is the

*appId*, and the

*SP_SECRET*is your

*password*.

```
SP_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
SP_SECRET=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```


Next, you [update AKS cluster with the new service principal credential](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials). This step is necessary to update the AKS cluster with the new service principal credential.

## Update AKS cluster with service principal credentials

Important

For large clusters, updating your AKS cluster with a new service principal can take a long time to complete. Consider reviewing and customizing the [node surge upgrade settings](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) to minimize disruption during the update. For small and midsize clusters, it takes a several minutes for the new credentials to update in the cluster.

Update the AKS cluster with your new or existing credentials by running the [ az aks update-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update-credentials) command.

```
az aks update-credentials \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--reset-service-principal \
--service-principal "$SP_ID" \
--client-secret "${SP_SECRET}"
```


## Update AKS cluster with new Microsoft Entra application credentials

You can create new Microsoft Entra server and client applications by following the [Microsoft Entra integration steps](azure-ad-integration-cli#create-azure-ad-server-component), or reset your existing Microsoft Entra applications following the [same method as for service principal reset](#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials). After that, you need to update your cluster Microsoft Entra application credentials using the [ az aks update-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update-credentials) command with the

*--reset-aad*variables.

```
az aks update-credentials \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--reset-aad \
--aad-server-app-id $SERVER_APPLICATION_ID \
--aad-server-app-secret $SERVER_APPLICATION_SECRET \
--aad-client-app-id $CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to update or rotate service principal and Microsoft Entra application credentials.
