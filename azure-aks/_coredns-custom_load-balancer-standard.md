# Customize CoreDNS for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) for cluster DNS management and resolution with all *1.12.x* and higher clusters. AKS is a managed service, so you can't modify the main configuration for CoreDNS (a *CoreFile*). Instead, you use a Kubernetes *ConfigMap* to override the default settings. To see the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMaps, use the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

This article shows you how to use ConfigMaps for basic CoreDNS customization options in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Note

Previously, AKS used `kube-dns`

for cluster DNS management and resolution, but it's now deprecated. `kube-dns`

offered different [customization options](https://www.danielstechblog.io/using-custom-dns-server-for-domain-specific-name-resolution-with-azure-kubernetes-service/) via a Kubernetes config map. CoreDNS is **not** backwards compatible with `kube-dns`

. You must update any previous customizations to work with CoreDNS.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Verify the version of CoreDNS you're running. The configuration values might change between versions.

## Plugin support

All built-in CoreDNS plugins are supported. No add-on/third party plugins are supported.

Important

When you create configurations like the ones in this article, the names you specify in the `data`

section must end in `.server`

or `.override`

. This naming convention is defined in the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMap, which you can view using the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

## Configure DNS name rewrites

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own fully qualified domain name (FQDN).`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { log errors rewrite stop { name regex (.*)\.<domain to be rewritten>\.com {1}.default.svc.cluster.local answer name (.*)\.default\.svc\.cluster\.local {1}.<domain to be rewritten>.com } forward . /etc/resolv.conf # You can redirect this to a specific DNS server such as 10.0.0.10, but that server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name }`

Important

If you redirect to a DNS server, such as the CoreDNS service IP, that DNS server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name.

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Verify the customizations were applied using the

command.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns-custom -o yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Specify a forward server for your network traffic

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace the`forward`

name and`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { forward foo.com 1.1.1.1 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Use custom domains

You might want to configure custom domains that can only be resolved internally. For example, you might want to resolve the custom domain *puglife.local*, which isn't a valid top-level domain. Without a custom domain ConfigMap, the AKS cluster can't resolve the address.

Create a new file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domain and IP address with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: puglife.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension puglife.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 192.11.0.1 # This is my test/dev DNS server }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Configure stub domains

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domains and IP addresses with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension abc.com:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 1.2.3.4 } my.cluster.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 2.3.4.5 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Add custom host-to-IP mappings

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the IP addresses and hostnames with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom # This is the name of the ConfigMap you can overwrite with your changes namespace: kube-system data: test.override: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .override file extension hosts { 10.0.0.1 example1.org 10.0.0.2 example2.org 10.0.0.3 example3.org fallthrough }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`

# Use a public standard load balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Azure Load Balancer](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model that supports both inbound and outbound scenarios. It distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to the back end pool instances.

A **public** load balancer integrated with AKS serves two purposes:

- Provide outbound connections to the cluster nodes inside the AKS virtual network (VNet) by translating the private IP address to a public IP address part of its
*outbound pool*. - Provide access to applications via Kubernetes services of type
`LoadBalancer`

, enabling you to easily scale your applications and create highly available services.

This article covers integration with a public load balancer on AKS. For internal load balancer integration, see [Use an internal load balancer in AKS](internal-lb).

## Prerequisites

- Azure Load Balancer is available in two SKUs:
*Basic*and*Standard*. The*Standard*SKU is used by default when you create an AKS cluster. The*Standard*SKU gives you access to added functionality, such as a larger backend pool,[multiple node pools](create-node-pools),[Availability Zones](availability-zones), and is[secure by default](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview#securebydefault). It's the recommended load balancer SKU for AKS. For more information on the*Basic*and*Standard*SKUs, see[Azure Load Balancer SKU comparison](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus). - For a full list of the supported annotations for Kubernetes services with type
`LoadBalancer`

, see[LoadBalancer annotations](https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/loadbalancer/#loadbalancer-annotations). - This article assumes you have an AKS cluster with the
*Standard*SKU Azure Load Balancer. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[the Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

Important

If you'd prefer to use your own gateway, firewall, or proxy to provide outbound connection, you can skip the creation of the load balancer outbound pool and respective frontend IP by using [ outbound type as UserDefinedRouting (UDR)](egress-outboundtype). The outbound type defines the egress method for a cluster and defaults to type

`LoadBalancer`

.## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support a load balancer with the *Standard* SKU:

AKS manages the lifecycle and operations of agent nodes. Modifying the IaaS resources associated with the agent nodes isn't supported. An example of an unsupported operation is making manual changes to the load balancer resource group.

At least one public IP or IP prefix is required for allowing egress traffic from the AKS cluster. The public IP or IP prefix is required to maintain connectivity between the control plane and agent nodes and to maintain compatibility with previous versions of AKS. You have the following options for specifying public IPs or IP prefixes with a

*Standard*SKU load balancer:- Provide your own public IPs.
- Provide your own public IP prefixes.
- Specify a number up to 100 to allow the AKS cluster to create that many
*Standard*SKU public IPs in the same resource group as the AKS cluster. This resource group is usually named with`MC_`

at the beginning. AKS assigns the public IP to the*Standard*SKU load balancer. By default, one public IP is automatically created in the same resource group as the AKS cluster if no public IP, public IP prefix, or number of IPs is specified. You also must allow public addresses and avoid creating any Azure policies that ban IP creation.

A public IP created by AKS can't be reused as a custom bring your own (BYO) public IP address. You must create and manage all custom IP addresses.

You can only define the load balancer SKU when you create an AKS cluster. You can't change the load balancer SKU after an AKS cluster has been created.

You can only use one type of load balancer SKU (

*Basic*or*Standard*) in a single cluster.*Standard*SKU load balancers only support*Standard*SKU IP addresses.[Private Link Service](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview)isn't supported when the load balancer backend pool type is set to`nodeIP`

.

## Create a load balancer service in AKS

After you create an AKS cluster with outbound type `LoadBalancer`

(default), your cluster is ready to use the load balancer to expose services.

Create a service manifest named

`public-svc.yaml`

, which creates a public service of type`LoadBalancer`

.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: public-svc spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: public-app`


## Specify the load balancer IP address

If you want to use a specific IP address with the load balancer, you have two options to specify the IP address:

**Set service annotations**(recommended): Use`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

for an IPv4 address and`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6`

for an IPv6 address.**Add the**: Add the*LoadBalancerIP*property to the load balancer YAML manifest`Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`

property to the load balancer YAML manifest. This field is deprecating following[upstream Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), and it can't support dual-stack. Current usage remains the same and existing services are expected to work without modification.

## Deploy the load balancer service manifest

Deploy the public service manifest using

and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f public-svc.yaml`

The Azure Load Balancer is configured with a new public IP that fronts the new service. Since the Azure Load Balancer can have multiple frontend IPs, each new service that you deploy gets a new dedicated frontend IP to be uniquely accessed.

Confirm your service is created and the load balancer is configured using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service public-svc`

When you view the service details, the public IP address created for this service on the load balancer is shown in the

*EXTERNAL-IP*column of the output. It might take a few minutes for the IP address to change from*<pending>*to an actual public IP address. The following example output shows successful creation of the service:`NAMESPACE NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE default public-svc LoadBalancer 10.0.39.110 203.0.113.187 80:32068/TCP 52s`

Get more detailed information about your service using the

`kubectl describe service`

command.`kubectl describe service public-svc`

The following example output is a condensed version of the output after you run

`kubectl describe service`

.*LoadBalancer Ingress*shows the external IP address exposed by your service.*IP*shows the internal addresses.`Name: public-svc Namespace: default Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Selector: app=public-app ... IP: 10.0.39.110 ... LoadBalancer Ingress: 203.0.113.187 ... TargetPort: 80/TCP NodePort: 32068/TCP ... Session Affinity: None External Traffic Policy: Cluster ...`
