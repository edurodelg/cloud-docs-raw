Troubleshooting Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster issues plays an important role in maintaining your cluster, especially if your cluster is running mission-critical workloads. AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems is an intelligent, self-diagnostic experience that:

- Helps you identify and resolve problems in your cluster.
- Requires no extra configuration or billing cost.

## Open AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems

You can access AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems using the following steps:

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource.From the service menu, select

**Diagnose and solve problems**.Select a troubleshooting category tile that best describes the issue of your cluster by referring the keywords in each tile description on the homepage or typing a keyword that best describes your issue in the search bar.


## View a diagnostic report

After selecting a category, you can view various diagnostic reports that provide detailed information about the issue. The *Overview* option from the navigation menu runs all the diagnostics in that particular category and displays any issues that are found with the cluster. Select **View details** under each tile to view a detailed description of the issue, including:

- An issue summary
- Error details
- Recommended actions
- Links to helpful docs
- Related-metrics
- Logging data

### Example scenario: Diagnose connectivity issues

I observed that my application is getting disconnected or experiencing intermittent connection issues. In response, I navigate to the AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems home page and select the **Connectivity Issues** tile to investigate the potential causes.

I received a diagnostic alert indicating that the disconnection might be related to my *Cluster DNS*. To gather more information, I select **View details**.

Based on the diagnostic result, it appears that the issue might be related to known DNS issues or the VNet configuration. I can use the documentation links provided to address the issue and resolve the problem.

If the recommended documentation based on the diagnostic results doesn't resolve the issue, I can return to the previous step in Diagnostics and refer to additional documentation.

## Use AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems for best practices

Deploying applications on AKS requires adherence to best practices to guarantee optimal performance, availability, and security. The AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems **Best Practices** tile provides an array of best practices that can assist in managing various aspects, such as VM resource provisioning, cluster upgrades, scaling operations, subnet configuration, and other essential aspects of a cluster's configuration.

Leveraging the AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems can be vital in ensuring that your cluster adheres to best practices and that any potential issues are identified and resolved in a timely and effective manner. By incorporating AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems into your operational practices, you can be confident in the reliability and security of your application in production.

### Example scenario: View best practices

I'm curious about the best practices I can follow to prevent potential problems. In response, I navigate to the AKS Diagnose and Solve Problems home page and select the **Best Practices** tile.

From here, I can view the best practices that are recommended for my cluster and select **View details** to see the results.

## Next steps

- Collect logs to help you further troubleshoot your cluster issues using
[AKS Periscope](https://aka.ms/aksperiscope). - Read the
[triage practices section](/en-us/azure/architecture/operator-guides/aks/aks-triage-practices)of the AKS day-2 operations guide. - Post your questions or feedback at
[UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/d365community/forum/aabe212a-f724-ec11-b6e6-000d3a4f0da0). Make sure to add "[Diag]" in the title.

# Troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion for a Standard Load Balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

If you know that you're starting many outbound TCP or UDP connections to the same destination IP address and port, and you observe failing outbound connections or support notifies you that you're exhausting SNAT ports, you have several general mitigation options. Review these options and decide what's best for your scenario. It's possible that one or more can help manage your scenario. For detailed information, review the [outbound connections troubleshooting guide](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/troubleshoot-outbound-connection).

The root cause of SNAT exhaustion is frequently an anti-pattern for how outbound connectivity is established, managed, or configurable timers changed from their default values.

This article helps you troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion issues when using a Standard Load Balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Steps to troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion

Use the following steps to troubleshoot SNAT port exhaustion:

- Check if your connections remain idle for a long time and rely on the default idle timeout for releasing that port. If so, the default timeout of 30 minutes might need to be reduced for your scenario.
- Investigate how your application creates outbound connectivity (for example: code review or packet capture).
- Determine if this activity is expected behavior or whether the application is misbehaving. Use
[metrics](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-diagnostics)and[logs](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/monitor-load-balancer)in Azure Monitor to substantiate your findings. For example, use the "Failed" category for SNAT connections metric. - Evaluate if appropriate
[design patterns](#snat-port-exhaustion-design-patterns)are followed. - Evaluate if SNAT port exhaustion should be mitigated with
[more outbound IP addresses and allocated outbound ports](configure-load-balancer-standard#configure-the-allocated-outbound-ports).

## SNAT port exhaustion design patterns

Take advantage of connection reuse and connection pooling whenever possible. These patterns help you avoid resource exhaustion problems and result in predictable behavior.

- Atomic requests (one request per connection) generally aren't a good design choice. Such anti-patterns limit scale, reduce performance, and decrease reliability. Instead, reuse HTTP/S connections to reduce the numbers of connections and associated SNAT ports. The application scale increases and performance improves because of reduced handshakes, overhead, and cryptographic operation cost when using TLS.
- If you're using out of cluster/custom DNS, or custom upstream servers on coreDNS, keep in mind that DNS can introduce many individual flows at volume when the client isn't caching the DNS resolvers result. Make sure to customize coreDNS first instead of using custom DNS servers and to define a good caching value.
- UDP flows (for example, DNS lookups) allocate SNAT ports during the idle timeout. The longer the idle timeout, the higher the pressure on SNAT ports. Use short idle timeout (for example, 4 minutes).
- Use connection pools to shape your connection volume.
- Never silently abandon a TCP flow and rely on TCP timers to clean up flow. If you don't let TCP explicitly close the connection, state remains allocated at intermediate systems and endpoints, and it makes SNAT ports unavailable for other connections. This pattern can trigger application failures and SNAT exhaustion.
- Don't change OS-level TCP close related timer values without expert knowledge of impact. While the TCP stack recovers, your application performance can be negatively affected when the endpoints of a connection have mismatched expectations. Wishing to change timers is usually a sign of an underlying design problem. Review following recommendations.
