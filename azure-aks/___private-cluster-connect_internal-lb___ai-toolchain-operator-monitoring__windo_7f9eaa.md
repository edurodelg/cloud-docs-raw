# Establish network connectivity to a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In private AKS clusters, the API server endpoint has no public IP address. To manage the API server, you need to use a virtual machine (VM) or container that has access to the virtual network (VNet) of the AKS cluster. There are several options for establishing network connectivity to the private cluster:

- Use an
[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/vnet/overview)instance deployed into a subnet that's connected to the API server for the cluster. - Use
[Azure Bastion](/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-to-aks-private-cluster)'s native client tunneling feature (preview). - Use a VM in a separate network and set up
[virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview). - Use a
[private endpoint](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview)connection. - Create a VM in the same VNet as the AKS cluster using the
command with the`az vm create`

`--vnet-name`

flag. - Use an
[Express Route or VPN](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways)connection. - Use the
[AKS](access-private-cluster).`command invoke`

feature

## Choose a connectivity option

Azure Cloud Shell and Azure Bastion (preview) are the easiest options. Express Route and VPNs add costs and require extra networking complexity. Virtual network peering requires you to plan your network CIDR ranges to ensure there are no overlapping ranges.

The following table outlines the key differences and limitations of using Azure Cloud Shell and Azure Bastion:

| Option | Azure Cloud Shell | Azure Bastion (preview) |
|---|---|---|
| Key differences | • Ephemeral, browser-based access. • Cost-effective. • Comes with preinstalled tools like `az cli` and `kubectl` . |
• Persistent, long-running access. • Suited for managing multiple clusters. • Use your own native client tooling. |
| Limitations | • Not supported with AKS Automatic clusters or clusters with network resource group (NRG) lockdown. • You can't have multiple Cloud Shell sessions in different VNets at the same time. |
• Not supported with AKS Automatic clusters or clusters with NRG lockdown. |

## Connect using Azure Cloud Shell

Connecting to a private AKS cluster through Azure Cloud Shell requires completing the following steps:

**Deploy required resources:**You need to deploy Cloud Shell in a VNet that can reach your private cluster. This step provisions the necessary infrastructure. While Cloud Shell is a free service, using Cloud Shell in a VNet requires some resources that incur cost. For more information, see[Deploy Cloud Shell in a virtual network](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/vnet/deployment).**Configure the connection:**After you deploy the resources, any user in the subscription that has appropriate permissions on the cluster can configure Cloud Shell to deploy in the VNet to allow a secure connection to the private cluster.

## Deploy required resources

To deploy and configure the required resources, you must have the **Owner** role assignment on the subscription. To view and assign roles, see [List Owners of a Subscription](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-portal#list-owners-of-a-subscription).

You can deploy the required resources using the Azure portal or the provided ARM template if you manage infrastructure as code or have organizational policies that require specific resource naming conventions.

You can optionally leave the deployed resources in place for future connections or delete and recreate them as needed.

### Use the Azure portal (preview)

This option creates a separate VNet with the necessary resources for Cloud Shell and configures VNet peering for you.

- In the
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your private cluster resource. - On the Overview page, select
**Connect**. - On the
**Cloud Shell**tab, under**Prerequisites for private cluster connection**, select**Configure**to deploy the necessary resources.- The deployment creates a new resource group named
`RG-CloudShell-PrivateClusterConnection-{RANDOM_ID}`

.

- The deployment creates a new resource group named
- Once the deployment succeeds, under
**Set cluster context**, select**Open Cloud Shell**.


Note

If you already configured Cloud Shell in a VNet for a particular cluster, repeating these steps ensures your Cloud Shell user settings are correctly aligned with that VNet.

### Use an ARM template

To have more control over the deployment configuration, use the [provided ARM template](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/vnet/deployment).

You can deploy Cloud Shell in the same VNet as your AKS private cluster with a dedicated subnet, or you can deploy in a new VNet and connect via [VNet peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

## Configure connection to the private cluster

After you [deploy the required resources](#deploy-required-resources), any user in the subscription can configure their Cloud Shell to deploy in the given VNet using the steps in [Configure Cloud Shell to use a virtual network](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/vnet/deployment#5-configure-cloud-shell-to-use-a-virtual-network).

Ensure the user has appropriate Kubernetes-level access to successfully connect to the private cluster. For more information, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-identity).

## Connect using Azure Bastion (preview)

Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that you provision to securely connect to private resources via private IP addresses. To use Bastion's native client tunneling feature, see [Connect to AKS private cluster using Azure Bastion](/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-to-aks-private-cluster).

## Connect using virtual network (VNet) peering

To use VNet peering, you need to set up a link between the VNet and the private DNS zone. You can set up VNet peering using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### Use the Azure portal

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your node resource group and select your**private DNS zone resource**.In the service menu, under

**DNS Management**, select**Virtual Network Links**>**Add**.On the

**Add Virtual Network Link**page, configure the following settings:**Link name**: Enter a name for the virtual network link.**Virtual Network**: Select the virtual network that contains the VM.

Select

**Create**to create the virtual network link.Navigate to the resource group that contains the virtual network of your AKS cluster and select your

**virtual network resource**.In the service menu, under

**Settings**, select**Peerings**>**Add**.On the

**Add peering**page, configure the following settings:**Peering link name**: Enter a name for the peering link.**Virtual network**: Select the virtual network of the VM.

Select

**Add**to create the peering link.

For more information, see [Virtual network peering](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview).

### Use the Azure CLI

Create a new link to add the virtual network of the VM to the private DNS zone using the

command.`az network private-dns link vnet create`

`az network private-dns link vnet create \ --name <new-link-name> \ --resource-group <node-resource-group-name> \ --zone-name <private-dns-zone-name> \ --virtual-network <vm-virtual-network-resource-id> \ --registration-enabled false`

Create a peering between the virtual network of the VM and the virtual network of the node resource group using the

command.`az network vnet peering create`

`az network vnet peering create \ --name <new-peering-name-1> \ --resource-group <vm-virtual-network-resource-group-name> \ --vnet-name <vm-virtual-network-name> \ --remote-vnet <node-resource-group-virtual-network-resource-id> \ --allow-vnet-access`

Create a second peering between the virtual network of the node resource group and the virtual network of the VM using the

command.`az network vnet peering create`

`az network vnet peering create \ --name <new-peering-name-2> \ --resource-group <node-resource-group-name> \ --vnet-name <node-resource-group-virtual-network-name> \ --remote-vnet <vm-virtual-network-resource-id> \ --allow-vnet-access`

List the virtual network peerings you created using the

command.`az network vnet peering list`

`az network vnet peering list \ --resource-group <node-resource-group-name> \ --vnet-name <private-dns-zone-name>`


## Use a private endpoint connection

You can set up a private endpoint so that a VNet doesn't need to be peered to communicate with the private cluster. To set up a private endpoint connection, you first create a new private endpoint in the virtual network containing the consuming resources, and then create a link between your virtual network and a new private DNS zone in the same network.

Important

If the virtual network is configured with custom DNS servers, you need to set up private DNS appropriately for the environment. For more information, see the [Virtual network name resolution documentation](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances#name-resolution-that-uses-your-own-dns-server).

### Create a private endpoint resource

From the

[Azure portal home page](https://portal.azure.com), select**Create a resource**.Search for

**Private Endpoint**and select**Create**>**Private Endpoint**.Select

**Create**.On the

**Basics**tab, configure the following settings:**Project details****Subscription**: Select the subscription where your private cluster is located.**Resource group**: Select the resource group that contains your virtual network.

**Instance details****Name**: Enter a name for your private endpoint, such as*myPrivateEndpoint*.**Region**: Select the same region as your virtual network.


Select

**Next: Resource**and configure the following settings:**Connection method**: Select**Connect to an Azure resource in my directory**.**Subscription**: Select the subscription where your private cluster is located.**Resource type**: Select**Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters**.**Resource**: Select your private cluster.**Target sub-resource**: Select**management**.

Select

**Next: Virtual Network**and configure the following settings:**Networking****Virtual network**: Select your virtual network.**Subnet**: Select your subnet.


Select

**Next: DNS**>**Next: Tags**and (optionally) set up key-values as needed.Select

**Next: Review + create**>**Create**.

Once the resource is created, record the private IP address of the private endpoint for future use.

### Create a private DNS zone

Once you create the private endpoint, create a new private DNS zone with the same name as the private DNS zone created by the private cluster. Remember to create this DNS zone in the VNet containing the consuming resources.

In the Azure portal, navigate to your node resource group and select your

**private DNS zone resource**.In the service menu, under

**DNS Management**, select**Recordsets**and note the following:- The name of the private DNS zone, which follows the pattern
`*.privatelink.<region>.azmk8s.io`

. - The name of the
`A`

record (excluding the private DNS name). - The time-to-live (TTL).

- The name of the private DNS zone, which follows the pattern
From the

[Azure portal home page](https://portal.azure.com), select**Create a resource**.Search for

**Private DNS zone**and select**Create**>**Private DNS zone**.On the

**Basics**tab, configure the following settings:**Project details**- Select your
**Subscription**. - Select the
**Resource group**where you created the private endpoint.

- Select your
**Instance details****Name**: Enter the name of the DNS zone retrieved from previous steps.**Region**: Defaults to the location of your resource group.


Select

**Review + create**>**Create**.

### Create an `A`

record

Once the private DNS zone is created, create an `A`

record, which associates the private endpoint to the private cluster.

Navigate to your private DNS zone resource.

In the service menu, under

**DNS Management**, select**Recordsets**>**Add**.On the

**Add record set**page, configure the following settings:**Name**: Enter the name retrieved from the`A`

record in the private cluster's DNS zone.**Type**: Select**A - Address record**.**TTL**: Enter the number from the`A`

record in the private cluster's DNS zone.**TTL unit**: Change the dropdown value to match the one in the`A`

record from the private cluster's DNS zone.**IP address**: Enter the**IP address of the private endpoint you created**.

Select

**Add**to create the`A`

record.

Important

When creating the `A`

record, only use the name and not the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

### Link the private DNS zone to the virtual network

Once the `A`

record is created, link the private DNS zone to the virtual network that will access the private cluster.

Navigate to your private DNS zone resource.

In the service menu, under

**DNS Management**, select**Virtual Network Links**>**Add**.On the

**Add Virtual Network Link**page, configure the following settings:**Link name**: Enter a name for your virtual network link.**Subscription**: Select the subscription where your private cluster is located.**Virtual Network**: Select the virtual network of your private cluster.

Select

**Create**to create the link.It might take a few minutes for the operation to complete. Once the virtual network link is created, you can access it from the

**Virtual Network Links**tab you used in step 2.

Warning

- If the private cluster is stopped and restarted, the private cluster's original private link service is removed and recreated, which breaks the connection between your private endpoint and the private cluster. To resolve this issue, delete and recreate any user-created private endpoints linked to the private cluster. If the recreated private endpoints have new IP addresses, you also need to update DNS records.
- If you update the DNS records in the private DNS zone, ensure the host that you're trying to connect from is using the updated DNS records. You can verify this using the
`nslookup`

command. If you notice the updates aren't reflected in the output, you might need to flush the DNS cache on your machine and try again.

## Create a VM in the same virtual network

To create a VM in the same VNet as your private AKS cluster, use the [ az vm create](/en-us/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create) command with the

`--vnet-name`

flag to specify the VNet.```
az vm create \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--name <vm-name> \
--image <image-name> \
--vnet-name <vm-virtual-network-name> \
--subnet <subnet-name> \
--admin-username <admin-username> \
--admin-password <admin-password>
```


## Use an Express Route or VPN connection

To use an Express Route or VPN connection, see [About ExpressRoute virtual network gateways](/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-virtual-network-gateways).

## Use the AKS `command invoke`

feature

To use the AKS `command invoke`

feature to connect to a private cluster, see [Access a private cluster using command invoke](access-private-cluster).

# Use an internal load balancer with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can create and use an internal load balancer to restrict access to your applications in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). An internal load balancer doesn't have a public IP and makes a Kubernetes service accessible only to applications that can reach the private IP. These applications can be within the same virtual network or in another virtual network through virtual network peering. This article shows you how to create and use an internal load balancer with AKS.

Important

On September 30, 2025, Basic Load Balancer will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-basic-load-balancer-will-be-retired-on-30-september-2025-upgrade-to-standard-load-balancer/). There's no integrated option to use the Azure AKS API operation to migrate the Load Balancer SKU. The Load Balancer SKU decision must be done at cluster creation time. Therefore, if you're currently using Basic Load Balancer, take the necessary steps to migrate your workloads to a new created cluster with the new default Standard Load Balancer SKU prior to the retirement date.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you want to use an existing subnet or resource group, the AKS cluster identity needs permission to manage network resources. For information, see
[Configure Azure CNI networking in AKS](configure-azure-cni). If you're configuring your load balancer to use an[IP address in a different subnet](#specify-a-different-subnet), ensure the AKS cluster identity also has`Read`

access to that subnet.- For more information on permissions, see
[Delegate AKS access to other Azure resources](kubernetes-service-principal#delegate-access-to-other-azure-resources).

- For more information on permissions, see

## Create an internal load balancer

Create a service manifest named

`internal-lb.yaml`

with the service type`LoadBalancer`

and the`azure-load-balancer-internal`

annotation.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: internal-app annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: internal-app`

Deploy the internal load balancer using the

command. This command creates an Azure load balancer in the node resource group connected to the same virtual network as your AKS cluster.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f internal-lb.yaml`

View the service details using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service internal-app`

The IP address of the internal load balancer is shown in the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

column, as shown in the following example output. In this context,*External*refers to the external interface of the load balancer. It doesn't mean that it receives a public, external IP address. This IP address is dynamically assigned from the same subnet as the AKS cluster.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE internal-app LoadBalancer 10.0.248.59 10.240.0.7 80:30555/TCP 2m`


## Specify an IP address

When you specify an IP address for the load balancer, the specified IP address must reside in the same virtual network as the AKS cluster, but it can't already be assigned to another resource in the virtual network. For example, you shouldn't use an IP address in the range designated for the Kubernetes subnet within the AKS cluster. Using an IP address that's already assigned to another resource in the same virtual network can cause issues with the load balancer.

You can use the [ az network vnet subnet list](/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-list) Azure CLI command or the

[PowerShell cmdlet to get the subnets in your virtual network.](/en-us/powershell/module/az.network/get-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig)

`Get-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig`

For more information on subnets, see [Add a node pool with a unique subnet](node-pool-unique-subnet).

If you want to use a specific IP address with the load balancer, you have two options: **set service annotations** or **add the LoadBalancerIP property to the load balancer YAML manifest**.

Important

Adding the *LoadBalancerIP* property to the load balancer YAML manifest is deprecating following [upstream Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235). While current usage remains the same and existing services are expected to work without modification, we **highly recommend setting service annotations** instead. For more information about service annotations, see [Azure LoadBalancer supported annotations](https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/loadbalancer/#loadbalancer-annotations).

Set service annotations using

`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

for an IPv4 address and`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6`

for an IPv6 address.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: internal-app annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4: 10.240.0.25 service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: internal-app`


View the service details using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service internal-app`

The IP address in the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

column should reflect your specified IP address, as shown in the following example output:`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE internal-app LoadBalancer 10.0.184.168 10.240.0.25 80:30225/TCP 4m`


For more information on configuring your load balancer in a different subnet, see [Specify a different subnet](#specify-a-different-subnet).

## Connect Azure Private Link service to internal load balancer

### Before you begin

- You need Kubernetes version 1.22.x or later.
- You need an existing resource group with a virtual network and subnet. This resource group is where you
[create the private endpoint](#create-a-private-endpoint-to-the-private-link-service). If you don't have these resources, see[Create a virtual network and subnet](configure-kubenet#create-a-virtual-network-and-subnet).

### Create a Private Link service connection

Create a service manifest named

`internal-lb-pls.yaml`

with the service type`LoadBalancer`

and the`azure-load-balancer-internal`

and`azure-pls-create`

annotations. For more options, refer to the[Azure Private Link Service Integration](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/cloud-provider-azure/topics/pls-integration/)design document.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: internal-app annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true" service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-create: "true" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: internal-app`

Deploy the internal load balancer using the

command. This command creates an Azure load balancer in the node resource group connected to the same virtual network as your AKS cluster. It also creates a Private Link Service object that connects to the frontend IP configuration of the load balancer associated with the Kubernetes service.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f internal-lb-pls.yaml`

View the service details using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service internal-app`

The IP address of the internal load balancer is shown in the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

column, as shown in the following example output. In this context,*External*refers to the external interface of the load balancer. It doesn't mean that it receives a public, external IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE internal-app LoadBalancer 10.125.17.53 10.125.0.66 80:30430/TCP 64m`

View the details of the Private Link Service object using the

command.`az network private-link-service list`

`# Create a variable for the node resource group AKS_MC_RG=$(az aks show -g myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv) # View the details of the Private Link Service object az network private-link-service list -g $AKS_MC_RG --query "[].{Name:name,Alias:alias}" -o table`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`Name Alias -------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- pls-xyz pls-xyz.abc123-defg-4hij-56kl-789mnop.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice`


### Create a Private Endpoint to the Private Link service

A Private Endpoint allows you to privately connect to your Kubernetes service object via the Private Link Service you created.

Create the private endpoint using the

command.`az network private-endpoint create`

`# Create a variable for the private link service AKS_PLS_ID=$(az network private-link-service list -g $AKS_MC_RG --query "[].id" -o tsv) # Create the private endpoint $ az network private-endpoint create \ -g myOtherResourceGroup \ --name myAKSServicePE \ --vnet-name myOtherVNET \ --subnet pe-subnet \ --private-connection-resource-id $AKS_PLS_ID \ --connection-name connectToMyK8sService`


### PLS Customizations via Annotations

You can use the following annotations to customize the PLS resource:

| Annotation | Value | Description | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-create` |
`"true"` |
Boolean indicating whether a PLS needs to be created. | Required | |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-name` |
`<PLS name>` |
String specifying the name of the PLS resource to be created. | Optional | `"pls-<LB frontend config name>"` |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-resource-group` |
`Resource Group name` |
String specifying the name of the Resource Group where the PLS resource is created | Optional | `MC_ resource` |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-subnet` |
`<Subnet name>` |
String indicating the subnet to which the PLS is deployed. This subnet must exist in the same virtual network as the backend pool. PLS NAT IPs are allocated within this subnet. | Optional | If `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet` , this ILB subnet is used. Otherwise, the default subnet from config file is used. |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-ip-address-count` |
`[1-8]` |
Total number of private NAT IPs to allocate. | Optional | 1 |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-ip-address` |
`"10.0.0.7 ... 10.0.0.10"` |
A space separated list of static IPv4 IPs to be allocated. (IPv6 isn't supported right now.) Total number of IPs shouldn't be greater than the ip count specified in `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-ip-configuration-ip-address-count` . If there are fewer IPs specified, the rest are dynamically allocated. The first IP in the list is set as `Primary` . |
Optional | All IPs are dynamically allocated. |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-proxy-protocol` |
`"true"` or `"false"` |
Boolean indicating whether the TCP PROXY protocol should be enabled on the PLS to pass through connection information, including the link ID and source IP address. The backend service MUST support the PROXY protocol or the connections fails. | Optional | `false` |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-visibility` |
`"sub1 sub2 sub3 … subN"` or `"*"` |
A space separated list of Azure subscription IDs for which the private link service is visible. Use `"*"` to expose the PLS to all subs (Least restrictive). |
Optional | Empty list `[]` indicating role-based access control only: This private link service is only available to individuals with role-based access control permissions within your directory. (Most restrictive) |
`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pls-auto-approval` |
`"sub1 sub2 sub3 … subN"` |
A space separated list of Azure subscription IDs. This allows PE connection requests from the subscriptions listed to the PLS to be automatically approved. This only works when visibility is set to `"*"` . |
Optional | `[]` |

## Use private networks

When you create your AKS cluster, you can specify advanced networking settings. These settings allow you to deploy the cluster into an existing Azure virtual network and subnets. For example, you can deploy your AKS cluster into a private network connected to your on-premises environment and run services that are only accessible internally.

For more information, see [configure your own virtual network subnets with Kubenet](configure-kubenet) or [with Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni).

You don't need to make any changes to the previous steps to deploy an internal load balancer that uses a private network in an AKS cluster. The load balancer is created in the same resource group as your AKS cluster, but it's instead connected to your private virtual network and subnet, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl get service internal-app
NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
internal-app LoadBalancer 10.1.15.188 10.0.0.35 80:31669/TCP 1m
```


Note

The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must at least have the [Network Contributor](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#network-contributor) role on the virtual network resource. You can view the cluster identity using the [ az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show) command, such as

`az aks show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --query "identity"`

. You can assign the Network Contributor role using the [command, such as](/en-us/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create)

`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --assignee <identity-resource-id> --scope <virtual-network-resource-id> --role "Network Contributor"`

.If you want to define a [custom role](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles-cli) instead, you need the following permissions:

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`


For more information, see [Add, change, or delete a virtual network subnet](/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet).

### Specify a different subnet

Add the

`azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet`

annotation to your service to specify a subnet for your load balancer. The subnet specified must be in the same virtual network as your AKS cluster. When deployed, the load balancer`EXTERNAL-IP`

address is part of the specified subnet.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: internal-app annotations: service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true" service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal-subnet: "apps-subnet" spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: internal-app`


## Delete the load balancer

The load balancer is deleted when all of its services are deleted.

As with any Kubernetes resource, you can directly delete a service, such as `kubectl delete service internal-app`

, which also deletes the underlying Azure load balancer.

Visibility into system and performance metrics can indicate the limits of your underlying infrastructure and motivate real-time adjustments and optimizations to reduce workload interruptions. Monitoring also provides valuable insights into resource utilization for cost-effective management of computational resources and accurate provisioning.

The Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator (KAITO) is a managed add-on for AKS that simplifies deployment and operations for AI models in your AKS cluster.

In [KAITO version 0.4.4](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/releases/tag/v0.4.4) and later versions, the vLLM inference runtime is enabled by default in the AKS managed add-on. [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) is a library for language model inference and serving. It surfaces key system performance, resource usage, and request processing for [Prometheus metrics](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/design/v1/metrics.html) that you can use to evaluate your KAITO inference deployments.

In this article, you'll learn how to monitor and visualize vLLM inference metrics using the AI toolchain operator add-on with Azure Managed Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana on your AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one by using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Install and configure Azure CLI version 2.47.0 or later. To find your version, run
`az --version`

. To install or update, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Prerequisites

- Install and configure kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line client. For more information, see
[Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). - Enable the
[AI toolchain operator add-on](ai-toolchain-operator)in your AKS cluster. - If you already have the AI toolchain operator add-on enabled, update your AKS cluster to the latest version to run KAITO v0.4.4 or later.
- Enable
[the managed service for Prometheus and Azure Managed Grafana](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/kubernetes-monitoring-enable)in your AKS cluster. - Have permissions to
[create or update Azure Managed Grafana instances](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/how-to-manage-access-permissions-users-identities)in your Azure subscription.

## Deploy a KAITO inference service

In this example, you collect metrics for the [Qwen-2.5-coder-7B-instruct language model](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/blob/main/examples/inference/kaito_workspace_qwen_2.5_coder_7b-instruct.yaml).

Start by applying the following KAITO workspace custom resource to your cluster:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/kaito/main/examples/inference/kaito_workspace_qwen_2.5_coder_7b-instruct.yaml`

Track the live resource changes in your KAITO workspace:

`kubectl get workspace workspace-qwen-2-5-coder-7b-instruct -w`

Note

Machine readiness can take up to 10 minutes, and workspace readiness can take up to 20 minutes depending on the size of your language model.

Confirm that your inference service is running and get the service IP address:

`export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc workspace-qwen-2-5-coder-7b-instruct -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}') echo $SERVICE_IP`


## Surface KAITO inference metrics to the managed service for Prometheus

Prometheus metrics are collected by default at the KAITO [ /metrics endpoint](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/tree/main).

Add the following label to your KAITO inference service so that a Kubernetes

`ServiceMonitor`

deployment can detect it:`kubectl label svc workspace-qwen-2-5-coder-7b-instruct App=qwen-2-5-coder`

Create a

`ServiceMonitor`

resource to define the inference service endpoints and the required configurations to scrape the vLLM Prometheus metrics. Export these metrics to the managed service for Prometheus by deploying the following`ServiceMonitor`

YAML manifest in the`kube-system`

namespace:`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n kube-system -f - apiVersion: azmonitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: prometheus-kaito-monitor spec: selector: matchLabels: App: qwen-2-5-coder endpoints: - port: http interval: 30s path: /metrics scheme: http EOF`

Check for the following output to verify that

`ServiceMonitor`

is created:`servicemonitor.azmonitoring.coreos.com/prometheus-kaito-monitor created`

Verify that your

`ServiceMonitor`

deployment is running successfully:`kubectl get servicemonitor prometheus-kaito-monitor -n kube-system`

In the Azure portal, verify that vLLM metrics are successfully collected in the managed service for Prometheus.

In your Azure Monitor workspace, go to

**Managed Prometheus**>**Prometheus explorer**.Select the

**Grid**tab and confirm that a metrics item is associated with the job named`workspace-qwen-2-5-coder-7b-instruct`

.Note

The

`up`

value of this item should be`1`

. A value of`1`

indicates that Prometheus metrics are successfully being scraped from your AI inference service endpoint.


## Visualize KAITO inference metrics in Azure Managed Grafana

The vLLM project provides a Grafana dashboard configuration named

[grafana.json](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/online_serving/prometheus_grafana.html#example-materials)for inference workload monitoring. Navigate to the bottom of this[page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/online_serving/prometheus_grafana.html#example-materials)and copy the entire contents of the`grafana.json`

file.Go to the bottom of the

[examples page](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/examples/online_serving/prometheus_grafana.html#example-materials)and copy the entire contents of the`grafana.json`

file:Complete the steps to

[import the Grafana configurations into a new dashboard](/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/how-to-create-dashboard#import-a-json-dashboard)in Azure Managed Grafana.Go to your Managed Grafana endpoint, view the available dashboards, and select the

**vLLM**dashboard.To begin collecting data for your selected model deployment, confirm that the

**datasource**value shown at the top left of the Grafana dashboard is your instance of the managed service for Prometheus you created for this example.Copy the inference preset name defined in your KAITO workspace to the

**model_name**field in the Grafana dashboard. In this example, the model name is[qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/blob/main/examples/inference/kaito_workspace_qwen_2.5_coder_7b-instruct.yaml).In a few moments, verify that the metrics for your KAITO inference service appear in the vLLM Grafana dashboard.

Note

The value of these inference metrics remains

**0**until the requests are submitted to the model inference server.

# Create Windows Server node pools with containerd in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

For Kubernetes version 1.20 and higher, you can specify [ containerd](https://containerd.io/) as the container runtime for Windows Server 2019 node pools. Starting with Kubernetes 1.23,

`containerd`

is the default and only container runtime for Windows.In this article, you learn how to create Windows Server node pools with `containerd`

in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

[Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)installed and configured. Find the version using the`az version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).- An existing AKS cluster with a system node pool. If you need to create one, see
[Create an AKS cluster with a single node pool](create-node-pools#create-an-aks-cluster-with-a-single-node-pool-using-the-azure-cli).

## Limitations and considerations

When using Windows Server node pools with `containerd`

, keep the following limitations and considerations in mind:

- Both the control plane and Windows Server 2019 node pools must use Kubernetes version 1.20 or greater.
- When you create or update a node pool to run Windows Server containers, the default value for
`--node-vm-size`

is`Standard_D2s_v3`

, which was the minimum recommended size for Windows Server 2019 node pools up to Kubernetes version 1.20. The minimum recommended size for Windows Server 2019 node pools using`containerd`

is`Standard_D4s_v3`

. When setting the`--node-vm-size`

parameter, check the[list of restricted virtual machine (VM) sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview). - We recommend using
[taints or labels](manage-node-pools#set-node-pool-taints)with your Windows Server 2019 node pools running`containerd`

and tolerations or node selectors with your deployments to guarantee your workloads are scheduled correctly.

## Add a Windows Server node pool with `containerd`


Add a Windows Server node pool with

`containerd`

into your existing cluster using the [`az aks nodepool add`

][az-aks-nodepool-add].Note

If you don't specify the

`WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`

custom header, the node pool still uses`containerd`

as the container runtime by default.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --os-type Windows \ --name $CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-vm-size Standard_D4s_v3 \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.5 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd \ --node-count 1`


## Upgrade an existing Windows Server node pool to `containerd`


Upgrade a specific node pool from Docker to

`containerd`

using the [`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`export CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME="mywindowsnodepool" az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --name $CONTAINER_D_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.7 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`


## Upgrade all existing Windows Server node pools to `containerd`


Upgrade all node pools from Docker to

`containerd`

using the [`az aks nodepool upgrade`

][az-aks-nodepool-upgrade] command.`az aks nodepool upgrade \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --kubernetes-version 1.20.7 \ --aks-custom-headers WindowsContainerRuntime=containerd`

# Delete an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pool

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article outlines node pool deletion in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including what happens when you delete a node pool and how to delete a node pool.

## What happens when you delete a node pool?

When you delete a node pool, the following resources are deleted:

- The virtual machine scale set (VMSS) and virtual machines (VMs) for each node in the node pool
- Any node instances in the node pool along with any pods running on those nodes

## Delete a node pool

Important

Keep the following information in mind when deleting a node pool:

**You can't recover a node pool after it's deleted**. You need to create a new node pool and redeploy your applications.

Delete a node pool using the [ az aks nodepool delete](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-nodepool-delete) command.

```
az aks nodepool delete \
--resource-group <resource-group-name> \
--cluster-name <cluster-name> \
--name <node-pool-name>
```


To verify that the node pool was deleted successfully, use the `kubectl get nodes`

command to confirm that the nodes in the node pool no longer exist.

## Ignore PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs) when removing an existing node pool

If your cluster has PodDisruptionBudgets that are preventing the deletion of the node pool, you can ignore the PodDisruptionBudget requirements by setting `--ignore-pod-disruption-budget`

to `true`

. To learn more about PodDisruptionBudgets, see:

[Plan for availability using a pod disruption budget](operator-best-practices-scheduler#plan-for-availability-using-pod-disruption-budgets)[Specifying a Disruption Budget for your Application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/)[Disruptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/)

Delete an existing node pool without following any PodDisruptionBudgets set on the cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool delete`

`--ignore-pod-disruption-budget`

flag set to`true`

:`az aks nodepool delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --ignore-pod-disruption-budget true`

To verify that the node pool was deleted successfully, use the

`kubectl get nodes`

command to confirm that the nodes in the node pool no longer exist.

## Remove specific VMs in an existing node pool

Note

When you delete a VM with this command, AKS doesn't perform cordon and drain. To minimize the disruption of rescheduling pods currently running on the VM you plan to delete, perform a cordon and drain on the VM before deleting. You can learn more about how to cordon and drain using the example scenario provided in the resizing node pools tutorial.

List the existing nodes using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-mynodepool-20823458-vmss000000 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-20823458-vmss000001 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9 aks-mynodepool-20823458-vmss000002 Ready agent 63m v1.21.9`

Delete the specified VMs using the

command. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your own values.`az aks nodepool delete-machines`

`az aks nodepool delete-machines \ --resource-group <resource-group-name> \ --cluster-name <cluster-name> \ --name <node-pool-name> \ --machine-names <vm-name-1> <vm-name-2>`

Verify the VMs were successfully deleted using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes`

Your output should no longer include the VMs that you specified in the

`az aks nodepool delete-machines`

command.

## Next steps

# Reduce image pull time with Artifact Streaming on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

High performance compute workloads often involve large images, which can cause long image pull times and slow down your workload deployments. Artifact Streaming on AKS allows you to stream container images from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to AKS. AKS only pulls the necessary layers for initial pod startup, reducing the time it takes to pull images and deploy your workloads.

Artifact Streaming can reduce time to pod readiness by over 15%, depending on the size of the image, and it works best for images <30GB. Based on our testing, we saw reductions in pod start-up times for images <10GB from minutes to seconds. If you have a pod that needs access to a large file (>30GB), then you should mount it as a volume instead of building it as a layer. This is because if your pod requires that file to start, it congests the node. Artifact Streaming isn't ideal for read heavy images from your filesystem if you need that on startup. With Artifact Streaming, pod start-up becomes concurrent, whereas without it, pods start in serial.

This article describes how to enable the Artifact Streaming feature on your AKS node pools to stream artifacts from ACR.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

Important

Artifact Streaming (preview) is a suggested alternative for customers previously using Teleport (preview).
[Teleport (preview)](https://github.com/Azure/acr/blob/main/docs/teleport/aks-getting-started.md) on AKS will be retired on 15 July 2025. Please migrate to Artifact Streaming (preview) on AKS or update your node pools to set `--aks-custom-headers EnableACRTeleport=false`

.
Azure Container Registry removed the Teleport API, meaning that any nodes with Teleport enabled will pull images from Azure Container Registry like any other AKS node without Teleport.
After 15 July 2025, AKS node pools with Teleport enabled might experience breakage and node provisioning failures. For more information, see [aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement](https://aka.ms/aks/teleport-retirement).

## Limitations

- Artifact Steaming isn't supported for the following OS options:
[Windows Server versions](windows-best-practices),[Flatcar Container Linux for AKS](flatcar-container-linux-for-aks), and[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Prerequisites

- You need an existing AKS cluster with ACR integration. If you don't have one, you can create one using
[Authenticate with ACR from AKS](cluster-container-registry-integration). [Enable Artifact Streaming on ACR](#enable-artifact-streaming-on-acr).- This feature requires Kubernetes version 1.25 or later. To check your AKS cluster version, see
[Check for available AKS cluster upgrades](upgrade-cluster).

Note

Artifact Streaming is only supported on Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 20.04, and Azure Linux node pools. Windows node pools aren't supported.

## Install the `aks-preview`

CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update the extension to ensure you have the latest version installed using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


## Register the `ArtifactStreamingPreview`

feature flag in your subscription

Register the

`ArtifactStreamingPreview`

feature flag in your subscription using thecommand.`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name ArtifactStreamingPreview`


## Enable Artifact Streaming on ACR

Enablement on ACR is a prerequisite for Artifact Streaming on AKS. For more information, see [Artifact Streaming on ACR](https://aka.ms/acr/artifact-streaming).

Create an Azure resource group to hold your ACR instance using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myStreamingTest --location westus`

Create a new premium SKU Azure Container Registry using the

command with the`az acr create`

`--sku Premium`

flag.`az acr create --resource-group myStreamingTest --name mystreamingtest --sku Premium`

Configure the default ACR instance for your subscription using the

command.`az configure`

`az configure --defaults acr="mystreamingtest"`

Push or import an image to the registry using the

command.`az acr import`

`az acr import --source docker.io/jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest --repository jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`

Create a streaming artifact from the image using the

command.`az acr artifact-streaming create`

`az acr artifact-streaming create --image jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`

Verify the generated Artifact Streaming using the

command.`az acr manifest list-referrers`

`az acr manifest list-referrers --name jupyter/all-spark-notebook:latest`


## Enable Artifact Streaming on AKS

### Enable Artifact Streaming on a new node pool

Create a new node pool with Artifact Streaming enabled using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--enable-artifact-streaming`

.`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myNodePool \ --enable-artifact-streaming`


### Enable Artifact Streaming on an existing node pool

Update an existing node pool to enable Artifact Streaming using the

command with the`az aks nodepool update`

`--enable-artifact-streaming`

.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myNodePool \ --enable-artifact-streaming`


## Check if Artifact Streaming is enabled

Now that you enabled Artifact Streaming on a premium ACR and connected that to an AKS node pool with Artifact Streaming enabled, any new pod deployments on this cluster with an image pull from the ACR with Artifact Streaming enabled will see reductions in image pull times.

Check if your node pool has Artifact Streaming enabled using the

command.`az aks nodepool show`

`az aks nodepool show --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name myNodePool --query artifactStreamingProfile`

In the output, check that the

`Enabled`

field is set to`true`

.

## Next steps

This article described how to enable Artifact Streaming on your AKS node pools to stream artifacts from ACR and reduce image pull time.

# Quickstart: Deploy an application using the Dapr cluster extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Arc-enabled Kubernetes

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this quickstart, you use the [Dapr cluster extension](dapr-overview) in an AKS or Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster. You deploy [a hello world example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dapr-aks-extension-quickstart), which consists of a Python application that generates messages and a Node.js application that consumes and persists the messages.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). [Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)or[Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)installed.- An AKS Cluster with:
[Workload identity](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#deploy-and-configure-microsoft-entra-workload-id-on-an-azure-kubernetes-service-aks-cluster)enabled[Managed identity](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-a-managed-identity)created in the same subscription[A Kubernetes service account](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-service-account)[Federated identity credential](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-the-federated-identity-credential)[Dapr cluster extension](dapr-overview)installed on the AKS cluster

[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)installed locally.

## Clone the repository

Clone the

[Dapr quickstarts repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dapr-aks-extension-quickstart)using the`git clone`

command.`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dapr-aks-extension-quickstart.git`

Change to the

`dapr-aks-extension-quickstart`

directory.

## Create and configure a Redis store

Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Cache) to start the Azure Cache for Redis creation flow.

- Fill out the recommended information according to
[the "Create an open-source Redis cache" quickstart instructions](/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/quickstart-create-redis). - Select
**Create**to start the Redis instance deployment.

### Verify resource information

- Once the Redis resource is deployed, navigate to its overview page.
- Take note of:
- The hostname, found in the
**Essentials**section of the cache overview page. The hostname format looks similar to:`xxxxxx.redis.cache.windows.net`

. - The SSL port, found in the cache's
**Advanced Settings**blade. The default value is`6380`

.

- The hostname, found in the
- Navigate to the
**Authentication**blade and verify Microsoft Entra Authentication is enabled on your resource.

### Add managed identity

In the

**Authentication**blade, type the name of the[Managed Identity you created as a prerequisite](#prerequisites)in the field under**Enable Microsoft Entra Authentication**checkbox.Verify your managed identity is added as a Redis User assigned Data Owner Access Policy permissions.


### Enable public network access

For this scenario, your Redis cache uses public network access. Be sure to [clean up resources](#clean-up-resources) when you're finished with this quickstart.

- Navigate to the
**Private Endpoint**blade. - Click
**Enable public network access**from the top menu.

## Configure the Dapr components

In `redis.yaml`

, the component is configured to use Entra ID Authentication using workload identity enabled for AKS cluster. No access keys are required.

```
- name: useEntraID
value: "true"
- name: enableTLS
value: true
```


In your preferred code editor, navigate to the

`deploy`

directory in the sample and open`redis.yaml`

.For

`redisHost`

, replace the placeholder`<REDIS_HOST>:<REDIS_PORT>`

value with the Redis cache hostname and SSL port[you saved earlier from Azure portal](#verify-resource-information).`- name: redisHost value: <your-cache-name>.redis.cache.windows.net:6380`


### Apply the configuration

Apply the

`redis.yaml`

file using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f ./deploy/redis.yaml`

Verify your state store was successfully configured using the

`kubectl get components.redis`

command.`kubectl get components.redis -o yaml`

**Expected output**`component.dapr.io/statestore created`


## Deploy the Node.js app with the Dapr sidecar

### Configure the Node.js app

In `node.yaml`

, the pod spec has the label added to use workload identity:

```
labels:
app: node
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
```


Navigate to the

`deploy`

directory and open`node.yaml`

.Replace the placeholder

`<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>`

value for`serviceAccountName`

with[the service account name you created](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-service-account).- This value should be the same service account you used to create the federated identity credential.


### Apply the configuration

Apply the Node.js app deployment to your cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f ./deploy/node.yaml`

Kubernetes deployments are asynchronous, so before moving on to the next steps, verify the deployment is complete with the following command:

`kubectl rollout status deploy/nodeapp`

Access your service using the

`kubectl get svc`

command.`kubectl get svc nodeapp`

Make note of the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

in the output.

### Verify the Node.js service

Using

`curl`

, call the service with your`EXTERNAL-IP`

.`curl $EXTERNAL_IP/ports`

**Example output**`{"DAPR_HTTP_PORT":"3500","DAPR_GRPC_PORT":"50001"}`

Submit an order to the application.

`curl --request POST --data "@sample.json" --header Content-Type:application/json $EXTERNAL_IP/neworder`

Confirm the order.

`curl $EXTERNAL_IP/order`

**Expected output**`{ "orderId": "42" }`


## Deploy the Python app with the Dapr sidecar

### Configure the Python app

In `python.yaml`

, the pod spec has the label added to use workload identity:

```
labels:
app: node
azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
```


Navigate to the

`deploy`

directory and open`python.yaml`

.Replace the placeholder

`<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>`

value for`serviceAccountName`

with[the service account name you created](workload-identity-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-service-account).- This value should be the same service account you used to create the federated identity credential.


### Apply the configuration

Deploy the Python app to your Kubernetes cluster using the

`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f ./deploy/python.yaml`

Kubernetes deployments are asynchronous, so before moving on to the next steps, verify the deployment is complete with the following command:

`kubectl rollout status deploy/pythonapp`


## Observe messages and confirm persistence

Now that both the Node.js and Python applications are deployed, you can watch messages come through.

Get the logs of the Node.js app using the

`kubectl logs`

command.`kubectl logs --selector=app=node -c node --tail=-1`

**Expected output**`Got a new order! Order ID: 1 Successfully persisted state Got a new order! Order ID: 2 Successfully persisted state Got a new order! Order ID: 3 Successfully persisted state`

Using

`curl`

, call the Node.js app's order endpoint to get the latest order.`curl $EXTERNAL_IP/order`

You should see the latest JSON output in the response.


## Clean up resources

If you no longer plan to use the resources from this quickstart, you can delete all associated resources by removing the resource group.

Remove the resource group, cluster, namespace, and all related resources using the [az group delete](/en-us/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command.

```
az group delete --name MyResourceGroup
```

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Deploy external or internal Istio Ingress](istio-deploy-ingress) article describes how to configure an ingress gateway to expose an HTTP service to external/internal traffic. This article shows how to expose a secure HTTPS service using either simple or mutual TLS.

## Prerequisites

Enable the Istio add-on on the cluster as per

[documentation](istio-deploy-addon)Deploy an external Istio ingress gateway as per

[documentation](istio-deploy-ingress)

Note

This article refers to the external ingress gateway for demonstration, same steps would apply for configuring mutual TLS for internal ingress gateway.

## Required client/server certificates and keys

This article requires several certificates and keys. You can use your favorite tool to create them or you can use the following [openssl](https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1) commands.

Create a root certificate and private key for signing the certificates for sample services:

`mkdir bookinfo_certs openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj '/O=bookinfo Inc./CN=bookinfo.com' -keyout bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.key -out bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt`

Generate a certificate and private key for

`productpage.bookinfo.com`

:`openssl req -out bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.key -subj "/CN=productpage.bookinfo.com/O=product organization" openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -CA bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt -CAkey bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.key -set_serial 0 -in bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.csr -out bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.crt`

Generate a client certificate and private key:

`openssl req -out bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.key -subj "/CN=client.bookinfo.com/O=client organization" openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -CA bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt -CAkey bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.key -set_serial 1 -in bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.csr -out bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.crt`


## Configure a TLS ingress gateway

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret for the ingress gateway; use [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) to host certificates/keys and [Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider add-on](csi-secrets-store-driver) to sync secrets to the cluster.

### Set up Azure Key Vault and sync secrets to the cluster

Create Azure Key Vault

You need an

[Azure Key Vault resource](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-cli)to supply the certificate and key inputs to the Istio add-on.`export AKV_NAME=<azure-key-vault-resource-name> az keyvault create --name $AKV_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Enable

[Azure Key Vault provider for Secret Store CSI Driver](csi-secrets-store-driver)add-on on your cluster.`az aks enable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

If your Key Vault is using Azure RBAC for the permissions model, follow the instructions

[here](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide#using-azure-rbac-secret-key-and-certificate-permissions-with-key-vault)to assign an Azure role of Key Vault Secrets User for the add-on's user-assigned managed identity. Alternatively, if your key vault is using the vault access policy permissions model, authorize the user-assigned managed identity of the add-on to access Azure Key Vault resource using access policy:`OBJECT_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --query 'addonProfiles.azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider.identity.objectId' -o tsv | tr -d '\r') CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --query 'addonProfiles.azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider.identity.clientId') TENANT_ID=$(az keyvault show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKV_NAME --query 'properties.tenantId') az keyvault set-policy --name $AKV_NAME --object-id $OBJECT_ID --secret-permissions get list`

Create secrets in Azure Key Vault using the certificates and keys.

`az keyvault secret set --vault-name $AKV_NAME --name test-productpage-bookinfo-key --file bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.key az keyvault secret set --vault-name $AKV_NAME --name test-productpage-bookinfo-crt --file bookinfo_certs/productpage.bookinfo.com.crt az keyvault secret set --vault-name $AKV_NAME --name test-bookinfo-crt --file bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt`

Use the following manifest to deploy SecretProviderClass to provide Azure Key Vault specific parameters to the CSI driver.

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1 kind: SecretProviderClass metadata: name: productpage-credential-spc namespace: aks-istio-ingress spec: provider: azure secretObjects: - secretName: productpage-credential type: kubernetes.io/tls data: - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-key key: tls.key - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-crt key: tls.crt parameters: useVMManagedIdentity: "true" userAssignedIdentityID: $CLIENT_ID keyvaultName: $AKV_NAME cloudName: "" objects: | array: - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-key objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-key" - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-crt objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-crt" tenantId: $TENANT_ID EOF`

Alternatively, to reference a certificate object type directly from Azure Key Vault, use the following manifest to deploy SecretProviderClass. In this example,

`test-productpage-bookinfo-cert-pxf`

is the name of the certificate object in Azure Key Vault. Refer to[obtain certificates and keys](csi-secrets-store-identity-access?pivots=access-with-a-user-assigned-managed-identity#obtain-certificates-and-keys)section for more information.`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1 kind: SecretProviderClass metadata: name: productpage-credential-spc namespace: aks-istio-ingress spec: provider: azure secretObjects: - secretName: productpage-credential type: kubernetes.io/tls data: - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-key key: tls.key - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-crt key: tls.crt parameters: useVMManagedIdentity: "true" userAssignedIdentityID: $CLIENT_ID keyvaultName: $AKV_NAME cloudName: "" objects: | array: - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-cert-pfx #certificate object name from keyvault objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-key" - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-cert-pfx #certificate object name from keyvault objectType: cert objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-crt" tenantId: $TENANT_ID EOF`

Use the following manifest to deploy a sample pod. The secret store CSI driver requires a pod to reference the SecretProviderClass resource to ensure secrets sync from Azure Key Vault to the cluster.

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secrets-store-sync-productpage namespace: aks-istio-ingress spec: containers: - name: busybox image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/busybox/busybox:1.33.1 command: - "/bin/sleep" - "10" volumeMounts: - name: secrets-store01-inline mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store" readOnly: true volumes: - name: secrets-store01-inline csi: driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io readOnly: true volumeAttributes: secretProviderClass: "productpage-credential-spc" EOF`

Verify

`productpage-credential`

secret created on the cluster namespace`aks-istio-ingress`

as defined in the SecretProviderClass resource.`kubectl describe secret/productpage-credential -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`Name: productpage-credential Namespace: aks-istio-ingress Labels: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io/managed=true Annotations: <none> Type: tls Data ==== cert: 1066 bytes key: 1704 bytes`


### Configure ingress gateway and virtual service

Route HTTPS traffic via the Istio ingress gateway to the sample applications. Use the following manifest to deploy gateway and virtual service resources.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
selector:
istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-external
servers:
- port:
number: 443
name: https
protocol: HTTPS
tls:
mode: SIMPLE
credentialName: productpage-credential
hosts:
- productpage.bookinfo.com
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: productpage-vs
spec:
hosts:
- productpage.bookinfo.com
gateways:
- bookinfo-gateway
http:
- match:
- uri:
exact: /productpage
- uri:
prefix: /static
- uri:
exact: /login
- uri:
exact: /logout
- uri:
prefix: /api/v1/products
route:
- destination:
port:
number: 9080
host: productpage
EOF
```


Note

In the gateway definition, `credentialName`

must match the `secretName`

in SecretProviderClass resource and `selector`

must refer to the external ingress gateway by its label, in which the key of the label is `istio`

and the value is `aks-istio-ingressgateway-external`

. For internal ingress gateway label is `istio`

and the value is `aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal`

.

Set environment variables for external ingress host and ports:

```
export INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL=$(kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].port}')
export SECURE_GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL=$INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL
echo "https://$SECURE_GATEWAY_URL_EXTERNAL/productpage"
```


### Verification

Send an HTTPS request to access the productpage service through HTTPS:

```
curl -s -HHost:productpage.bookinfo.com --resolve "productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL:$INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL" --cacert bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt "https://productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```


Confirm that the sample application's product page is accessible. The expected output is:

```
<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
```


Note

To configure HTTPS ingress access to an HTTPS service, i.e., configure an ingress gateway to perform SNI passthrough instead of TLS termination on incoming requests, update the tls mode in the gateway definition to `PASSTHROUGH`

. This instructs the gateway to pass the ingress traffic “as is”, without terminating TLS.

## Configure a mutual TLS ingress gateway

Extend your gateway definition to support mutual TLS.

Update the ingress gateway credential by deleting the current secret and creating a new one. The server uses the CA certificate to verify its clients, and we must use the key ca.crt to hold the CA certificate.

`kubectl delete secretproviderclass productpage-credential-spc -n aks-istio-ingress kubectl delete secret/productpage-credential -n aks-istio-ingress kubectl delete pod/secrets-store-sync-productpage -n aks-istio-ingress`

Use the following manifest to recreate SecretProviderClass with CA certificate.

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1 kind: SecretProviderClass metadata: name: productpage-credential-spc namespace: aks-istio-ingress spec: provider: azure secretObjects: - secretName: productpage-credential type: opaque data: - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-key key: tls.key - objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-crt key: tls.crt - objectName: test-bookinfo-crt key: ca.crt parameters: useVMManagedIdentity: "true" userAssignedIdentityID: $CLIENT_ID keyvaultName: $AKV_NAME cloudName: "" objects: | array: - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-key objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-key" - | objectName: test-productpage-bookinfo-crt objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-productpage-bookinfo-crt" - | objectName: test-bookinfo-crt objectType: secret objectAlias: "test-bookinfo-crt" tenantId: $TENANT_ID EOF`

Use the following manifest to redeploy sample pod to sync secrets from Azure Key Vault to the cluster.

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: secrets-store-sync-productpage namespace: aks-istio-ingress spec: containers: - name: busybox image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/busybox:1.29-4 command: - "/bin/sleep" - "10" volumeMounts: - name: secrets-store01-inline mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store" readOnly: true volumes: - name: secrets-store01-inline csi: driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io readOnly: true volumeAttributes: secretProviderClass: "productpage-credential-spc" EOF`

Verify

`productpage-credential`

secret created on the cluster namespace`aks-istio-ingress`

.`kubectl describe secret/productpage-credential -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`Name: productpage-credential Namespace: aks-istio-ingress Labels: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io/managed=true Annotations: <none> Type: opaque Data ==== ca.crt: 1188 bytes tls.crt: 1066 bytes tls.key: 1704 bytes`


Use the following manifest to update the gateway definition to set the TLS mode to MUTUAL.

`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1 kind: Gateway metadata: name: bookinfo-gateway spec: selector: istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-external # use istio default ingress gateway servers: - port: number: 443 name: https protocol: HTTPS tls: mode: MUTUAL credentialName: productpage-credential # must be the same as secret hosts: - productpage.bookinfo.com EOF`


### Verification

Attempt to send HTTPS request using the prior approach - without passing the client certificate - and see it fail.

```
curl -v -HHost:productpage.bookinfo.com --resolve "productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL:$INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL" --cacert bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt "https://productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL/productpage"
```


Example output:

```
...
* TLSv1.2 (IN), TLS header, Supplemental data (23):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS alert, unknown (628):
* OpenSSL SSL_read: error:0A00045C:SSL routines::tlsv13 alert certificate required, errno 0
* Failed receiving HTTP2 data
* OpenSSL SSL_write: SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN, errno 0
* Failed sending HTTP2 data
* Connection #0 to host productpage.bookinfo.com left intact
curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: error:0A00045C:SSL routines::tlsv13 alert certificate required, errno 0
```


Pass your client’s certificate with the `--cert`

flag and private key with the `--key`

flag to curl.

```
curl -s -HHost:productpage.bookinfo.com --resolve "productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL:$INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL" --cacert bookinfo_certs/bookinfo.com.crt --cert bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.crt --key bookinfo_certs/client.bookinfo.com.key "https://productpage.bookinfo.com:$SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"
```


Confirm that the sample application's product page is accessible. The expected output is:

```
<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
```


## Delete resources

If you want to clean up the Istio service mesh and the ingresses (leaving behind the cluster), run the following command:

```
az aks mesh disable --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER}
```


If you want to clean up all the resources created from the Istio how-to guidance documents, run the following command:

```
az group delete --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --yes --no-wait
```

# Secure access to the API server using authorized IP address ranges in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use API server authorized IP address ranges to limit which IP addresses and CIDRs can access control plane endpoints for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads.

## Prerequisites

- The Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later installed and configured. Check your version using the
`az --version`

command. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - To learn what IP addresses to include when integrating your AKS cluster with Azure DevOps, see
[Allowed IP addresses and domain URLs](/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url).

Tip

From the Azure portal, you can use Azure Copilot to make changes to the IP addresses that can access your cluster. For more information, see [Work with AKS clusters efficiently using Azure Copilot](/en-us/azure/copilot/work-aks-clusters#enable-ip-address-authorization).

## Limitations and considerations

- This feature is only supported on the Standard SKU load balancer for clusters created after October 2019. Any existing clusters on the Basic SKU load balancer with the feature enabled should continue to work properly if the Kubernetes version and control plane are upgraded. However, you can't migrate these clusters to the Standard SKU load balancer.
- You can't use this feature with
[private clusters](private-clusters). - When using this feature with clusters that use
[Node public IPs](use-node-public-ips), the node pools using the Node public IPs must use public IP prefixes. You must add the public IP prefixes as authorized ranges. - You can specify up to 200 authorized IP ranges. To go beyond this limit, consider using
[API Server VNet Integration](api-server-vnet-integration), which supports up to 2,000 authorized IP ranges.

## Overview of API server authorized IP ranges

The Kubernetes API server exposes underlying Kubernetes APIs and provides the interaction for management tools like `kubectl`

and the Kubernetes dashboard. AKS provides a single-tenant cluster control plane with a dedicated API server. The API server is assigned a public IP address by default. You can control access using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) or Azure RBAC.

To secure access to the otherwise publicly accessible AKS control plane / API server, you can enable and use authorized IP ranges. These authorized IP ranges only allow defined IP address ranges to communicate with the API server. Any requests made to the API server from an IP address that isn't part of these authorized IP ranges is blocked. The rules can take up to two minutes to propagate. Allow up to that time when testing the connection.

## Recommended IP ranges to allow

We recommend including the following IP address ranges in your API server authorized IP ranges configuration:

- The cluster egress IP address (firewall, NAT gateway, or other address, depending on your
[outbound type](egress-outboundtype)). - Any range that represents networks that you'll administer the cluster from.

## Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled

Note

When you enable API server authorized IP ranges during cluster creation, both the API server public IP and the outbound public IP of the [Standard SKU load balancer](load-balancer-standard) are automatically allowed by default, in addition to any ranges you specify.

**Special case - 0.0.0.0/32**: This is a special value that tells AKS to allow only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer to access the API server. The

`0.0.0.0/32`

value acts as a placeholder that:- Disables the default behavior of allowing extra client IP ranges.
- Restricts API server access to only the cluster's own outbound IP.
- Is useful for scenarios where you want the cluster to self-manage but block external access.

When creating a cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled, you provide a list of authorized public IP address ranges. When you specify a CIDR range, you must use the network address (first IP address in the range). For example, if you want to allow the range `137.117.106.88`

to `137.117.106.95`

, you must specify `137.117.106.88/29`

.

Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*and allows the IP address range`73.140.245.0/24`

to access the API server:`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets --load-balancer-sku standard --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 73.140.245.0/24 --generate-ssh-keys`


Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled using the

cmdlet with the`New-AzAksCluster`

`-ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange`

parameter. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*and allows the IP address range`73.140.245.0/24`

to access the API server:`New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -NodeVmSetType VirtualMachineScaleSets -LoadBalancerSku Standard -ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange '73.140.245.0/24' -GenerateSshKey`


- From the
[Azure portal home page](https://portal.azure.com/#home), select**Create a resource**>**Containers**>**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. - Configure the cluster settings as needed.
- In the
**Networking**section under**Public access**, select**Set authorized IP ranges**. - For
**Specify IP ranges**, enter the IP address ranges you want to authorize to access the API server. - Configure the rest of the cluster settings as needed.
- When you're ready, select
**Review + create**>**Create**to create the cluster.

## Specify outbound IPs for a Standard SKU load balancer

When creating a cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled, you can also specify the outbound IP addresses or prefixes for the cluster using the `--load-balancer-outbound-ips`

or `--load-balancer-outbound-ip-prefixes`

parameters. All IPs provided in the parameters are allowed along with the IPs in the `--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter.

Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled and specify the outbound IP addresses for the Standard SKU load balancer using the

`--load-balancer-outbound-ips`

parameter. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*, allows the IP address range`73.140.245.0/24`

to access the API server, and specifies two outbound IP addresses for the Standard SKU load balancer. Make sure to replace the placeholders`<public-ip-id-1>`

and`<public-ip-id-2>`

with the actual resource IDs of your public IP addresses.`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets --load-balancer-sku standard --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 73.140.245.0/24 --load-balancer-outbound-ips <public-ip-id-1>,<public-ip-id-2> --generate-ssh-keys`


## Allow only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer

Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled and allow only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer using the

`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*with API server authorized IP ranges enabled and allows only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer:`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets --load-balancer-sku standard --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 0.0.0.0/32 --generate-ssh-keys`


Create an AKS cluster with API server authorized IP ranges enabled and allow only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer using the

`-ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange`

parameter. The following example creates a cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*with API server authorized IP ranges enabled and allows only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer:`New-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -NodeVmSetType VirtualMachineScaleSets -LoadBalancerSku Standard -ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange '0.0.0.0/32' -GenerateSshKey`


- From the
[Azure portal home page](https://portal.azure.com/#home), select**Create a resource**>**Containers**>**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. - Configure the cluster settings as needed.
- In the
**Networking**section under**Public access**, select**Set authorized IP ranges**. - For
**Specify IP ranges**, enter`0.0.0.0/32`

. This setting allows only the outbound public IP of the Standard SKU load balancer. - Configure the rest of the cluster settings as needed.
- When you're ready, select
**Review + create**>**Create**to create the cluster.

## Update the API server authorized IP ranges on an existing cluster

Update an existing cluster's API server authorized IP ranges using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter. The following example updates API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*and updates the IP address range to`73.140.245.0/24`

:`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 73.140.245.0/24`


## Allow multiple IP address ranges

To allow multiple IP address ranges, you can list several IP addresses, separated by commas.

Update an existing cluster's API server authorized IP ranges to allow multiple IP address ranges using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter. The following example updates API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*and allows multiple IP address ranges:`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges 73.140.245.0/24,193.168.1.0/24,194.168.1.0/24`


Update an existing cluster's API server authorized IP ranges using the

cmdlet with the`Set-AzAksCluster`

`-ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange`

parameter. The following example updates API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*and updates the IP address range to`73.140.245.0/24`

:`Set-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange '73.140.245.0/24'`


- Navigate to the Azure portal and select the AKS cluster you want to update.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Networking**. - Under
**Resource settings**, select**Manage**. - On the
**Authorized IP ranges**page, update the**Authorized IP ranges**as needed. - When you're done, select
**Save**.

## Disable API server authorized IP ranges on an existing cluster

Disable API server authorized IP ranges using the

command and specify an empty range`az aks update`

`""`

for the`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter.`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges ""`


Disable API server authorized IP ranges using the

cmdlet and specify an empty range`Set-AzAksCluster`

`''`

for the`-ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange`

parameter.`Set-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange ''`


- Navigate to the Azure portal and select the AKS cluster you want to update.
- From the service menu, under
**Settings**, select**Networking**. - Under
**Resource settings**, select**Manage**. - On the
**Authorized IP ranges**page, deselect the**Set authorized IP ranges**checkbox. - Select
**Save**.

## Find existing API server authorized IP ranges

Find existing API server authorized IP ranges using the

command with the`az aks show`

`--query`

parameter set to`apiServerAccessProfile.authorizedIpRanges`

.`az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --query apiServerAccessProfile.authorizedIpRanges`

Example output:

`[ "73.140.245.0/24" ]`


Find existing API server authorized IP ranges using the

cmdlet.`Get-AzAksCluster`

`Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ApiServerAccessProfile`

Example output:

`AuthorizedIPRanges: {73.140.245.0/24} ...`


Navigate to the Azure portal and select your AKS cluster.

From the service menu, under

**Settings**, select**Networking**. The existing API server authorized IP ranges are listed under**Resource settings**.

## Access the API server from your development machine, tooling, or automation

You must add your development machines, tooling, or automation IP addresses to the AKS cluster list of approved IP ranges to access the API server from there.

Another option is to configure a jumpbox with the necessary tooling inside a separate subnet in the firewall's virtual network. This option assumes your environment has a firewall with the respective network and that you added the firewall IPs to authorized ranges. Similarly, if you forced tunneling from the AKS subnet to the firewall subnet, having the jumpbox in the cluster subnet also works.

Note

The following example adds another IP address to the approved ranges. It still includes the existing IP address. If you don't include your existing IP address, this command replaces it with the new one instead of adding it to the authorized ranges.

Retrieve your IP address and set it to an environment variable using the following command:

`# Retrieve your IP address CURRENT_IP=$(dig +short "myip.opendns.com" "@resolver1.opendns.com")`

Add your IP address to the approved list using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges`

parameter. The following example adds your current IP address to the existing API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*:`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --api-server-authorized-ip-ranges $CURRENT_IP/24,73.140.245.0/24`


Retrieve your IP address and set it to an environment variable using the following command:

`# Retrieve your IP address CURRENT_IP=$(dig +short "myip.opendns.com" "@resolver1.opendns.com")`

Add your IP address to the approved list using the

cmdlet with the`Set-AzAksCluster`

`-ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange`

parameter. The following example adds your current IP address to the existing API server authorized IP ranges on the cluster named*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*:`Set-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -ApiServerAccessAuthorizedIpRange '$CURRENT_IP/24,73.140.245.0/24'`


Another option is to use the following command on Windows systems to get the public IPv4 address:

```
Invoke-RestMethod http://ipinfo.io/json | Select -exp ip
```


You can also follow the steps in [Find your IP address](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026518/windows-10-find-your-ip-address) or search on *what is my IP address?* in an internet browser.

# Install the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on using an ARM template

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Important

The KEDA add-on for AKS doesn't currently support modifying the CPU requests or limits and other Helm values for the [Metrics Server](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/metrics-server/) or [Operator](https://keda.sh/docs/2.14/operate/cluster/). Keep this limitation in mind when using the add-on. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues).

This article shows you how to deploy the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using an [ARM template](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/).

Important

Your cluster Kubernetes version determines what KEDA version will be installed on your AKS cluster. To see which KEDA version maps to each AKS version, see the **AKS managed add-ons** column of the [Kubernetes component version table](/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions#aks-components-breaking-changes-by-version).

For GA Kubernetes versions, AKS offers full support of the corresponding KEDA minor version in the table. Kubernetes preview versions and the latest KEDA patch are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Note

KEDA version 2.15+ introduces a breaking change that [removes pod identity support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). We recommend moving over to workload identity for your authentication if you're using pod identity. While the KEDA managed add-on doesn't currently run KEDA version 2.15+, it will begin running it in the AKS preview version 1.31.

For more information on how to securely scale your applications with workload identity, please read our [tutorial](keda-workload-identity). To view KEDA's breaking change/deprecation policy, please read their [official documentation](https://github.com/kedacore/governance/blob/main/DEPRECATIONS.md).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - You need the
[Azure CLI installed](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - This article assumes you have an existing Azure resource group. If you don't have an existing resource group, you can create one using the
command.`az group create`

- Ensure you have firewall rules configured to allow access to the Kubernetes API server. For more information, see
[Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters](outbound-rules-control-egress#azure-global-required-network-rules). [Create an SSH key pair](#create-an-ssh-key-pair).

Note

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before Workload ID, you need to restart the KEDA operator pods so the proper environment variables can be injected:

Restart the pods by running

`kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system`

.Obtain KEDA operator pods using

`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

and finding pods that begin with`keda-operator`

.Verify successful injection of the environment variables by running

`kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod> -n kube-system`

. Under`Environment`

, you should see values for`AZURE_TENANT_ID`

,`AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

, and`AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`

.

## Create an SSH key pair

Navigate to the

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/).Create an SSH key pair using the

command.`az sshkey create`

`az sshkey create --name <sshkey-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>`


## Enable the KEDA add-on with an ARM template

Deploy the

[ARM template for an AKS cluster](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.kubernetes%2Faks%2Fazuredeploy.json).Select

**Edit template**.Enable the KEDA add-on by specifying the

`workloadAutoScalerProfile`

field in the ARM template, as shown in the following example:`"workloadAutoScalerProfile": { "keda": { "enabled": true } }`

Select

**Save**.Update the required values for the ARM template:

**Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription to use for the deployment.**Resource group**: Select the resource group to use for the deployment.**Region**: Select the region to use for the deployment.**Dns Prefix**: Enter a unique DNS name to use for the cluster.**Linux Admin Username**: Enter a username for the cluster.**SSH public key source**: Select**Use existing key stored in Azure**.**Store Keys**: Select the key pair you created earlier in the article.

Select

**Review + create**>**Create**.

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local device, you use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client.

If you use the Azure Cloud Shell, `kubectl`

is already installed. You can also install it locally using the [ az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

- Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, use the[az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials)command. The following example gets credentials for the AKS cluster named*MyAKSCluster*in the*MyResourceGroup*:

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyAKSCluster
```


## Example deployment

The following snippet is a sample deployment that creates a cluster with KEDA enabled with a single node pool comprised of three `DS2_v5`

nodes.

```

## Start scaling apps with KEDA

You can autoscale your apps with KEDA using custom resource definitions (CRDs). For more information, see the [KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/).

## Remove resources

Remove the resource group and all related resources using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name <resource-group-name>`


## Next steps

This article showed you how to install the KEDA add-on on an AKS cluster, and then verify that it's installed and running. With the KEDA add-on installed on your cluster, you can [deploy a sample application](https://github.com/kedacore/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue) to start scaling apps.

For information on KEDA troubleshooting, see [Troubleshoot the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on](/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/troubleshoot-kubernetes-event-driven-autoscaling-add-on?context=/azure/aks/context/aks-context).

# Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

One way to route Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and secure (HTTPS) traffic to applications running on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster is to use the [Kubernetes Ingress object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). When you create an Ingress object that uses the application routing add-on NGINX Ingress classes, the add-on creates, configures, and manages one or more Ingress controllers in your AKS cluster.

This article shows you how to deploy and configure a basic Ingress controller in your AKS cluster.

## Application routing add-on with NGINX features

The application routing add-on with NGINX delivers the following:

- Easy configuration of managed NGINX Ingress controllers based on
[Kubernetes NGINX Ingress controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/). - Integration with
[Azure DNS](/en-us/azure/dns/dns-overview)for public and private zone management - SSL termination with certificates stored in Azure Key Vault.

For other configurations, see:

[DNS and SSL configuration](app-routing-dns-ssl)[Application routing add-on configuration](app-routing-nginx-configuration)[Configure internal NGIX ingress controller for Azure private DNS zone](create-nginx-ingress-private-controller).

With the retirement of [Open Service Mesh](https://release-v1-2.docs.openservicemesh.io/) (OSM) by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), using the application routing add-on with OSM is not recommended.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.54.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Limitations

- The application routing add-on supports up to five Azure DNS zones.
- The application routing add-on can only be enabled on AKS clusters with
[managed identity](use-managed-identity). - All global Azure DNS zones integrated with the add-on have to be in the same resource group.
- All private Azure DNS zones integrated with the add-on have to be in the same resource group.
- Editing the ingress-nginx
`ConfigMap`

in the`app-routing-system`

namespace isn't supported. - The following snippet annotations are blocked and will prevent an Ingress from being configured:
`load_module`

,`lua_package`

,`_by_lua`

,`location`

,`root`

,`proxy_pass`

,`serviceaccount`

,`{`

,`}`

,`'`

.

## Enable application routing using Azure CLI

### Enable on a new cluster

To enable application routing on a new cluster, use the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command, specifying the

`--enable-app-routing`

flag.```
az aks create \
--resource-group <ResourceGroupName> \
--name <ClusterName> \
--location <Location> \
--enable-app-routing \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


### Enable on an existing cluster

To enable application routing on an existing cluster, use the [ az aks approuting enable](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/approuting#az-aks-approuting-enable) command.

```
az aks approuting enable --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ClusterName>
```


## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [ az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed.Configure `kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the [az aks get-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-get-credentials) command.

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ClusterName>
```


## Deploy an application

The application routing add-on uses annotations on Kubernetes Ingress objects to create the appropriate resources.

Create the application namespace called

`aks-store`

to run the example pods using the`kubectl create namespace`

command.`kubectl create namespace aks-store`

Deploy the AKS store application using the following YAML manifest file:

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/sample-manifests/docs/app-routing/aks-store-deployments-and-services.yaml -n aks-store`


This manifest will create the necessary deployments and services for the AKS store application.

### Create the Ingress object

The application routing add-on creates an Ingress class on the cluster named *webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com*. When you create an Ingress object with this class, it activates the add-on.

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**ingress.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: store-front namespace: aks-store spec: ingressClassName: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com rules: - http: paths: - backend: service: name: store-front port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix`

Create the ingress resource using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n aks-store`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`ingress.networking.k8s.io/store-front created`


## Verify the managed Ingress was created

You can verify the managed Ingress was created using the `kubectl get ingress`

command.

```
kubectl get ingress -n aks-store
```


The following example output shows the created managed Ingress:

```
NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE
store-front webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com * 51.8.10.109 80 110s
```


You can verify that the AKS store works pointing your browser to the public IP address of the Ingress controller. Find the IP address with kubectl:

```
kubectl get service -n app-routing-system nginx -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}"
```


## Remove the application routing add-on

To remove the associated namespace, use the `kubectl delete namespace`

command.

```
kubectl delete namespace aks-store
```


To remove the application routing add-on from your cluster, use the [ az aks approuting disable](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/approuting#az-aks-approuting-disable) command.

```
az aks approuting disable --name <ClusterName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName>
```


Note

To avoid potential disruption of traffic into the cluster when the application routing add-on is disabled, some Kubernetes resources, including *configMaps*, *secrets*, and the *deployment* that runs the controller, will remain on the cluster. These resources are in the *app-routing-system* namespace. You can remove these resources if they're no longer needed by deleting the namespace with `kubectl delete ns app-routing-system`

.

# Customize the node configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Customizing your node configuration allows you to adjust operating system (OS) settings or kubelet parameters to match the needs of your workloads. When you create an AKS cluster or add a node pool to your cluster, you can customize a subset of commonly used OS and kubelet settings. To configure settings beyond this subset, you can [use a daemon set to customize your needed configurations without losing AKS support for your nodes](support-policies#shared-responsibility).

## Create custom node configuration files for AKS node pools

OS and kubelet configuration changes require you to create a new configuration file with the parameters and your desired settings. If a value for a parameter isn't specified, then the value is set to the default.

Note

The following examples show common configuration settings. You can modify the settings to meet your workload requirements. For a full list of supported custom configuration parameters, see the [Supported custom configuration parameters](#supported-custom-configuration-parameters) section.

### Kubelet configuration

Create a `linuxkubeletconfig.json`

file with the following contents:

```
{
"cpuManagerPolicy": "static",
"cpuCfsQuota": true,
"cpuCfsQuotaPeriod": "200ms",
"imageGcHighThreshold": 90,
"imageGcLowThreshold": 70,
"topologyManagerPolicy": "best-effort",
"allowedUnsafeSysctls": [
"kernel.msg*",
"net.*"
],
"failSwapOn": false
}
```


### OS configuration

Create a `linuxosconfig.json`

file with the following contents:

```
{
"transparentHugePageEnabled": "madvise",
"transparentHugePageDefrag": "defer+madvise",
"swapFileSizeMB": 1500,
"sysctls": {
"netCoreSomaxconn": 163849,
"netIpv4TcpTwReuse": true,
"netIpv4IpLocalPortRange": "32000 60000"
}
}
```


## Create an AKS cluster using custom configuration files

Note

Keep the following information in mind when using custom configuration files when creating a new AKS cluster:

- If you specify a configuration when creating a cluster, the configuration applies only to the nodes in the initial node pool. Any settings not configured in the JSON file retain their default values.
`CustomLinuxOsConfig`

isn't supported for the Windows OS type.

Create a new cluster using custom configuration files using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and specifying your configuration files for the

`--kubelet-config`

and `--linux-os-config`

parameters. The following example command creates a new cluster with the custom `./linuxkubeletconfig.json`

and `./linuxosconfig.json`

files:```
az aks create --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --kubelet-config ./linuxkubeletconfig.json --linux-os-config ./linuxosconfig.json
```


## Add a node pool using custom configuration files

Note

Keep the following information in mind when using custom configuration files when adding a new node pool to an existing AKS cluster:

- When you add a Linux node pool to an existing cluster, you can specify the kubelet configuration, OS configuration, or both. When you add a Windows node pool to an existing cluster, you can only specify the kubelet configuration. If you specify a configuration when adding a node pool, the configuration applies only to the nodes in the new node pool. Any settings not configured in the JSON file retain their default values.
`CustomKubeletConfig`

is supported for Linux and Windows node pools.

Create a new Linux node pool using the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command and specifying your configuration files for the

`--kubelet-config`

and `--linux-os-config`

parameters. The following example command creates a new Linux node pool with the custom `./linuxkubeletconfig.json`

file:```
az aks nodepool add --name <node-pool-name> --cluster-name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --kubelet-config ./linuxkubeletconfig.json
```


## Confirm settings were applied

After you apply custom node configuration, you can confirm the settings were applied to the nodes by [connecting to the host](node-access) and verifying `sysctl`

or configuration changes were made on the filesystem.

## Supported custom configuration parameters

### Linux kubelet custom configuration

| Parameter | Allowed values/interval | Default | Description |

places no restrictions on syscalls, allowing all system calls and reducing security. For more information, see the [containerd default seccomp profile](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/f0a32c66dad1e9de716c9960af806105d691cd78/contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go#L51). This parameter is in preview.[Register](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/preview-features?tabs=azure-cli#register-preview-feature)the "KubeletDefaultSeccompProfilePreview" feature flag using the[command with](/en-us/cli/azure/feature#az-feature-register)`az feature register`

`--namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"`

.### Windows kubelet custom configuration

| Parameter | Allowed values/interval | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
`imageGcHighThreshold` |
0-100 | 85 | The percent of disk usage after which image garbage collection is always run. Minimum disk usage that triggers garbage collection. To disable image garbage collection, set to 100. |
`imageGcLowThreshold` |
0-100, no higher than `imageGcHighThreshold` |
80 | The percent of disk usage before which image garbage collection is never run. Minimum disk usage that can trigger garbage collection. |
`containerLogMaxSizeMB` |
Size in megabytes (MB) | 10 | The maximum size (for example, 10 MB) of a container log file before it gets rotated. |
`containerLogMaxFiles` |
≥ 2 | 5 | The maximum number of container log files that can be present for a container. |

## Linux custom OS configuration settings

Important

To simplify search and readability, the OS settings are displayed in this article by their name, but they should be added to the configuration JSON file or AKS API using the [camelCase capitalization convention](/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions).

For example, if you modify the `vm.max_map_count setting`

, you should reformat to `vmMaxMapCount`

in the configuration JSON file.

### Linux file handle limits

When serving high amounts of traffic, that traffic commonly comes from a large number of local files. You can adjust the following kernel settings and built-in limits to allow you to handle more, at the cost of some system memory.

The following table lists the file handle limits that you can customize per node pool:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`fs.file-max` |
8192 - 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | 9223372036854775807 | Maximum number of file-handles that the Linux kernel allocates. This value is set to the maximum possible value (2^63-1) to prevent file descriptor exhaustion and ensure unlimited system-wide file handles for containerized workloads. |
`fs.inotify.max_user_watches` |
781250 - 2097152 | 1048576 | 1048576 | 1048576 | Maximum number of file watches allowed by the system. Each watch is roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. |
`fs.aio-max-nr` |
65536 - 6553500 | 65536 | 65536 | 65536 | The aio-nr shows the current system-wide number of asynchronous io requests. aio-max-nr allows you to change the maximum value aio-nr can grow to. |
`fs.nr_open` |
8192 - 20000500 | 1048576 | 1048576 | 1073741816 | The maximum number of file-handles a process can allocate. |

Note

The `fs.file-max`

parameter is set to 9223372036854775807 (the maximum value for a signed 64-bit integer) across Ubuntu and Azure Linux based on upstream defaults. This configuration:

**Prevents denial-of-service attacks**based on system-wide file descriptor exhaustion.**Ensures container workloads**are never bottlenecked by system-wide file handle limits.**Maintains security**through per-process limits (`fs.nr_open`

and`ulimit`

) which still apply to individual processes.**Optimizes for container platforms**where many containers might run simultaneously, each potentially opening many files and network connection.

### Linux socket and network tuning

For agent nodes, which are expected to handle large numbers of concurrent sessions, you can use following TCP and network options and adjust them per node pool:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`net.core.somaxconn` |
4096 - 3240000 | 16384 | 16384 | 16384 | Maximum number of connection requests that can be queued for any given listening socket. An upper limit for the value of the backlog parameter passed to the
`somaxconn` , then it's silently truncated to this limit. |

`net.core.netdev_max_backlog`

`net.core.rmem_max`

`net.core.wmem_max`

`net.core.optmem_max`

`net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog`

`net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets`

`timewait`

sockets held by system simultaneously. If this number is exceeded, time-wait socket is immediately destroyed and warning is printed.`net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout`

`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time`

`keepalive`

messages when `keepalive`

is enabled.`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes`

`keepalive`

probes TCP sends out, until it decides that the connection is broken.`net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl`

it makes up the time to kill a connection that isn't responding, after probes started.`net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse`

`TIME-WAIT`

sockets for new connections when it's safe from protocol viewpoint.`net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2`

`net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3`

`net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max`

`nf_conntrack`

is a module that tracks connection entries for NAT within Linux. The `nf_conntrack`

module uses a hash table to record the *established connection*record of the TCP protocol.`nf_conntrack_max`

is the maximum number of nodes in the hash table, that is, the maximum number of connections supported by the `nf_conntrack`

module or the size of connection tracking table. **Default value**is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula:`RAM_in_bytes / 16384`

(or `RAM_in_MB * 64`

). For example, a VM with 8 GB RAM has a default of approximately 524,288 connections. Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory.`net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_buckets`

`nf_conntrack`

is a module that tracks connection entries for NAT within Linux. The `nf_conntrack`

module uses a hash table to record the *established connection*record of the TCP protocol.`nf_conntrack_buckets`

is the size of hash table. **Default value**is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula:`RAM_in_bytes / 16384`

, with a minimum of 1,024 buckets and a maximum of 262,144 buckets. The default `nf_conntrack_max`

is typically set to `nf_conntrack_buckets * 4`

. Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory.### Linux worker limits

Like file descriptor limits, the number of workers or threads that a process can create are limited by both a kernel setting and user limits. The user limit on AKS is unlimited. The following table lists the kernel setting that you can customize per node pool:

| Setting | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
`kernel.threads-max` |
Dynamically calculated | Dynamically calculated | Dynamically calculated | Processes can spin up worker threads. The maximum number of all threads that can be created is set with the kernel setting `kernel.threads-max` . Default value is dynamically calculated based on system memory using the formula: `total_ram_pages / 4` (where each page is typically 4 KB). Actual values vary based on the VM size and available memory. |

### Linux virtual memory

The following table lists the kernel settings that you can customize per node pool to tune the operation of the virtual memory (VM) subsystem of the Linux kernel and the `writeout`

of dirty data to disk:

| Setting | Allowed values/interval | Ubuntu 22.04 default | Ubuntu 24.04 default | Azure Linux 3.0 default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
`vm.max_map_count` |
65530 | 1048576 | 1048576 | This file contains the maximum number of memory map areas a process can have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect of calling `malloc` , directly by `mmap` , `mprotect` , and `madvise` , and also when loading shared libraries. |
|
`vm.vfs_cache_pressure` |
1 - 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | This percentage value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory, which is used for caching of directory and inode objects. |
`vm.swappiness` |
0 - 100 | 60 | 60 | 60 | This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps memory pages. Higher values increase aggressiveness, lower values decrease the amount of swap. A value of 0 instructs the kernel not to initiate swap until the amount of free and file-backed pages is less than the high water mark in a zone. |
`swapFileSizeMB` |

[Transparent Hugepages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html#admin-guide-transhuge)is a Linux kernel feature intended to improve performance by making more efficient use of your processor's memory-mapping hardware. When enabled the kernel attempts to allocate`hugepages`

whenever possible and any Linux process receives 2-MB pages if the `mmap`

region is 2 MB naturally aligned. In certain cases when `hugepages`

are enabled system wide, applications might end up allocating more memory resources. An application might `mmap`

a large region but only touch 1 byte of it, in that case a 2-MB page might be allocated instead of a 4k page for no good reason. This scenario is why it's possible to disable `hugepages`

system-wide or to only have them inside `MADV_HUGEPAGE madvise`

regions.`transparentHugePageDefrag`
