Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. You build and deploy your own applications and services into a Kubernetes cluster and let the cluster manage the availability and connectivity.

In this tutorial, you deploy a sample application into a Kubernetes cluster. You learn how to:

- Update a Kubernetes manifest file.
- Run an application in Kubernetes.
- Test the application.

Tip

With AKS, you can use the following approaches for configuration management:

**GitOps**: Enables declarations of your cluster's state to automatically apply to the cluster. To learn how to use GitOps to deploy an application with an AKS cluster, see the[prerequisites for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/tutorial-use-gitops-flux2?toc=/azure/aks/toc.json#for-azure-kubernetes-service-clusters)in the[GitOps with Flux v2](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/tutorial-use-gitops-flux2?toc=/azure/aks/toc.json)tutorial.**DevOps**: Enables you to build, test, and deploy with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). To see examples of how to use DevOps to deploy an application with an AKS cluster, see[Build and deploy to AKS with Azure Pipelines](devops-pipeline)or[GitHub Actions for deploying to Kubernetes](kubernetes-action).

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you packaged an application into a container image, uploaded the image to Azure Container Registry, and created a Kubernetes cluster. To complete this tutorial, you need the precreated `aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

Kubernetes manifest file. This file was downloaded in the application source code from [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.0.53 or later. Check your version with `az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update the manifest file

In these tutorials, your Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance stores the container images for the sample application. To deploy the application, you must update the image names in the Kubernetes manifest file to include your ACR login server name.

Get your login server address using the

command and query for your login server.`az acr list`

`az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table`

Make sure you're in the cloned

*aks-store-demo*directory, and then open the`aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

manifest file with a text editor.Update the

`image`

property for the containers by replacing*ghcr.io/azure-samples*with your ACR login server name.`containers: ... - name: order-service image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/order-service:latest ... - name: product-service image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/product-service:latest ... - name: store-front image: <acrName>.azurecr.io/aks-store-demo/store-front:latest ...`

Save and close the file.


## Run the application

Deploy the application using the

command, which parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

The following example output shows the resources successfully created in the AKS cluster:

`statefulset.apps/rabbitmq created configmap/rabbitmq-enabled-plugins created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created`

Check the deployment is successful by viewing the pods with the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods`


## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

### Command Line

Monitor progress using the

command with the`kubectl get service`

`--watch`

argument.`kubectl get service store-front --watch`

Initially, the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

for the`store-front`

service shows as`<pending>`

:`store-front LoadBalancer 10.0.34.242 <pending> 80:30676/TCP 5s`

When the

`EXTERNAL-IP`

address changes from`<pending>`

to a public IP address, use`CTRL-C`

to stop the`kubectl`

watch process.The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

`store-front LoadBalancer 10.0.34.242 52.179.23.131 80:30676/TCP 67s`

View the application in action by opening a web browser and navigating to the external IP address of your service:

`http://<external-ip>`

.

If the application doesn't load, it might be an authorization problem with your image registry. To view the status of your containers, use the `kubectl get pods`

command. If you can't pull the container images, see [Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service](cluster-container-registry-integration).

### Azure portal

Navigate to the Azure portal to find your deployment information.

Navigate to your AKS cluster resource.

From the service menu, under

**Kubernetes Resources**, select**Services and ingresses**.Copy the External IP shown in the column for the

`store-front`

service.Paste the IP into your browser to visit your store page.


## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can now remove the cluster from the application. We will deploy the application again in the next tutorial.

Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the

`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml`

Check that all the application pods have been removed using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods`


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you deployed a sample Azure application to a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learned how to:

- Update a Kubernetes manifest file.
- Run an application in Kubernetes.
- Test the application.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to use PaaS services for stateful workloads in Kubernetes.

# Best practices for basic scheduler features in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

As you manage clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you often need to isolate teams and workloads. The Kubernetes scheduler lets you control the distribution of compute resources, or limit the impact of maintenance events.

This best practices article focuses on basic Kubernetes scheduling features for cluster operators. In this article, you learn how to:

- Use resource quotas to provide a fixed amount of resources to teams or workloads
- Limit the impact of scheduled maintenance using pod disruption budgets

## Enforce resource quotas


Best practice guidancePlan and apply resource quotas at the namespace level. If pods don't define resource requests and limits, reject the deployment. Monitor resource usage and adjust quotas as needed.


Resource requests and limits are placed in the pod specification. Requests are used by the Kubernetes scheduler at deployment time to find an available node in the cluster. Limits and requests work at the individual pod level. For more information about how to define these values, see [Define pod resource requests and limits](developer-best-practices-resource-management#define-pod-resource-requests-and-limits).

To provide a way to reserve and limit resources across a development team or project, you should use *resource quotas*. These quotas are defined on a namespace, and can be used to set quotas on the following basis:

**Compute resources**, such as CPU and memory, or GPUs.**Storage resources**, including the total number of volumes or amount of disk space for a given storage class.**Object count**, such as maximum number of secrets, services, or jobs can be created.

Kubernetes doesn't overcommit resources. Once your cumulative resource request total passes the assigned quota, all further deployments will be unsuccessful.

When you define resource quotas, all pods created in the namespace must provide limits or requests in their pod specifications. If they don't provide these values, you can reject the deployment. Instead, you can [configure default requests and limits for a namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/).

The following example YAML manifest named *dev-app-team-quotas.yaml* sets a hard limit of a total of *10* CPUs, *20Gi* of memory, and *10* pods:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
name: dev-app-team
spec:
hard:
cpu: "10"
memory: 20Gi
pods: "10"
```


This resource quota can be applied by specifying the namespace, such as *dev-apps*:

```
kubectl apply -f dev-app-team-quotas.yaml --namespace dev-apps
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate resource quotas.

For more information about available resource objects, scopes, and priorities, see [Resource quotas in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/).

## Plan for availability using pod disruption budgets


Best practice guidanceTo maintain the availability of applications, define Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) to make sure that a minimum number of pods are available in the cluster.


There are two disruptive events that cause pods to be removed:

### Involuntary disruptions

*Involuntary disruptions* are events beyond the typical control of the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Hardware failure on the physical machine
- Kernel panic
- Deletion of a node VM

Involuntary disruptions can be mitigated by:

- Using multiple replicas of your pods in a deployment.
- Running multiple nodes in the AKS cluster.

### Voluntary disruptions

*Voluntary disruptions* are events requested by the cluster operator or application owner. Include:

- Cluster upgrades
- Updated deployment template
- Accidentally deleting a pod

Kubernetes provides *pod disruption budgets* for voluntary disruptions, letting you plan for how deployments or replica sets respond when a voluntary disruption event occurs. Using pod disruption budgets, cluster operators can define a minimum available or maximum unavailable resource count.

If you upgrade a cluster or update a deployment template, the Kubernetes scheduler will schedule extra pods on other nodes before allowing voluntary disruption events to continue. The scheduler waits to reboot a node until the defined number of pods are successfully scheduled on other nodes in the cluster.

Let's look at an example of a replica set with five pods that run NGINX. The pods in the replica set are assigned the label `app: nginx-frontend`

. During a voluntary disruption event, such as a cluster upgrade, you want to make sure at least three pods continue to run. The following YAML manifest for a *PodDisruptionBudget* object defines these requirements:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
minAvailable: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


You can also define a percentage, such as *60%*, which allows you to automatically compensate for the replica set scaling up the number of pods.

You can define a maximum number of unavailable instances in a replica set. Again, a percentage for the maximum unavailable pods can also be defined. The following pod disruption budget YAML manifest defines that no more than two pods in the replica set be unavailable:

```
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
name: nginx-pdb
spec:
maxUnavailable: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx-frontend
```


Once your pod disruption budget is defined, you create it in your AKS cluster as with any other Kubernetes object:

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-pdb.yaml
```


Work with your application developers and owners to understand their needs and apply the appropriate pod disruption budgets.

For more information about using pod disruption budgets, see [Specify a disruption budget for your application](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/).
