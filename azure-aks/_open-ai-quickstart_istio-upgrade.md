Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to deploy an application that uses Azure OpenAI or OpenAI on AKS. With OpenAI, you can easily adapt different AI models, such as content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code generation, for your specific tasks. You start by deploying an AKS cluster in your Azure subscription. Then, you deploy your OpenAI service and the sample application.

The sample cloud native application is representative of real-world implementations. The multi-container application is comprised of applications written in multiple languages and frameworks, including:

- Golang with Gin
- Rust with Actix-Web
- JavaScript with Vue.js and Fastify
- Python with FastAPI

These applications provide front ends for customers and store admins, REST APIs for sending data to RabbitMQ message queue and MongoDB database, and console apps to simulate traffic.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

To access the GitHub codebase for the sample application, see [AKS Store Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).

## Before you begin

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one,
[create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). - For this demo, you can either use Azure OpenAI service or OpenAI service.
- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the
[Request access to Azure OpenAI Service form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). - If you plan on using OpenAI, sign up on the
[OpenAI website](https://openai.com/).

- If you plan on using Azure OpenAI service, you need to request access to enable it on your Azure subscription using the

## Prerequisites

Use the Bash environment in

[Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see[Get started with Azure Cloud Shell](/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).If you prefer to run CLI reference commands locally,

[install](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)the Azure CLI. If you're running on Windows or macOS, consider running Azure CLI in a Docker container. For more information, see[How to run the Azure CLI in a Docker container](/en-us/cli/azure/run-azure-cli-docker).If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI by using the

[az login](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login)command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For other sign-in options, see[Authenticate to Azure using Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).When you're prompted, install the Azure CLI extension on first use. For more information about extensions, see

[Use and manage extensions with the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).Run

[az version](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version)to find the version and dependent libraries that are installed. To upgrade to the latest version, run[az upgrade](/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).


## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) is a logical group in which you deploy and manage Azure resources. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

The following example output shows successful creation of the resource group:

`{ "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup", "location": "eastus", "managedBy": null, "name": "myResourceGroup", "properties": { "provisioningState": "Succeeded" }, "tags": null, "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups" }`


## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in *myResourceGroup*.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks create`

`az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --generate-ssh-keys`

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.


## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, you use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/). `kubectl`

is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`

Note

If your Linux-based system requires elevated permissions, you can use the

`sudo az aks install-cli`

command.Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

This command executes the following operations:

- Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
- Uses
`~/.kube/config`

, the default location for the[Kubernetes configuration file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/). Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using*--file*argument.

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.`kubectl get`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the nodes created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is

*Ready*.`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6 aks-nodepool1-31469198-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h29m v1.25.6`


Note

For private clusters, the nodes might be unreachable if you try to connect to them through the public IP address. In order to fix this, you need to create an endpoint within the same VNET as the cluster to connect from. Follow the instructions to [Create a private AKS cluster](private-clusters) and then connect to it.

## Deploy the application

The [AKS Store application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

**Product service**: Shows product information.**Order service**: Places orders.**Makeline service**: Processes orders from the queue and completes the orders.**Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.**Store admin**: Web application for store employees to view orders in the queue and manage product information.**Virtual customer**: Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis.**Virtual worker**: Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis.**Mongo DB**: NoSQL instance for persisted data.**Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

Note

We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as MongoDB and Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. We use them here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

Review the

[YAML manifest](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml)for the application.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/main/aks-store-all-in-one.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/mongodb created service/mongodb created deployment.apps/rabbitmq created service/rabbitmq created deployment.apps/order-service created service/order-service created deployment.apps/makeline-service created service/makeline-service created deployment.apps/product-service created service/product-service created deployment.apps/store-front created service/store-front created deployment.apps/store-admin created service/store-admin created deployment.apps/virtual-customer created deployment.apps/virtual-worker created`


## Deploy OpenAI

You can either use Azure OpenAI or OpenAI and run your application on AKS.

- In the Azure portal, create an Azure OpenAI instance.
- Navigate to the Azure OpenAI instance you created.
- From the
**Overview**blade, navigate to the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). - Create a new
**Chat**deployment using the**gpt-4o-mini**base model.

For more information on how to create a deployment in Azure OpenAI, see [Get started generating text using Azure OpenAI Service](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Deploy the AI service

Now that the application is deployed, you can deploy the Python-based microservice that uses OpenAI to automatically generate descriptions for new products being added to the store's catalog.

Create a file named

`ai-service.yaml`

and copy in the following manifest:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: ai-service spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: ai-service template: metadata: labels: app: ai-service spec: nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": linux containers: - name: ai-service image: ghcr.io/azure-samples/aks-store-demo/ai-service:latest ports: - containerPort: 5001 env: - name: USE_AZURE_OPENAI value: "True" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME value: "" - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT value: "" - name: OPENAI_API_KEY value: "" resources: requests: cpu: 20m memory: 50Mi limits: cpu: 50m memory: 128Mi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: ai-service spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - name: http port: 5001 targetPort: 5001 selector: app: ai-service`

Set the environment variable

`USE_AZURE_OPENAI`

to`"True"`

.Get your Azure OpenAI deployment name from

[Azure AI Foundry](https://oai.azure.com/portal/)and fill in the`AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`

value.Get your Azure OpenAI endpoint and Azure OpenAI API key from the Azure portal by selecting

**Keys and Endpoint**in the left blade of the resource. Update the`AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`

and`OPENAI_API_KEY`

in the YAML accordingly.Deploy the application using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ai-service.yaml`

The following example output shows the successfully created deployments and services:

`deployment.apps/ai-service created service/ai-service created`


Note

Directly adding sensitive information, such as API keys, to your Kubernetes manifest files isn't secure and may accidentally get committed to code repositories. We added it here for simplicity. For production workloads, use [Managed Identity](/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity#authorize-access-to-managed-identities) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI service instead or store your secrets in [Azure Key Vault](csi-secrets-store-driver).

## Test the application

Check the status of the deployed pods using the

[kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get)command.`kubectl get pods`

Make sure all the pods are

*Running*before continuing to the next step.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE makeline-service-7db94dc7d4-8g28l 1/1 Running 0 99s mongodb-78f6d95f8-nptbz 1/1 Running 0 99s order-service-55cbd784bb-6bmfb 1/1 Running 0 99s product-service-6bf4d65f74-7cbvk 1/1 Running 0 99s rabbitmq-9855984f9-94nlm 1/1 Running 0 99s store-admin-7f7d768c48-9hn8l 1/1 Running 0 99s store-front-6786c64d97-xq5s9 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-customer-79498f8667-xzsb7 1/1 Running 0 99s virtual-worker-6d77fff4b5-7g7rj 1/1 Running 0 99s`

Get the IP of the store admin web application and store front web application using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service store-admin`

The application exposes the Store Admin site to the internet via a public load balancer provisioned by the Kubernetes service. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

**EXTERNAL IP**initially shows*pending*until the service comes up and shows the IP address.`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE store-admin LoadBalancer 10.0.142.228 40.64.86.161 80:32494/TCP 50m`

Repeat the same step for the service named `store-front``.

Open a web browser and browse to the external IP address of your service. In the example shown here, open

*40.64.86.161*to see Store Admin in the browser. Repeat the same step for Store Front.In store admin, select the products tab, then select

**Add Products**.When the `ai-service`` is running successfully, you should see the Ask OpenAI button next to the description field. Fill in the name, price, and keywords, then generate a product description by selecting

**Ask OpenAI**>**Save product**.You can now see the new product you created on Store Admin used by sellers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added.

You can also see the new product you created on Store Front used by buyers. In the picture, you can see Dog Smart Collar is added. Remember to get the IP address of store front using the

command.`kubectl get service`


## Next steps

Now that you added OpenAI functionality to an AKS application, you can [Secure access to Azure OpenAI from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](open-ai-secure-access-quickstart).

# Upgrade Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article addresses upgrade experiences for Istio-based service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Announcements about the releases of new minor revisions or patches to the Istio-based service mesh add-on are published in the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To learn more about the release schedule and support for service mesh add-on revisions, read the [support policy](istio-support-policy#versioning-and-support-policy).

## Minor revision upgrade

Istio add-on allows upgrading the minor revision using [canary upgrade process](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/). When an upgrade is initiated, the control plane of the new (canary) revision is deployed alongside the initial (stable) revision's control plane. You can then manually roll over data plane workloads while using monitoring tools to track the health of workloads during this process. If you don't observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can complete the upgrade so that only the new revision remains on the cluster. Else, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio.

Available upgrades depend on whether the current Istio revision and AKS cluster version are supported:

- You can upgrade to the
**next supported revision (**or skip one and upgrade to`n+1`

), as long as both are supported and compatible with the cluster version.`n+2`

- If both your current revision (
`n`

) and the next revision (`n+1`

) are unsupported, you can only upgrade to the**nearest supported revision (**, but not beyond it.`n+2`

or higher) - If the cluster version and Istio revision are both unsupported, the cluster version must be upgraded before an Istio upgrade can be initiated.

Note

Once an AKS version or mesh revision falls outside the support window, upgrading either version becomes error-prone. While such upgrades are **allowed** to recover to a supported version, **the upgrade process and the out-of-support versions themselves are both not supported by Microsoft**. We strongly recommend keeping AKS version and mesh revision up to date to avoid running into unsupported scenarios. Refer to the [Istio add-on support calendar](istio-support-policy#service-mesh-add-on-release-calendar) for estimated release and end-of-life dates and the [upstream Istio release notes](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/) for the new revision for notable changes.

The following example illustrates how to upgrade from revision `asm-1-23`

to `asm-1-24`

with all workloads in the `default`

namespace. The steps are the same for all minor upgrades and may be used for any number of namespaces.

Use the

[az aks mesh get-upgrades](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-upgrades)command to check which revisions are available for the cluster as upgrade targets:`az aks mesh get-upgrades --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

If you expect to see a newer revision not returned by this command, you may need to upgrade your AKS cluster first so that it's compatible with the newest revision.

If you set up

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)for the existing mesh revision on your cluster, you need to create a separate ConfigMap corresponding to the new revision in the`aks-istio-system`

namespace**before initiating the canary upgrade**in the next step. This configuration is applicable the moment the new revision's control plane is deployed on cluster. More details can be found[here](istio-meshconfig#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades).Initiate a canary upgrade from revision

`asm-1-23`

to`asm-1-24`

using[az aks mesh upgrade start](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/mesh/upgrade#az-aks-mesh-upgrade-start):`az aks mesh upgrade start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER --revision asm-1-24`

A canary upgrade means the 1.24 control plane is deployed alongside the 1.23 control plane. They continue to coexist until you either complete or roll back the upgrade.

While a canary upgrade is in progress, the higher revision is considered the

*default revision*used for validation of Istio resources.Optionally, revision tags may be used to roll over the data plane to the new revision without needing to manually relabel each namespace. Manually relabeling namespaces when moving them to a new revision can be tedious and error-prone.

[Revision tags](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/#stable-revision-labels)solve this problem by serving as stable identifiers that point to revisions.Rather than relabeling each namespace, a cluster operator can change the tag to point to a new revision. All namespaces labeled with that tag are updated at the same time. However, you still need to restart the workloads to make sure the correct version of

`istio-proxy`

sidecars are injected.To use revision tags during an upgrade:

Create a revision tag for the initial revision. In this example, we name it

`prod-stable`

:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Create a revision tag for the revision installed during the upgrade. In this example, we name it

`prod-canary`

:`istioctl tag set prod-canary --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

Label application namespaces to map to revision tags:

`# label default namespace to map to asm-1-23 kubectl label ns default istio.io/rev=prod-stable --overwrite`

You may also label namespaces with

`istio.io/rev=prod-canary`

for the newer revision. However, the workloads in those namespaces aren't updated to a new sidecar until they're restarted.If a new application is created in a namespace after it is labeled, a sidecar will be injected corresponding to the revision tag on that namespace.


Verify control plane pods corresponding to both

`asm-1-23`

and`asm-1-24`

exist:Verify

`istiod`

pods:`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-system`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-dbzlt 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-23-55fccf84c8-fg8zh 1/1 Running 0 58m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-7rwg4 1/1 Running 0 51m istiod-asm-1-24-f85f46bf5-8p9qx 1/1 Running 0 51m`

If ingress is enabled, verify ingress pods:

`kubectl get pods -n aks-istio-ingress`

Example output:

`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-qkvq2 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-23-58f889f99d-vhtd5 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-ft9c8 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-external-asm-1-24-7466f77bb9-wcb6s 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-4cc2l 1/1 Running 0 58m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-23-579c5d8d4b-jjc7m 1/1 Running 0 59m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-g89s4 1/1 Running 0 51m aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal-asm-1-24-757d9b5545-krq9w 1/1 Running 0 51m`

Observe that ingress gateway pods of both revisions are deployed side-by-side. However, the service and its IP remain immutable.


Relabel the namespace so that any new pods are mapped to the Istio sidecar associated with the new revision and its control plane:

If using revision tags, overwrite the

`prod-stable`

tag itself to change its mapping:`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-24 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Verify the tag-to-revision mappings:

`istioctl tag list`

Both tags should point to the newly installed revision:

`TAG REVISION NAMESPACES prod-canary asm-1-24 default prod-stable asm-1-24 ...`

In this case, you don't need to relabel each namespace individually.

If not using revision tags, data plane namespaces must be relabeled to point to the new revision:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-24 --overwrite`


Relabeling doesn't affect your workloads until they're restarted.

Individually roll over each of your application workloads by restarting them. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Check your monitoring tools and dashboards to determine whether your workloads are all running in a healthy state after the restart. Based on the outcome, you have two options:

**Complete the canary upgrade**: If you're satisfied that the workloads are all running in a healthy state as expected, you can complete the canary upgrade. Completion of the upgrade removes the previous revision's control plane and leaves behind the new revision's control plane on the cluster. Run the following command to complete the canary upgrade:`az aks mesh upgrade complete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`

**Rollback the canary upgrade**: In case you observe any issues with the health of your workloads, you can roll back to the previous revision of Istio:

Relabel the namespace to the previous revision: If using revision tags:

`istioctl tag set prod-stable --revision asm-1-23 --istioNamespace aks-istio-system --overwrite`

Or, if not using revision tags:

`kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-1-23 --overwrite`

Roll back the workloads to use the sidecar corresponding to the previous Istio revision by restarting these workloads again:

`kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment name> -n <deployment namespace>`

Roll back the control plane to the previous revision:

`az aks mesh upgrade rollback --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER`


The

`prod-canary`

revision tag can be removed:`istioctl tag remove prod-canary --istioNamespace aks-istio-system`

If

[mesh configuration](istio-meshconfig)was previously set up for the revisions, you can now delete the ConfigMap for the revision that was removed from the cluster during complete/rollback.

### Minor revision upgrades with ingress and egress gateways

If you're currently using [Istio ingress gateways](istio-deploy-ingress) or [egress gateways](istio-deploy-egress) and are performing a minor revision upgrade, keep in mind that Istio ingress and egress gateway pods / deployments are deployed per-revision, but the service is shared across both revisions.

We provide a single `LoadBalancer`

service across all ingress gateway pods over multiple revisions, so the external/internal IP address of the ingress gateways remains unchanged throughout the course of an upgrade. Thus, during the canary upgrade, when two revisions exist simultaneously on the cluster, the ingress gateway pods of both revisions serve incoming traffic.

Likewise, during a canary upgrade, all pods for an egress gateway across both revisions will be served by a single `ClusterIP`

service.

### Minor revision upgrades with horizontal pod autoscaling customizations

If you have customized [horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) settings for Istiod or the ingress gateways](istio-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaling-customization), note the following behavior for how HPA settings are applied across both revisions to maintain consistency during a canary upgrade:

- If you update the HPA spec before initiating an upgrade, the settings from the existing (stable) revision will be applied to the HPAs of the canary revision when the new control plane is installed.
- If you update the HPA spec while a canary upgrade is in progress, the HPA spec of the stable revision will take precedence and be applied to the HPA of the canary revision.
- If you update the HPA of the stable revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be updated to reflect the new settings applied to the stable revision.
- If you update the HPA of the canary revision during an upgrade, the HPA spec of the canary revision will be reverted to the HPA spec of the stable revision.


## Patch version upgrade

- Istio add-on patch version availability information is published in
[AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). - Patches are rolled out automatically for istiod and ingress pods as part of these AKS releases, which respect the
`default`

[planned maintenance window](planned-maintenance)set up for the cluster. - User needs to initiate patches to Istio proxy in their workloads by restarting the pods for reinjection:
Check the version of the Istio proxy intended for new or restarted pods. This version is the same as the version of the istiod and Istio ingress pods after they were patched:

`kubectl get cm -n aks-istio-system -o yaml | grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless", "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless"`

Check the Istio proxy image version for all pods in a namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.23.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.23.0-distroless`

To trigger reinjection, restart the workloads. For example:

`kubectl rollout restart deployments/productpage-v1 -n default`

To verify that they're now on the newer versions, check the Istio proxy image version again for all pods in the namespace:

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' |\ sort |\ grep "mcr.microsoft.com\/oss\/istio\/proxyv2"`

Example output:

`productpage-v1-979d4d9fc-p4764: docker.io/istio/examples-bookinfo-productpage-v1:1.2.0, mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:1.24.0-distroless`
