Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

[Confidential Virtual Machines (CVM)](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview) offer strong security and confidentiality for tenants. CVMs offer VM based Hardware Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that leverage SEV-SNP security features to deny the hypervisor and other host management code access to VM memory and state, providing defense in depth protections against operator access. These features enable node pools with CVM to target the migration of highly sensitive container workloads to AKS without any code refactoring while benefiting from the features of AKS. For example, you may require CVM if you have the following:

- Workloads that handle security critical data and/or sensitive customer data
- Services that are required to meet various compliance requirements, especially for government contracts. Without a scalable solution for securing data, this could potentially lead to the loss of accreditations and contracts.

In this article, you learn how to create AKS node pools using Confidential VM sizes.

## AKS supported confidential VM sizes

Azure offers a choice of [Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/trusted-execution-environment) options from both AMD and Intel. These TEEs allow you to create Confidential VM environments with excellent price-to-performance ratios, all without requiring any code changes.

- AMD-based Confidential VMs, use AMD SEV-SNP technology, which is introduced with third Gen AMD EPYC™ processors.
- Intel-based Confidential VMs use Intel TDX, with fourth Gen Intel® Xeon® processors.

Both technologies have different implementations. However both provide similar protections from the cloud infrastructure stack. For more information, see [CVM VM sizes](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/virtual-machine-options).

## Security Features

CVMs offer the following security enhancements as compared to other virtual machine (VM) sizes:

- Robust hardware-based isolation between virtual machines, hypervisor, and host management code.
- Customizable attestation policies to ensure the host's compliance before deployment.
- Cloud-based Confidential OS disk encryption before the first boot.
- VM encryption keys that the platform or the customer (optionally) owns and manages.
- Secure key release with cryptographic binding between the platform's successful attestation and the VM's encryption keys.
- Dedicated virtual Trusted Platform Module (TPM) instance for attestation and protection of keys and secrets in the virtual machine.
- Secure boot capability similar to Trusted launch for Azure VMs

## How does it work?

If you're running a workload that requires enhanced confidentiality and integrity, you can benefit from memory encryption and enhanced security without code changes in your application. All pods on your CVM node are part of the same trust boundary. The nodes in a node pool created with CVM use a customized [node image](node-images) specially configured for CVM.

### Supported OS Versions

You can create CVM node pools on Linux OS types (Ubuntu and Azure Linux). However, not all OS versions support CVM node pools.

This table includes the supported OS versions:

| OS Type | OS SKU | CVM support | CVM default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | `Ubuntu` |
Supported | Ubuntu 20.04 is default for K8s version 1.24-1.33. Ubuntu 24.04 is the default for K8s version 1.34-1.38. |
| Linux | `Ubuntu2204` |
Not Supported | AKS doesn't support CVM for Ubuntu 22.04. |
| Linux | `Ubuntu2404` |
Supported | CVM is supported on `Ubuntu2404` in K8s 1.32-1.38. |
| Linux | `AzureLinux` |
Supported on Azure Linux 3.0 | Azure Linux 3 is default when enabling CVM for K8s version 1.28-1.36. |
| Linux | `flatcar` |
Not supported |
|

`AzureLinuxOSGuard`

[Azure Linux with OS Guard for AKS](use-azure-linux-os-guard)doesn't support CVM.When using `Ubuntu`

or `AzureLinux`

as the `osSKU`

, if the default OS version doesn't support CVM, AKS defaults to the most recent CVM-supported version of the OS. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 is default for Linux node pools. Since 22.04 doesn't currently support CVM, AKS defaults to Ubuntu 20.04 for Linux CVM-enabled node pools.

### Limitations

The following limitations apply when adding a node pool with CVM to AKS:

- You can't use FIPS, ARM64, Trusted Launch, or Pod Sandboxing.
- You can't update an existing node pool to migrate to a CVM size. To migrate, you'll need to
[resize your node pool](resize-node-pool). - You can't use CVM with Windows node pools.
- CVM with Azure Linux is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An existing AKS cluster.
- CVM sizes must be available for your subscription in the region where the cluster is created. You must have sufficient quota to create a node pool with a CVM size.
- If you're using Azure Linux os, you need to install the
`aks-preview`

extension, update the`aks-preview`

extension, and register the preview feature flag. If you're using Ubuntu, you can skip these steps.

### If you are using Azure Linux

CVMs for Ubuntu is GA, but CVMs with Azure Linux is currently still in preview. If you would like to use CVM node pools with Azure Linux as the OS of choice, ensure you enable the extension and register the flag.

#### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


#### Register `AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

feature flag using the [`az feature register`

][az-feature-register] command.`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureLinuxCVMPreview"`

Verify the registration status using the [

`az feature show`

][az-feature-show] command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AzureLinuxCVMPreview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using the [`az provider register`

][az-provider-register] command.`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Add a node pool with a CVM to your AKS cluster

Add a node pool with a CVM to your AKS cluster using the

command and set the`az aks nodepool add`

`node-vm-size`

to a supported[VM size](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/virtual-machine-options).`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size Standard_DC4as_v5`


If you don't specify the `osSKU`

or `osType`

, AKS defaults to `--os-type Linux`

and `--os-sku Ubuntu`

.

## Upgrade an existing node pool with a CVM to Ubuntu 24.04

Upgrade an existing node pool with a CVM to Ubuntu 24.04 from Ubuntu 20.04 using the

command. Set the`az aks nodepool update`

`os-sku`

as`Ubuntu2404`

.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --os-sku Ubuntu2404`


Note

A node pool which is Ubuntu 24.04 with a CVM is supported from AKS cluster 1.33 version. Additionally, before Ubuntu 24.04 becomes GA, you need to register the `Ubuntu2404Preview`

feature. For more information, see [ here](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version#register-ubuntu2404preview-feature-flag) to register the feature.

## Verify the node pool uses CVM

Verify a node pool uses CVM using the

command and verify the`az aks nodepool show`

`vmSize`

is`Standard_DCa4_v5`

.`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'vmSize'`

The following example command and output shows the node pool uses CVM:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'vmSize' "Standard_DC4as_v5"`

Verify a node pool uses a CVM image using the

command.`az aks nodepool list`

`az aks nodepool list \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'nodeImageVersion'`

The following example command and output shows the node pool uses an Ubuntu 20.04 CVM image:

`az aks nodepool show \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool \ --query 'nodeImageVersion' "AKSUbuntu-2004cvmcontainerd-202507.02.0"`


## Remove a node pool with CVM from an AKS cluster

Remove a node pool with CVM from an AKS cluster using the

command.`az aks nodepool delete`

`az aks nodepool delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name cvmnodepool`


## Next steps

# Configure LocalDNS in Azure Kubernetes Service

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

LocalDNS is a feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) designed to enhance the Domain Name System (DNS) resolution performance and resiliency for workloads running in your cluster. When you deploy a DNS proxy on each node, LocalDNS reduces DNS query latency, improves reliability during network disruptions, and provides advanced configuration options for DNS caching and forwarding. This article explains how LocalDNS works, its configuration options, and how to enable, verify, and troubleshoot LocalDNS in your AKS clusters.

To learn about what LocalDNS is, including architecture details, and key capabilities, refer to [DNS Resolution in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](dns-concepts).

## Best practices for LocalDNS configuration

When implementing LocalDNS in your AKS clusters, consider the following best practices:

**Start with a minimal configuration**: Begin with a simple configuration that uses the`Preferred`

mode before moving to`Required`

mode. This setup allows you to validate that LocalDNS works as expected without breaking your cluster.**Implement proper caching strategies**: Configure cache settings based on your workload characteristics:- For frequently changing records, use shorter
`cacheDurationInSeconds`

values. When doing so, it's important to note that cacheDurationInSeconds acts as a cap on the DNS record TTL but doesn't increase it. The resulting TTL is the smaller of what is returned from upstream or what is set in the cache plugin. - For stable records, use longer cache durations to reduce DNS queries.
- Enable
`serveStale`

with appropriate settings to maintain service during DNS outages. - Caching with LocalDNS operates on a best effort basis and doesn't guarantee stale responses. The cache is divided into 256 shards and with a default maximum of 10,000 entries, allowing each shard to hold about 39 entries. When a shard is full and a new entry needs to be added, one of the existing entries is chosen at random to be evicted. There's no preference for older or expires entries. As a result, a stale record might not always be available, especially under high query volume.

- For frequently changing records, use shorter
**Monitor DNS performance**: After enabling LocalDNS, monitor your application's DNS performance using:- Application performance metrics.
- Node metrics to detect reduced network pressure.
- Log entries when
`queryLogging`

is set to`Log`

.

**Follow least privilege principle**: When configuring DNS forwarding rules, only allow access to the required DNS servers and domains.**Test before production deployment**: Always test LocalDNS configuration in a nonproduction environment before rolling it out to production clusters.**Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Store your*localdnsconfig.json*file in your infrastructure repository and include it in your AKS deployment templates.**Network configuration for TCP forwarding**: When using TCP for DNS forwarding to VnetDNS, ensure that your Network Security Groups (NSGs), firewalls, or Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) don't block TCP traffic between CoreDNS/LocalDNS and VnetDNS servers.**Avoid enabling both NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS**: It isn't recommended to enable both the upstream Kubernetes NodeLocal DNSCache and LocalDNS in your node pool. While AKS doesn't block this configuration, all DNS traffic is routed through LocalDNS, which might lead to unexpected behavior or reduced benefits from NodeLocal DNSCache.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an existing AKS cluster with Kubernetes versions 1.31 or later to use LocalDNS. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - This article requires version 2.80.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
- LocalDNS is only supported on node pools running Azure Linux or Ubuntu 22.04 or newer.
- The Virtual Machine (VM) SKU used for your node pool must have at least 4 vCPUs (cores) to support LocalDNS.
- LocalDNS isn't compatible with
[applied FQDN filter policies in Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS)](how-to-apply-fqdn-filtering-policies).

## Manage LocalDNS on an AKS cluster

LocalDNS is configured at the node pool level in AKS, meaning you can enable or disable LocalDNS independently for each node pool in your cluster. This tailors DNS resolution behavior based on the specific requirements of different workloads or environments. To enable LocalDNS on a node pool, you need to provide a configuration file: *localdnsconfig.json* that defines how LocalDNS should operate for that node pool.

If you don't specify a custom configuration file, AKS automatically applies a default LocalDNS configuration.

Note

If you're using Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP), see [LocalDNS configuration](node-auto-provisioning-aksnodeclass#localdns-configuration) for instructions on how to enable LocalDNS with NAP.

To enable LocalDNS during node pool creation, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool add --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


To enable LocalDNS on an existing node pool, use the following command with your custom configuration file:

```
az aks nodepool update --name mynodepool1 --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --localdns-config ./localdnsconfig.json
```


Important

Enabling LocalDNS on a node pool initiates a reimage operation on all nodes within that pool. This process can cause temporary disruption to running workloads and might lead to application downtime if not properly managed. You should plan for potential service interruptions and ensure that the applications are configured for high availability or have appropriate disruption budgets in place before enabling this setting.

## Create a custom server block in LocalDNS

CoreDNS matches queries to a specific server block based on an exact match for domain being queried and not on partial matches. If you have the need for custom server blocks, you can add them to your LocalDNS configuration by creating a file called *localdnsconfig.json* with the added configurations.

For example, if you have specific DNS needs when accessing microsoft.com, you could use the following server block:

```
"microsoft.com": {
"queryLogging": "Error",
"protocol": "ForceTCP",
"forwardDestination": "ClusterCoreDNS",
"forwardPolicy": "Sequential",
"maxConcurrent": 1000,
"cacheDurationInSeconds": 3600,
"serveStaleDurationInSeconds": 3600,
"serveStale": "Immediate"
}
```


## Monitor LocalDNS

LocalDNS exposes Prometheus metrics that you can use for monitoring and alerting. These [metrics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-scrape-default#coredns) are exposed on port `9253`

of the Node IP and can be scraped from there.

The following example YAML shows a scrape configuration you can use with the [Azure Managed Prometheus add on as a DaemonSet](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-scrape-configuration):

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
name: ama-metrics-prometheus-config-node
namespace: kube-system
data:
prometheus-config: |-
global:
scrape_interval: 1m
scrape_configs:
- job_name: localdns-metrics
scrape_interval: 1m
scheme: http
metrics_path: /metrics
relabel_configs:
- source_labels: [__metrics_path__]
regex: (.*)
target_label: metrics_path
- source_labels: [__address__]
replacement: '$NODE_NAME'
target_label: instance
static_configs:
- targets: ['$NODE_IP:9253']
```


## Troubleshoot LocalDNS

### DNS queries to specific domains are failing

If DNS queries to specific domains are failing after enabling LocalDNS:

- Check if you have domain-specific overrides in your
*localdnsconfig.json*that might be misconfigured. - Temporarily try removing domain-specific overrides and using only the default
`.`

configuration. - Check if the issue occurs with both User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) by adjusting the
`protocol`

setting.

### Update VNet DNS servers for LocalDNS

When you update custom DNS servers directly in the VNet configuration (using the Azure portal or CLI), these changes aren't automatically applied to your AKS cluster nodes. This happens because updating DNS settings at the VNet level only informs the Network Resource Provider (NRP), but doesn't notify the AKS Resource Provider. As a result, AKS nodes continue to use the previous DNS server settings until further action is taken.

To ensure AKS nodes pick up the new VNet DNS server settings:

Update the VNet DNS configuration using the Azure portal or APIs as needed.

Reimage the node pool through the AKS Resource Provider to apply and persist the DNS changes:

`az aks nodepool upgrade --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool --node-image-only`


This process ensures the AKS Resource Provider is aware of the DNS changes and applies them to all nodes in the node pool.
