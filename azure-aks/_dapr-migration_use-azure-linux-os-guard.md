# Migrate from Dapr OSS to the Dapr extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to migrate from Dapr OSS to the Dapr extension for AKS.

You can configure the Dapr extension to use and manage the Kubernetes resources created by Dapr OSS by either:

[Checking for an existing Dapr installation using the Azure CLI](#check-for-an-existing-dapr-installation)(*default method*), or[Configuring the existing Dapr installation using](#configure-the-existing-dapr-installation-using---configuration-settings).`--configuration-settings`


For more information, see [an overview of the Dapr extension for AKS](dapr-overview).

## Check for an existing Dapr installation

When you [install the Dapr extension](dapr), the extension checks for an existing Dapr installation on your cluster. If Dapr exists, the extension uses and manages the Kubernetes resources created by Dapr OSS.

List the details of your current Dapr installation using the

`helm list -A`

command and save the Dapr release name and namespace from the output.`helm list -A`

Enter the Helm release name and namespace (from

`helm list -A`

) when prompted with the following questions:`Enter the Helm release name for Dapr, or press Enter to use the default name [dapr]: Enter the namespace where Dapr is installed, or press Enter to use the default namespace [dapr-system]:`


## Configure the existing Dapr installation using `--configuration-settings`


When you [create the Dapr extension](dapr), you can configure the extension to use and manage the Kubernetes resources created by Dapr OSS using the `--configuration-settings`

flag.

List the details of your current Dapr installation using the

`helm list -A`

command and save the Dapr release name and namespace from the output.`helm list -A`

Create the Dapr extension using the

and use the`az k8s-extension create`

`--configuration-settings`

flags to set the Dapr release name and namespace.`az k8s-extension create --cluster-type managedClusters \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name dapr \ --extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \ --configuration-settings "existingDaprReleaseName=dapr" \ --configuration-settings "existingDaprReleaseNamespace=dapr-system"`


## Update HA mode or placement service settings

When installing the Dapr extension on top of an existing Dapr installation, you receive the following message:

```
The extension will be installed on your existing Dapr installation. Note, if you have updated the default values for global.ha.* or dapr_placement.* in your existing Dapr installation, you must provide them in the configuration settings. Failing to do so will result in an error, since Helm upgrade will try to modify the StatefulSet. See <link> for more information.
```


Kubernetes only allows patching for limited fields in StatefulSets. If any of the HA mode or placement service settings are configured, the upgrade fails. To update the HA mode or placement service settings, you must delete the stateful set and then update the HA mode.

Delete the stateful set using the

`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete statefulset.apps/dapr-placement-server -n dapr-system`

Update the HA mode using the

command.`az k8s-extension update`

`az k8s-extension update --cluster-type managedClusters \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name dapr \ --extension-type Microsoft.Dapr \ --auto-upgrade-minor-version true \ --configuration-settings "global.ha.enabled=true" \`


For more information, see the [Dapr production guidelines](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-production/#enabling-high-availability-in-an-existing-dapr-deployment).

# Azure Linux with OS Guard (preview) for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) overview

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides an overview of Azure Linux with OS Guard (preview) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including key features, region availability, and resources to get started.

## What is Azure Linux with OS Guard?

Azure Linux with OS Guard is a hardened, immutable variant of Azure Linux. It provides strong runtime integrity, tamper resistance, and enterprise-grade security for container hosts on AKS. OS Guard is built on Azure Linux and adds kernel and runtime features that enforce code integrity, protect the root file system from unauthorized changes, and apply mandatory access controls.

You can deploy Azure Linux with OS Guard node pools in a new cluster, add Azure Linux with OS Guard node pools to your existing Azure Linux or Ubuntu clusters, or migrate your Azure Linux or Ubuntu nodes to Azure Linux with OS Guard nodes.

To learn more about Azure Linux with OS Guard, see the [Azure Linux with OS Guard documentation](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Why use Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS?

Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS builds on the benefits of [Azure Linux](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux#azure-linux-container-host-key-benefits) by adding enhanced security features that help protect your container workloads from advanced threats. OS Guard provides:

**Immutability**: The`/usr`

directory is mounted as a read-only volume protected by dm-verity, preventing execution of tampered or untrusted code.**Code integrity**: OS Guard integrates the[Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE) Linux Security Module](https://docs.kernel.org/next/admin-guide/LSM/ipe.html)to ensure that only binaries from trusted, signed volumes are allowed to execute. (**IPE is running in audit mode during Public Preview**.)**Mandatory access controls**: OS Guard integrates SELinux to limit which processes can access sensitive resources in the system. (**SELinux is operating in permissive mode during Public Preview**.)**Integration with Azure security features**: Native support for[Trusted Launch](/en-us/azure/aks/use-trusted-launch)and Secure Boot provides measured boot protections and attestation.**Verified container layers**: Container images and layers are validated using signed dm-verity hashes. This ensures that only verified layers are used at runtime, reducing the risk of container escape or tampering.**Sovereign Supply Chain Security**: OS Guard inherits Azure Linux’s secure build pipelines, signed Unified Kernel Images (UKIs) and Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs).

Learn more about the [key features of Azure Linux with OS Guard](/en-us/azure/azure-linux/intro-azure-linux-os-guard).

## Regional availability

Azure Linux with OS Guard is available for use in the same [regions](/en-us/azure/aks/quotas-skus-regions) as AKS.

## Get started with Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS

Get started with Azure Linux with OS Guard on AKS using the following resources:
