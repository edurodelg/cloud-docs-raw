Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Container security protects the entire end-to-end pipeline from build to the application workloads running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

The Secure Supply Chain includes the build environment and registry.

Kubernetes includes security components, such as *pod security standards* and *Secrets*. Azure includes components like Active Directory, Microsoft Defender for Containers, Azure Policy, Azure Key Vault, network security groups, and orchestrated cluster upgrades. AKS combines these security components to:

- Provide a complete authentication and authorization story.
- Apply AKS Built-in Azure Policy to secure your applications.
- End-to-End insight from build through your application with Microsoft Defender for Containers.
- Keep your AKS cluster running the latest OS security updates and Kubernetes releases.
- Provide secure pod traffic and access to sensitive credentials.

This article introduces the core concepts that secure your applications in AKS.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Build Security

As the entry point for the Supply Chain, it's important to conduct static analysis of image builds before they're promoted down the pipeline. This includes vulnerability and compliance assessment. It's not about failing a build because it has a vulnerability, as that breaks development. It's about looking at the **Vendor Status** to segment based on vulnerabilities that are actionable by the development teams. Also use **Grace Periods** to allow developers time to remediate identified issues.

## Registry Security

Assessing the vulnerability state of the image in the Registry detects drift and also catches images that didn't come from your build environment. Use [Notary V2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) to attach signatures to your images to ensure deployments are coming from a trusted location.

## Cluster security

In AKS, the Kubernetes master components are part of the managed service provided, managed, and maintained by Microsoft. Each AKS cluster has its own single-tenanted, dedicated Kubernetes master to provide the API Server, Scheduler, etc. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for Azure Kubernetes Service](concepts-vulnerability-management).

By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can limit access to the API server endpoint using [authorized IP ranges](api-server-authorized-ip-ranges). You can also create a fully [private cluster](private-clusters) to limit API server access to your virtual network.

You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) and Azure RBAC. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra integration with AKS](managed-azure-ad).

## Node security

AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines (VMs) that you manage and maintain.

- Linux nodes run optimized versions of Ubuntu or Azure Linux.
- Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server release using the
`containerd`

container runtime.

When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.

Note

AKS clusters running:

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and higher - Linux node pools use
`containerd`

as its container runtime. Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 node pools use`containerd`

as its container runtime. For more information, see[Add a Windows Server node pool with](create-node-pools).`containerd`

- Kubernetes version 1.19 and earlier - Linux node pools use Docker as its container runtime.

For more information about the security upgrade process for Linux and Windows worker nodes, see [Security patching nodes](concepts-vulnerability-management#worker-nodes).

AKS clusters running Azure Generation 2 VMs include support for [Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch). This feature protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques by combining technologies that you can enable independently, like secure boot and a virtualized version of the trusted platform module (vTPM). Administrators can deploy AKS worker nodes with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and drivers to ensure integrity of the entire boot chain of the underlying VM.

### Container and security optimized OS options

AKS released support for two new optimized Linux OS options. [Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/azure-linux-os-guard) is Microsoft-created and optimized for Azure. OS Guard is built on top of Azure Linux with specialized configuration to support containerized workloads with security optimizations. [Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)](https://aka.ms/aks/flatcar) is a CNCF-based vendor-neutral container-optimized immutable OS, best suited for running on multicloud and on-premises environments. These OS options provide increased security when compared to other Linux OS options, such as:

- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS have an immutable operating system that you can't modify at runtime. All OS binaries, libraries and static configuration are read-only, and the bit-for-bit integrity is often cryptographically protected. These special purpose operating systems ship as self-contained images and come without any kind of package management or other traditional means of altering the OS. User workloads run in isolated environments like containers, sandboxed from the OS.
- Both Azure Linux OS Guard and Flatcar Container Linux for AKS use SELinux for Mandatory Access Control.
- Azure Linux OS Guard enforces
[FIPS](enable-fips-nodes)and[Trusted Launch](use-trusted-launch)enablement, providing improved compliance and protection against advanced and persistent attacks by combining secure boot and virtualized version of trusted platform module (vTPM).

When deciding between which container-optimized OS options to use, AKS recommends the following:

- Use
if you're looking for a vendor neutral immutable OS with cross-cloud support.**Flatcar Container Linux for AKS (preview)** - Use
if you're looking for an enterprise-ready immutable OS, recommended by Microsoft.**Azure Linux OS Guard (preview)** - Use
[Ubuntu](https://aka.ms/aks/supported-ubuntu-versions)if you're looking for a vendor neutral, general purpose OS with cross-cloud support. - Use
[Azure Linux](https://aka.ms/aks/use-azure-linux)if you're looking for an enterprise-ready, general purpose OS, recommended by Microsoft.


### Node authorization

Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode that specifically authorizes kubelet API requests to protect against East-West attacks. Node authorization is enabled by default on AKS 1.24 + clusters.

### Node deployment

Nodes are deployed onto a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, SSH is enabled by default and only accessible using the internal IP address. Disabling SSH during cluster and node pool creation, or for an existing cluster or node pool, is in preview. See [Manage SSH access](manage-ssh-node-access) for more information.

### Node storage

To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, Azure Managed Disks are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, Azure Managed Disks are securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.

### Hostile multitenant workloads

Currently, Kubernetes environments aren't safe for hostile multitenant usage. Extra security features, like *Pod Security Policies* or Kubernetes RBAC for nodes, efficiently block exploits. For true security when running hostile multitenant workloads, only trust a hypervisor. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node.

For these types of hostile multitenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters. For more information on ways to isolate workloads, see [Best practices for cluster isolation in AKS](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation).

### Compute isolation

Because of compliance or regulatory requirements, certain workloads may require a high degree of isolation from other customer workloads. For these workloads, Azure provides:

[Kernel isolated containers](/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-containers)to use as the agent nodes in an AKS cluster. These containers are completely isolated to a specific hardware type and isolated from the Azure Host fabric, the host operating system, and the hypervisor. They're dedicated to a single customer. Select[one of the isolated VMs sizes](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/isolation)as the**node size**when creating an AKS cluster or adding a node pool.[Confidential Containers](confidential-containers-overview)(preview), also based on Kata Confidential Containers, encrypts container memory and prevents data in memory during computation from being in clear text, readable format, and tampering. It helps isolate your containers from other container groups/pods, and VM node OS kernel. Confidential Containers (preview) uses hardware based memory encryption (SEV-SNP).[Pod Sandboxing](use-pod-sandboxing)(preview) provides an isolation boundary between the container application and the shared kernel and compute resources (CPU, memory, and network) of the container host.

## Network security

For connectivity and security with on-premises networks, you can deploy your AKS cluster into existing Azure virtual network subnets. These virtual networks connect back to your on-premises network using Azure Site-to-Site VPN or Express Route. Define Kubernetes ingress controllers with private, internal IP addresses to limit services access to the internal network connection.

### Azure network security groups

To filter virtual network traffic flow, Azure uses network security group rules. These rules define the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols allowed or denied access to resources. Default rules are created to allow TLS traffic to the Kubernetes API server. You create services with load balancers, port mappings, or ingress routes. AKS automatically modifies the network security group for traffic flow.

If you provide your own subnet for your AKS cluster (whether using Azure CNI or Kubenet), **do not** modify the NIC-level network security group managed by AKS. Instead, create more subnet-level network security groups to modify the flow of traffic. Make sure they don't interfere with necessary traffic managing the cluster, such as load balancer access, communication with the control plane, or [egress](limit-egress-traffic).

### Kubernetes network policy

To limit network traffic between pods in your cluster, AKS offers support for [Kubernetes network policies](use-network-policies). With network policies, you can allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors.

## Application Security

To protect pods running on AKS, consider [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction) to detect and restrict cyber attacks against your applications running in your pods. Run continual scanning to detect drift in the vulnerability state of your application and implement a "blue/green/canary" process to patch and replace the vulnerable images.

## Secure container access to resources

In the same way that you should grant users or groups the minimum privileges required, you should also limit containers to only necessary actions and processes. To minimize the risk of attack, avoid configuring applications and containers that require escalated privileges or root access. Built-in Linux security features such as *AppArmor* and *seccomp* are recommended as [best practices](/en-us/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-cluster-security) to [secure container access to resources][secure-container-access].

## Kubernetes Secrets

With a Kubernetes *Secret*, you inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys.

- Create a Secret using the Kubernetes API.
- Define your pod or deployment and request a specific Secret.
- Secrets are only provided to nodes with a scheduled pod that requires them.
- The Secret is stored in
*tmpfs*, not written to disk.

- When you delete the last pod on a node requiring a Secret, the Secret is deleted from the node's
*tmpfs*.- Secrets are stored within a given namespace and are only accessible from pods within the same namespace.


Using Secrets reduces the sensitive information defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret.

Note

The raw secret manifest files contain the secret data in base64 format. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). Treat these files as sensitive information, and never commit them to source control.

Kubernetes secrets are stored in *etcd*, a distributed key-value store. AKS allows [encryption at rest of secrets in etcd using customer managed keys](use-kms-etcd-encryption).

# Passive-cold solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. When the region becomes unavailable during a disaster, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

This guide outlines a passive-cold solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with only one cluster actively serving traffic when the application is needed.

Note

The following practice has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Passive-cold solution overview

In this approach, we have two independent AKS clusters being deployed in two Azure regions. When the application is needed, we activate the passive cluster to receive traffic. If the passive cluster goes down, we must manually activate the cold cluster to take over the flow of traffic. We can set this condition through a manual input every time or to specify a certain event.

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented as a “use as needed” workload, which is useful for scenarios that require workloads to run at specific times of day or run on demand. Example use cases for a passive-cold approach include:

- A manufacturing company that needs to run a complex and resource-intensive simulation on a large dataset. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a cloud region that offers high-performance computing and storage services. The passive cluster is only used when the simulation is triggered by the user or by a schedule. If the cluster doesn’t work upon triggering, the cold cluster can be used as a backup and the workload can run on it instead.
- A government agency that needs to maintain a backup of its critical systems and data in case of a cyber attack or natural disaster. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a secure and isolated location that’s not accessible to the public.

## Components

The passive-cold disaster recovery solution uses many Azure services. This example architecture involves the following components:

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. When the app is needed, the passive cluster is activated to receive network traffic.

**Key Vault**: You provision an [Azure Key Vault](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) in each region to store secrets and keys.

**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

**Hub-spoke pair**: A hub-spoke pair is deployed for each regional AKS instance. [Azure Firewall Manager](/en-us/azure/firewall-manager/overview) policies manage the firewall rules across each region.

**Container Registry**: The container images for the workload are stored in a managed container registry. With this solution, a single [Azure Container Registry](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) instance is used for all Kubernetes instances in the cluster. Geo-replication for Azure Container Registry enables you to replicate images to the selected Azure regions and provides continued access to images even if a region experiences an outage.

## Failover process

If the passive cluster isn't functioning properly because of an issue in its specific Azure region, you can activate the cold cluster and redirect all traffic to that cluster's region. You can use this process while the passive cluster is deactivated until it starts working again. The cold cluster can take a couple minutes to come online, as it has been turned off and needs to complete the setup process. This approach isn't ideal for time-sensitive applications. In that case, we recommend considering an [active-active failover](active-active-solution#failover-process).

### Application Pods (Regional)

A Kubernetes deployment object creates multiple replicas of a pod (*ReplicaSet*). If one is unavailable, traffic is routed between the remaining replicas. The Kubernetes *ReplicaSet* attempts to keep the specified number of replicas up and running. If one instance goes down, a new instance should be recreated. [Liveness probes](/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-liveness-probe) can check the state of the application or process running in the pod. If the pod is unresponsive, the liveness probe removes the pod, which forces the *ReplicaSet* to create a new instance.

For more information, see [Kubernetes ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/).

### Application Pods (Global)

When an entire region becomes unavailable, the pods in the cluster are no longer available to serve requests. In this case, the Azure Front Door instance routes all traffic to the remaining health regions. The Kubernetes clusters and pods in these regions continue to serve requests. To compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster, keep in mind the following guidance:

- Make sure network and compute resources are right sized to absorb any sudden increase in traffic due to region failover. For example, when using Azure Container Network Interface (CNI), make sure you have a subnet that can support all pod IPs with a spiked traffic load.
- Use the
[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](concepts-scale#horizontal-pod-autoscaler)to increase the pod replica count to compensate for the increased regional demand. - Use the AKS
[Cluster Autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler)to increase the Kubernetes instance node counts to compensate for the increased regional demand.

### Kubernetes node pools (Regional)

Occasionally, localized failure can occur to compute resources, such as power becoming unavailable in a single rack of Azure servers. To protect your AKS nodes from becoming a single point regional failure, use [Azure Availability Zones](availability-zones). Availability zones ensure that AKS nodes in each availability zone are physically separated from those defined in another availability zones.

### Kubernetes node pools (Global)

In a complete regional failure, Azure Front Door routes traffic to the remaining healthy regions. Again, make sure to compensate for increased traffic and requests to the remaining cluster.

## Failover testing strategy

While there are no mechanisms currently available within AKS to take down an entire region of deployment for testing purposes, [Azure Chaos Studio](/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-overview) offers the ability to create a chaos experiment on your cluster.

# Create and configure an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to use virtual nodes in the Azure portal

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Virtual nodes enable network communication between pods that run in Azure Container Instances (ACI) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. To provide this communication, a virtual network subnet is created and delegated permissions are assigned. Virtual nodes only work with AKS clusters created using *advanced* networking (Azure CNI). AKS clusters are created with *basic* networking (kubenet) by default.

This article shows you how to create a virtual network and subnets, and then deploy an AKS cluster that uses advanced networking using the Azure portal.

Note

For an overview of virtual node region availability and limitations, see [Use virtual nodes in AKS](virtual-nodes).

## Before you begin

You need the ACI service provider registered on your subscription.

Check the status of the ACI provider registration using the

command.`az provider list`

`az provider list --query "[?contains(namespace,'Microsoft.ContainerInstance')]" -o table`

The following example output shows the

*Microsoft.ContainerInstance*provider is*Registered*:`Namespace RegistrationState RegistrationPolicy --------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- Microsoft.ContainerInstance Registered RegistrationRequired`

If the provider is

*NotRegistered*, register it using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerInstance`


## Create an AKS cluster

- Navigate to the Azure portal home page.
- Select
**Create a resource**>**Containers**. - On the
**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**resource, select**Create**. - On the
**Basics**page, configure the following options:*Project details*: Select an Azure subscription, then select or create an Azure resource group, such as*myResourceGroup*.*Cluster details*: Enter a**Kubernetes cluster name**, such as*myAKSCluster*. Select a region and Kubernetes version for the AKS cluster.

- Select
**Next: Node pools**and check **Enable virtual nodes*. - Select
**Review + create**. - After the validation completes, select
**Create**.

By default, this process creates a managed cluster identity, which is used for cluster communication and integration with other Azure services. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity). You can also use a service principal as your cluster identity.

This process configures the cluster for advanced networking and the virtual nodes to use their own Azure virtual network subnet. The subnet has delegated permissions to connect Azure resources between the AKS cluster. If you don't already have a delegated subnet, the Azure portal creates and configures an Azure virtual network and subnet with the virtual nodes.

## Connect to the cluster

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell you can use to run the steps in this article. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. The `kubectl`

client is pre-installed in the Azure Cloud Shell.

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the cluster name`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*:`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify the connection to your cluster using the

.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows the single VM node created and the virtual Linux node named

*virtual-node-aci-linux*:`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION virtual-node-aci-linux Ready agent 28m v1.11.2 aks-agentpool-14693408-0 Ready agent 32m v1.11.2`


## Deploy a sample app

In the Azure Cloud Shell, create a file named

`virtual-node.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: aci-helloworld spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: aci-helloworld template: metadata: labels: app: aci-helloworld spec: containers: - name: aci-helloworld image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld ports: - containerPort: 80 nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/role: agent beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux type: virtual-kubelet tolerations: - key: virtual-kubelet.io/provider operator: Exists`

The YAML defines a

[nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)and[toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/), which allows the pod to be scheduled on the virtual node. The pod is assigned an internal IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet delegated for use with virtual nodes.Run the application using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f virtual-node.yaml`

View the pods scheduled on the node using the

command with the`kubectl get pods`

`-o wide`

argument.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the

`virtual-node-helloworld`

pod scheduled on the`virtual-node-linux`

node.`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE virtual-node-helloworld-9b55975f-bnmfl 1/1 Running 0 4m 10.241.0.4 virtual-node-aci-linux`


Note

If you use images stored in Azure Container Registry, [configure and use a Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/). A limitation of virtual nodes is you can't use integrated Microsoft Entra service principal authentication. If you don't use a secret, pods scheduled on virtual nodes fail to start and report the error `HTTP response status code 400 error code "InaccessibleImage"`

.

## Test the virtual node pod

To test the pod running on the virtual node, browse to the demo application with a web client. The pod is assigned an internal IP address, so you can easily test the connectivity from another pod on the AKS cluster.

Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it using the following

`kubectl run`

command.`kubectl run -it --rm virtual-node-test --image=mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:6.0`

Install

`curl`

in the pod using the following`apt-get`

command.`apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl`

Access the address of your pod using the following

`curl`

command and provide your internal IP address.`curl -L http://10.241.0.4`

The following condensed example output shows the demo application.

`<html> <head> <title>Welcome to Azure Container Instances!</title> </head> [...]`

Close the terminal session to your test pod with

`exit`

, which also deletes the pod.`exit`


## Next steps

In this article, you scheduled a pod on the virtual node and assigned a private, internal IP address. If you want, you can instead create a service deployment and route traffic to your pod through a load balancer or ingress controller. For more information, see [Create a basic ingress controller in AKS](ingress-basic).

Virtual nodes are one component of a scaling solution in AKS. For more information on scaling solutions, see the following articles:

# What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

This article is intended for platform administrators or developers who are looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

Note

AKS is [CNCF-certified](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) and is compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure compliance overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/compliance/).

## Container solutions in Azure

Azure offers a range of container solutions designed to accommodate various workloads, architectures, and business needs.

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that you can use to deploy and manage containerized applications. You need minimal container orchestration expertise to use AKS. AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is an ideal platform for deploying and managing containerized applications that require high availability, scalability, and portability, and for deploying applications to multiple regions, using open-source tools, and integrating with existing DevOps tools.

This article is intended for platform administrators or developers who are looking for a scalable, automated, managed Kubernetes solution.

## Overview of AKS

AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by shifting that responsibility to Azure. When you create an AKS cluster, Azure automatically creates and configures a control plane for you at no cost. The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications. Azure takes care of critical operations like health monitoring and maintenance, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

Note

AKS is [CNCF-certified](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/) and is compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure compliance overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/trusted-cloud/compliance/).

## Container solutions in Azure

Azure offers a range of container solutions designed to accommodate various workloads, architectures, and business needs.

# Use the cluster autoscaler in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

To keep up with application demands in AKS, you might need to adjust the number of nodes that run your workloads. The cluster autoscaler component watches for pods in your cluster that can't be scheduled because of resource constraints. When the cluster autoscaler detects issues, it scales up the number of nodes in the node pool to meet the application demands. It also regularly checks nodes for a lack of running pods and scales down the number of nodes as needed.

This article shows you how to enable and manage the cluster autoscaler in AKS, which is based on the [open-source Kubernetes version](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).

## Before you begin

This article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Use the cluster autoscaler on an AKS cluster

Important

The cluster autoscaler is a Kubernetes component. Although the AKS cluster uses a virtual machine scale set for the nodes, don't manually enable or edit settings for scale set autoscaling. Let the Kubernetes cluster autoscaler manage the required scale settings. For more information, see [Can I modify the AKS resources in the node resource group?](faq)

### Enable the cluster autoscaler on a new cluster

Create a resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus`

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster using the`az aks create`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command creates a cluster with a single node backed by a virtual machine scale set, enables the cluster autoscaler, sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --vm-set-type VirtualMachineScaleSets \ --load-balancer-sku standard \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --generate-ssh-keys`

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster

Update an existing cluster using the

command and enable and configure the cluster autoscaler on the node pool using the`az aks update`

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying a node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

. The following example command updates an existing AKS cluster to enable the cluster autoscaler on the node pool for the cluster and sets a minimum of one and maximum of three nodes:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3`

It takes a few minutes to update the cluster and configure the cluster autoscaler settings.


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

Disable the cluster autoscaler using the

command and the`az aks update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`

Nodes aren't removed when the cluster autoscaler is disabled.


Note

You can manually scale your cluster after disabling the cluster autoscaler using the [ az aks scale](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-scale) command. If you use the horizontal pod autoscaler, it continues to run with the cluster autoscaler disabled, but pods might end up unable to be scheduled if all node resources are in use.

### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a cluster

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the [ az aks update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.## Use the cluster autoscaler on node pools

### Use the cluster autoscaler on multiple node pools

You can use the cluster autoscaler with [multiple node pools](create-node-pools) and can enable the cluster autoscaler on each individual node pool and pass unique autoscaling rules to them.

Update the settings on an existing node pool using the

command.`az aks nodepool update`

`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


### Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

Disable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the

command and the`az aks nodepool update`

`--disable-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter.`az aks nodepool update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name nodepool1 \ --disable-cluster-autoscaler`


### Re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool

You can re-enable the cluster autoscaler on a node pool using the [ az aks nodepool update](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/tree/master/src/aks-preview#enable-cluster-auto-scaler-for-a-node-pool) command and specifying the

`--enable-cluster-autoscaler`

, `--min-count`

, and `--max-count`

parameters.Note

If you plan on using the cluster autoscaler with node pools that span multiple zones and leverage scheduling features related to zones, such as volume topological scheduling, we recommend you have one node pool per zone and enable `--balance-similar-node-groups`

through the autoscaler profile. This ensures the autoscaler can successfully scale up and keep the sizes of the node pools balanced.

## Update the cluster autoscaler settings

As your application demands change, you might need to adjust the cluster autoscaler node count to scale efficiently.

Change the node count using the

command and update the cluster autoscaler using the`az aks update`

`--update-cluster-autoscaler`

parameter and specifying your updated node`--min-count`

and`--max-count`

.`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --update-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 5`


Note

The cluster autoscaler enforces the minimum count in cases where the actual count drops below the minimum due to external factors, such as during a spot eviction or when changing the minimum count value from the AKS API.

## Use the cluster autoscaler profile

You can configure more granular details of the cluster autoscaler by changing the default values in the cluster-wide autoscaler profile. For example, a scale down event happens after nodes are under-utilized after 10 minutes. If you have workloads that run every 15 minutes, you might want to change the autoscaler profile to scale down under-utilized nodes after 15 or 20 minutes. When you enable the cluster autoscaler, a default profile is used unless you specify different settings.

Important

The cluster autoscaler profile affects **all node pools** that use the cluster autoscaler. You can't set an autoscaler profile per node pool. When you set the profile, any existing node pools with the cluster autoscaler enabled immediately start using the profile.

### Cluster autoscaler profile settings

The following table lists the available settings for the cluster autoscaler profile:

| Setting | Description | Default value |
|---|---|---|
`scan-interval` |
How often the cluster is reevaluated for scale up or down. | 10 seconds |
`scale-down-delay-after-add` |
How long after scale up that scale down evaluation resumes. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-delay-after-delete` |
How long after node deletion that scale down evaluation resumes. | `scan-interval` |
`scale-down-delay-after-failure` |
How long after scale down failure that scale down evaluation resumes. | Three minutes |
`scale-down-unneeded-time` |
How long a node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 10 minutes |
`scale-down-unready-time` |
How long an unready node should be unneeded before it's eligible for scale down. | 20 minutes |
`ignore-daemonsets-utilization` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be ignored when calculating resource utilization for scale down. | `false` |
`daemonset-eviction-for-empty-nodes` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from empty nodes. | `false` |
`daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes` |
Whether DaemonSet pods will be gracefully terminated from non-empty nodes. | `true` |
`scale-down-utilization-threshold` |
The maximum value between the sum of CPU requests and sum of Memory requests of all pods running on the node divided by node's corresponding allocatable resource, below which a node can be considered for scale down. | 0.5 |
`max-graceful-termination-sec` |
Maximum number of seconds the cluster autoscaler waits for pod termination when trying to scale down a node. | 600 seconds |
`balance-similar-node-groups` |
Detects similar node pools and balances the number of nodes between them. | `false` |
`expander` |
Type of node pool
`most-pods` , `random` , `least-waste` , and `priority` . |

`random`

`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods with local storage, for example, EmptyDir or HostPath.`false`

`skip-nodes-with-system-pods`

`true`

, cluster autoscaler doesn't delete nodes with pods from kube-system (except for DaemonSet or mirror pods).`true`

`max-empty-bulk-delete`

`new-pod-scale-up-delay`

`max-total-unready-percentage`

`max-node-provision-time`

`ok-total-unready-count`

Note

The ignore-daemonsets-utilization, daemonset-eviction-for-empty-nodes, and daemonset-eviction-for-occupied-nodes parameters are GA from API version 2024-05-01. If you are using the CLI to update these flags, please ensure you are using version 2.63 or later.

### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on a new cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the

command and set the cluster autoscaler profile using the`az aks create`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 1 \ --enable-cluster-autoscaler \ --min-count 1 \ --max-count 3 \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s \ --generate-ssh-keys`


### Set the cluster autoscaler profile on an existing cluster

Set the cluster autoscaler on an existing cluster using the

command and the`az aks update`

`cluster-autoscaler-profile`

parameter. The following example configures the scan interval setting as*30s*:`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s`


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for aggressive scale down

Note

Scaling down aggressively is not recommended for clusters experiencing frequent scale-outs and scale-ins within short intervals, as it could potentially result in extended node provisioning times under these circumstances. Increasing `scale-down-delay-after-add`

can help in these circumstances by keeping the node around longer to handle incoming workloads.

```
az aks update \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=30s,scale-down-delay-after-add=0m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=3m,scale-down-unready-time=3m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=1000,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Configure cluster autoscaler profile for bursty workloads

```
az aks update \
--resource-group "myResourceGroup" \
--name myAKSCluster \
--cluster-autoscaler-profile scan-interval=20s,scale-down-delay-after-add=10m,scale-down-delay-after-failure=1m,scale-down-unneeded-time=5m,scale-down-unready-time=5m,max-graceful-termination-sec=30,skip-nodes-with-local-storage=false,max-empty-bulk-delete=100,max-total-unready-percentage=100,ok-total-unready-count=1000,max-node-provision-time=15m
```


### Reset cluster autoscaler profile to default values

Reset the cluster autoscaler profile using the

command.`az aks update`

`az aks update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --cluster-autoscaler-profile ""`


## Retrieve cluster autoscaler logs and status

You can retrieve logs and status updates from the cluster autoscaler to help diagnose and debug autoscaler events. AKS manages the cluster autoscaler on your behalf and runs it in the managed control plane. You can enable control plane node to see the logs and operations from the cluster autoscaler.

Set up a rule for resource logs to push cluster autoscaler logs to Log Analytics using the

[instructions here](monitor-aks#aks-control-plane-resource-logs). Make sure you check the box for`cluster-autoscaler`

when selecting options for**Logs**.Select the

**Log**section on your cluster.Enter the following example query into Log Analytics:

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "cluster-autoscaler"`

View cluster autoscaler scale-up not triggered events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,reason=NotTriggerScaleUp`

View cluster autoscaler warning events on CLI.

`kubectl get events --field-selector source=cluster-autoscaler,type=Warning`

The cluster autoscaler also writes out the health status to a

`configmap`

named`cluster-autoscaler-status`

. You can retrieve these logs using the following`kubectl`

command:`kubectl get configmap -n kube-system cluster-autoscaler-status -o yaml`


For more information, see the [Kubernetes/autoscaler GitHub project FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#ca-doesnt-work-but-it-used-to-work-yesterday-why).

## Cluster Autoscaler Metrics

You can enable [control plane metrics (Preview)](monitor-control-plane-metrics) to see the logs and operations from the [cluster autoscaler](control-plane-metrics-default-list#minimal-ingestion-for-default-off-targets) with the [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus add-on](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview)

## Next steps

This article showed you how to automatically scale the number of AKS nodes. You can also use the horizontal pod autoscaler to automatically adjust the number of pods that run your application. For steps on using the horizontal pod autoscaler, see [Scale applications in AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-scale).

To further help improve cluster resource utilization and free up CPU and memory for other pods, see [Vertical Pod Autoscaler](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

# Configure AKSNodeClass resources for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains how to configure `AKSNodeClass`

resources to define Azure-specific settings for node auto-provisioning (NAP) in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Karpenter. `AKSNodeClass`

allows you to customize various aspects of the nodes that Karpenter provisions, such as the virtual machine (VM) image, operating system (OS) disk size, maximum pods per node, and kubelet configurations.

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Overview of AKSNodeClass resources

`AKSNodeClass`

resources enable you to configure Azure-specific settings for NAP. Each [ NodePool resource](node-auto-provisioning-node-pools) must reference an

`AKSNodeClass`

using `spec.template.spec.nodeClassRef`

. You can have multiple `NodePools`

that point to the same `AKSNodeClass`

, allowing you to share common Azure configurations across different node pools.## Image family configuration

The `imageFamily`

field dictates the default VM image and bootstrapping logic for nodes provisioned through the `AKSNodeClass`

. If you don't specify an image family, the default is `Ubuntu2204`

. GPUs are supported with both image families on compatible VM sizes.

### Supported image families

: Ubuntu 22.04 Long Term Support (LTS) is the default Linux distribution for AKS nodes.`Ubuntu`

: Azure Linux is Microsoft's alternative Linux distribution for AKS workloads. For more information, see the`AzureLinux`

[Azure Linux documentation](/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-linux)

#### Example image family configuration

The following example configures the `AKSNodeClass`

to use the `AzureLinux`

image family:

```
spec:
imageFamily: AzureLinux
```


#### FIPS compliant node image configuration

You can enable Federal Information Process Standard (FIPS) compliant node images also. For more in FIPS in AKS, visit our [FIPS documentation](enable-fips-nodes)

The `fipsMode`

field is set by default to Disabled, and can be set to the following options:

- FIPS - select FIPS-compliant node images
- Disabled - do not use FIPS-compliant node images

The following example configures the 'AKSNodeClass' to select FIPS-compliant node images by setting `fipsMode`

to `FIPS`

:

```
spec:
fipsMode: FIPS
```


## Virtual network (VNet) subnet configuration

The `vnetSubnetID`

field specifies which Azure VNet subnet should be used for provisioning node network interfaces. This field is optional. If you don't specify a subnet, NAP uses the default subnet configured during Karpenter installation. For more information, see [Subnet configurations for NAP](node-auto-provisioning-networking#subnet-configurations-for-nap).

### Example subnet configuration

The subnet ID must be in the full Azure Resource Manager (ARM) format, as shown in the following example:

```
spec:
vnetSubnetID: "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet-name}/subnets/{subnet-name}"
```


## OS disk size configuration

The `osDiskSizeGB`

field specifies the size of the OS disk in gigabytes. The default value is 128 GB, and the minimum value is 30 GB.

Consider larger OS disk sizes for workloads that:

- Store significant data locally.
- Require extra space for container images.
- Have high disk I/O requirements.

### Example OS disk size configuration

```
spec:
osDiskSizeGB: 256 # 256 GB OS disk
```


## Ephemeral OS disk configuration

NAP automatically uses [Ephemeral OS disks](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks) when available and suitable for the requested disk size. Ephemeral OS disks provide better performance and lower cost compared to managed disks.

### Ephemeral disk selection criteria

The system automatically chooses Ephemeral disks in the following scenarios:

- The VM instance type supports Ephemeral OS disks.
- The Ephemeral disk capacity is greater than or equal to the requested
`osDiskSizeGB`

. - The VM has sufficient ephemeral storage capacity.

If these conditions aren't met, the system falls back to using managed disks.

### Ephemeral disk types and prioritization

Azure VMs can have different types of ephemeral storage. The system uses the following priority order:

**NVMe disks**(highest performance)**Cache disks**(balanced performance)**Resource disks**(basic performance)

### Example ephemeral disk configuration

You can use node pool requirements to ensure nodes have sufficient ephemeral disk capacity, as shown in the following example:

```
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
name: ephemeral-disk-pool
spec:
template:
spec:
requirements:
- key: karpenter.azure.com/sku-storage-ephemeralos-maxsize
operator: Gt
values: ["128"] # Require ephemeral disk larger than 128 GB
nodeClassRef:
apiVersion: karpenter.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: AKSNodeClass
name: my-node-class
---
apiVersion: karpenter.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: AKSNodeClass
metadata:
name: my-node-class
spec:
osDiskSizeGB: 128 # This will use ephemeral disk if available and large enough
```


This configuration ensures that only VM instance types with ephemeral disks larger than 128 GB are selected, guaranteeing ephemeral disk usage for the specified OS disk size.

## Maximum pods configuration

The `maxPods`

field specifies the maximum number of pods that can be scheduled on a node. This setting affects both cluster density and network configuration.

The minimum value for `maxPods`

is 10, and the maximum value is 250.

### Default behavior for `maxPods`


The default behavior for `maxPods`

depends on the network plugin configuration. The following table summarizes the defaults:

| Network plugin configuration | Default `maxPods` per node |
|---|---|
| Azure CNI with standard networking (v1 or NodeSubnet) | 30 |
| Azure CNI with overlay networking | 250 |
| None (no network plugin) | 250 |
| Other configurations | 110 (standard Kubernetes default) |

### Example maximum pods configuration

```
spec:
maxPods: 50 # Allow up to 50 pods per node
```


## LocalDNS configuration

LocalDNS deploys a node level DNS proxy that resolves DNS queries closer to workloads, reducing query latency and improving resiliency during transient DNS disruptions. For more information, see the [LocalDNS documentation](localdns-custom). By default, LocalDNS is set to Disabled and can be configured to the following options:

`Disabled`

(default) - Disables the LocalDNS feature. DNS queries aren't resolved locally on the node.`Preferred`

- AKS manages LocalDNS enablement based on the Kubernetes version of the node pool. The configuration is always validated and included, but LocalDNS isn't enabled unless the correct Kubernetes version is used.`Required`

- LocalDNS is enforced on the node pool if all prerequisites are satisfied. If the requirements aren't met, the deployment fails.

### Example LocalDNS configuration

You can customize LocalDNS configurations such as `vnetDNSOverrides`

and `kubeDNSOverrides`

. For more details on the supported plugins, see [Customize LocalDNS](localdns-custom).

```
spec:
LocalDNS:
mode: Required
vnetDNSOverrides:
- zone: "."
cacheDuration: "30s"
forwardDestination: VnetDNS
forwardPolicy: Random
maxConcurrent: 80
protocol: ForceTCP
queryLogging: Log
serveStale: Immediate
serveStaleDuration: "100s"
- zone: "cluster.local"
cacheDuration: "40s"
forwardDestination: VnetDNS
forwardPolicy: Sequential
maxConcurrent: 70
protocol: PreferUDP
queryLogging: Error
serveStale: Disable

## Kubelet configuration

The `kubelet`

section allows you to configure various kubelet parameters that affect node behavior. These parameters are typical kubelet arguments, so the Azure provider simply passes them through to the kubelet on the node.

Important

**Configure kubelet settings carefully**, and test any changes in nonproduction environments first.

### CPU management

The following settings control CPU management behavior for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
cpuManagerPolicy: "static" # or "none"
cpuCFSQuota: true
cpuCFSQuotaPeriod: "100ms"
```


`cpuManagerPolicy`

: Controls how the kubelet allocates CPU resources. Set to`"static"`

for CPU pinning in latency-sensitive workloads.`cpuCFSQuota`

: Enables CPU Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota enforcement for containers that specify CPU limits.`cpuCFSQuotaPeriod`

: Sets the CPU CFS quota period.

### Image garbage collection

The following settings control image garbage collection behavior for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
imageGCHighThresholdPercent: 85
imageGCLowThresholdPercent: 80
```


These settings control when the kubelet performs garbage collection of container images:

`imageGCHighThresholdPercent`

: Disk usage percentage that triggers image garbage collection.`imageGCLowThresholdPercent`

: Target disk usage percentage after garbage collection.

### Topology management

The following setting controls the topology manager policy for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
topologyManagerPolicy: "best-effort" # none, restricted, best-effort, single-numa-node
```


The topology manager helps coordinate resource allocation for latency-sensitive workloads across CPU and device (like GPU) resources.

### System configuration

The following settings allow you to configure extra system parameters for the kubelet:

```
spec:
kubelet:
allowedUnsafeSysctls:
- "kernel.msg*"
- "net.ipv4.route.min_pmtu"
containerLogMaxSize: "50Mi"
containerLogMaxFiles: 5
podPidsLimit: 4096
```


`allowedUnsafeSysctls`

: List of permitted unsafe sysctls that pods can use.`containerLogMaxSize`

: Maximum size of container log files before rotation.`containerLogMaxFiles`

: Maximum number of container log files to retain.`podPidsLimit`

: Maximum number of processes allowed in any pod.

## Azure resource tags configuration

You can specify Azure resource tags that apply to all VM instances created using a particular `AKSNodeClass`

resource. Tags are useful for cost tracking, resource organization, and compliance requirements.

### Tag limitations

- Azure resource tags have a limit of 50 tags per resource.
- Tag names are case-insensitive but tag values are case-sensitive.
- Azure reserves some tag names that can't be used. For more information, see
[Tag guidance and limits](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources#tag-restrictions).

### Example tags configuration

```
spec:
tags:
Environment: "production"
Team: "platform"
Application: "web-service"
CostCenter: "engineering"
```

# Tutorial - Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for containerized applications. With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can quickly create a production ready Kubernetes cluster.

In this tutorial, you deploy a Kubernetes cluster in AKS. You learn how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, you created a container image and uploaded it to an ACR instance. Start with [Tutorial 1 - Prepare application for AKS](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app) to follow along.

- If you're using Azure CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with
`az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - If you're using Azure PowerShell, this tutorial requires that you're running Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Check your version with
`Get-InstalledModule -Name Az`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure PowerShell](/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). - If you're using Azure Developer CLI, this tutorial requires that you're running the Azure Developer CLI version 1.5.1 or later. Check your version with
`azd version`

. To install or upgrade, see[Install Azure Developer CLI](/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

## Create a Kubernetes cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. If a user is assigned multiple roles, permissions are combined. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster.

To learn more about AKS and Kubernetes RBAC, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra identities in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

This tutorial requires Azure CLI version 2.35.0 or later. Check your version with `az --version`

. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If you're using the Bash environment in Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Install the Kubernetes CLI

You use the Kubernetes CLI, [ kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed. If you're running the commands locally, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to install `kubectl`

.Install

`kubectl`

locally using thecommand.`az aks install-cli`

`az aks install-cli`


## Create an AKS cluster

AKS clusters can use [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/), which allows you to define access to resources based on roles assigned to users. Permissions are combined when users are assigned multiple roles. Permissions can be scoped to either a single namespace or across the whole cluster. For more information, see [Control access to cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC and Microsoft Entra ID in AKS](azure-ad-rbac).

For information about AKS resource limits and region availability, see [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in AKS](quotas-skus-regions).

Important

This tutorial creates a three-node cluster. To ensure your cluster operates reliably, you should run at least two nodes. A minimum of three nodes is required to use Azure Container Storage. If you get an error message when trying to create the cluster, then you might need to request a quota increase for your Azure subscription or try a different Azure region. Alternatively, you can omit the node VM size parameter to use the default VM size.

To allow an AKS cluster to interact with other Azure resources, the Azure platform automatically creates a cluster identity. In this example, the cluster identity is [granted the right to pull images](cluster-container-registry-integration) from the ACR instance you created in the previous tutorial. To execute the command successfully, you must have an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role in your Azure subscription.

Create an AKS cluster using the

command. The following example creates a cluster named`az aks create`

*myAKSCluster*in the resource group named*myResourceGroup*. This resource group was created in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr)in the*westus2*region. We'll continue to use the environment variable,`$ACRNAME`

, that we set in the[previous tutorial](tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr). If you don't have this environment variable set, set it now to the same value you used previously.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 3 \ --node-vm-size standard_l8s_v3 \ --generate-ssh-keys \ --attach-acr $ACRNAME`

Note

If you already generated SSH keys, you might encounter an error similar to

`linuxProfile.ssh.publicKeys.keyData is invalid`

. To proceed, retry the command without the`--generate-ssh-keys`

parameter.

To avoid needing an **Owner** or **Azure account administrator** role, you can also manually configure a service principal to pull images from ACR. For more information, see [ACR authentication with service principals](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal) or [Authenticate from Kubernetes with a pull secret](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-kubernetes). Alternatively, you can use a [managed identity](use-managed-identity) instead of a service principal for easier management.

## Connect to cluster using kubectl

Configure

`kubectl`

to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using thecommand. The following example gets credentials for the AKS cluster named`az aks get-credentials`

*myAKSCluster*in*myResourceGroup*.`az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster`

Verify connection to your cluster using the

command, which returns a list of cluster nodes.`kubectl get nodes`

`kubectl get nodes`

The following example output shows a list of the cluster nodes:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000000 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000001 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9 aks-nodepool1-19366578-vmss000002 Ready agent 47h v1.30.9`


## Next step

In this tutorial, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster in AKS and configured `kubectl`

to connect to the cluster. You learned how to:

- Deploy an AKS cluster that can authenticate to an ACR.
- Install the Kubernetes CLI,
`kubectl`

. - Configure
`kubectl`

to connect to your AKS cluster.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to deploy Azure Container Storage on your cluster and create a generic ephemeral volume. If you're using Azure Developer CLI, or if you weren't able to use a storage optimized VM type due to quota issues, proceed directly to the [Deploy containerized application](tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-application) tutorial.

# Uninstall the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to uninstall the OMS add-on and related resources from your AKS cluster.

Warning

Microsoft has announced the retirement of the [Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on for AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=open-service-mesh-add-on-for-aks-will-be-retired-on-september-30-2027). The upstream OSM project has also been retired by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/). Identify any existing OSM configurations and migrate them to equivalent Istio configurations. For migration steps, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance).

## Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster

Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster using the

# Operate cost-optimized Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at scale

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article provides guidance on how to operate cost optimized Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at scale.

## Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)

[Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager (Kubernetes Fleet)](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/overview) enables at-scale management of multiple AKS clusters. You can create a *Fleet resource* and use it to manage multiple clusters as a single entity, orchestrate updates across multiple clusters, and propagate Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters. When creating a new *Fleet resource*, you can create it with or without a *hub cluster*. A *hub cluster* is a managed AKS cluster that acts a hub to store and propagate Kubernetes resources.


Kubernetes Fleet can help you reduce the management overhead cost of operating multiple clusters by providing a single entry point for managing multiple clusters. For more information, see the [Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager documentation](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/).

### Resource propagation

Kubernetes Fleet provides *resource propagation* to enable at-scale management of Kubernetes resources. You can create Kubernetes resources in the *hub cluster* and propagate them to specified *member clusters* using the `MemberCluster`

and `ClusterResourcePlacement`

custom resources.


For more information, see [Kubernetes Fleet resource placement from hub cluster to member clusters](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/concepts-resource-propagation).

### Intelligent resource placement

Kubernetes Fleet provides *intelligent resource placement*, which can make scheduling decisions based on node count, cost of compute/memory in target member clusters, and resource availability in target member clusters. This allows you to place workloads in the most cost-effective member cluster based on your workload requirements.


For more information, see [Intelligent cross-cluster Kubernetes resource placement using Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager](/en-us/azure/kubernetes-fleet/intelligent-resource-placement).

## AKS Automatic

[AKS Automatic](intro-aks-automatic) offers an experience that makes the most common tasks on Kubernetes fast and frictionless, while preserving the flexibility, extensibility, and consistency of Kubernetes. Azure takes care of cluster setup, including node management, scaling, and security, and preconfigures settings that follow AKS well-architected recommendations.

AKS Automatic clusters are designed to help reduce management overhead costs of creating cluster templates, managing the cluster lifecycle, guardrails, and updates. Scaling is seamless and dynamic. Nodes are created based on workload requests using [node autoprovisioning (NAP)](node-autoprovision) and workloads are automatically scaled with features like Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), [Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)](keda-about), and [Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)](vertical-pod-autoscaler).

## Azure Advisor cost recommendations

AKS cost recommendations in Azure Advisor provide recommendations to help you achieve cost-efficiency without sacrificing reliability. Advisor analyzes your resource configurations and recommends optimization solutions. For more information, see [Get Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cost recommendations in Azure Advisor](cost-advisors).

# Use Deployment Safeguards to enforce best practices in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Deployment Safeguards to enforce best practices on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Overview

Note

Deployment Safeguards is turned on by default in AKS Automatic.

Throughout the development lifecycle, it is common for bugs, issues, and other problems to arise if the initial deployment of your Kubernetes resources includes misconfigurations. To ease the burden of Kubernetes development, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers Deployment Safeguards. Deployment Safeguards enforce Kubernetes best practices in your AKS cluster through Azure Policy controls.

Deployment Safeguards offer two levels of configuration:

`Warn`

: Displays warning messages in the code terminal to alert you of any noncompliant cluster configurations but still allows the request to go through.`Enforce`

: Enforces compliant configurations by denying and mutating deployments if they don't follow best practices.

After you configure Deployment Safeguards for 'Warn' or 'Enforce', Deployment Safeguards programmatically assess your Kubernetes resources at creation or update time for compliance. Deployment Safeguards also display aggregated compliance information across your workloads at a per resource level via Azure Policy's compliance dashboard in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade/%7E/Compliance) or in your CLI or terminal. Running a noncompliant workload indicates that your cluster is not following best practices and that workloads on your cluster are at risk of experiencing issues caused by your cluster configuration.

## Prerequisites

Note

Cluster admins don't need Azure Policy permissions to enable or disable Deployment Safeguards. However, it's required to have the Azure Policy add-on installed.

- You need to enable the Azure Policy add-on for AKS. For more information, see
[Enable Azure Policy on your AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks). This includes registering the`Microsoft.PolicyInsights`

resource provider in your subscription.

## Deployment Safeguards policies

The following table lists the policies that become active and the Kubernetes resources they target when you enable Deployment Safeguards. You can view the [currently available Deployment Safeguards](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/InitiativeDetail.ReactView/id/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2Fc047ea8e-9c78-49b2-958b-37e56d291a44/scopes/) in the Azure portal as an Azure Policy definition or at [Azure Policy built-in definitions for Azure Kubernetes Service](/en-us/azure/aks/policy-reference#policy-definitions). The intention behind this collection is to create a common and generic list of best practices applicable to most users and use cases.

| Deployment safeguard policy | Mutation outcome if available |
|---|---|
| Cannot Edit Individual Nodes | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster containers CPU and memory resource limits shouldn't exceed the specified limits | Sets CPU resource limits to 500m if not set and sets memory limits to 500Mi if no path is present |
| Must Have Anti Affinity Rules or topologySpreadConstraintsSet | N/A |
| No AKS Specific Labels | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster containers should only use allowed images | N/A |
| Reserved System Pool Taints | Removes the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint from a user node pool if not set. AKS uses the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint to keep customer pods away from the system pool. This configuration ensures a clear separation between AKS components and customer pods and prevents eviction of customer pods that don't tolerate the `CriticalAddonsOnly` taint. |
| Ensure cluster containers have readiness or liveness probes configured | N/A |
| Kubernetes clusters should use Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver StorageClass | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster services should use unique selectors | N/A |
| Kubernetes cluster container images should not include latest image tag | N/A |

If you want to submit an idea or request for Deployment Safeguards, open an issue in the [AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS) and add `[Deployment Safeguards request]`

to the beginning of the title.

## Pod Security Standards in Deployment Safeguards

Note

Baseline Pod Security Standards are now turned on by default in AKS Automatic. The baseline Pod Security Standards in AKS Automatic can't be turned off.

Deployment Safeguards also supports the ability to turn on [Baseline, Restricted and Privileged Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/). To ensure your workloads deploy successfully, make sure each manifest complies with the Baseline or Restricted Pod Security requirements. By default, Azure Kubernetes Service uses Privileged Pod Security Standards.

| Policy | Error Message | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| AppArmor | `AppArmor annotation values must be undefined/nil, runtime/default, or localhost/*` or `AppArmor profile type must be one of: undefined/nil, RuntimeDefault, or Localhost` |
Remove any specification of AppArmor. Kubernetes by default applies apparmor settings. "On supported hosts, the RuntimeDefault AppArmor profile is applied by default". |
| Host Namespaces | `Host network namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostNetwork is set to true'` or `'Host PID namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostPID is set to true'` or `'Host IPC namespaces are disallowed: spec.hostIPC is set to true'` |
Set those values to false, or remove specifying the fields. |
| Privileged Containers | `'Privileged [ephemeral\|init\|N/A] containers are disallowed: spec.containers[*].securityContext.privileged is set to true'` |
Set the appropriate securityContext.privileged field to false, or remove the field. |
| Capabilities | Message will start with `'Disallowed capabilities detected` |
Remove the capability shown from the container's manifest. |
| HostPath volumes | `HostPath volumes are forbidden under restricted security policy unless containers mounting them are from allowed images` |
Remove the HostPath volume and volume mount. |
| Host Ports | HostPorts are forbidden under baseline security policy | Remove the host port specification from the offending container. |
| SELinux | `SELinux type must be one of: undefined/empty, container_t, container_init_t, container_kvm_t, or container_engine_t` |
Set the container's securityContext.seLinuxOptions.type field to one of the allowed values. |
| /proc Mount Type | ProcMount must be undefined/nil or 'Default' in spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount | Set "* `spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount` " to 'Default' or have it be undefined. |
| Seccomp | `Seccomp profile must not be explicitly set to Unconfined. Allowed values are: undefined/nil, RuntimeDefault, or Localhost` |
Set `securityContext.seccompProfile.type` on the pod or containers to one of the allowed values. |
| Sysctls | `Disallowed sysctl detected. Only baseline Kubernetes pod security standard sysctls are permitted` |
Remove the disallowed systctls( see the
|

`Only the following volume types are allowed under restricted policy: configMap, csi, downwardAPI, emptyDir, ephemeral, persistentVolumeClaim, projected, secret`

`Privilege escalation must be set to false under restricted policy`

`* `

spec.containers[*].securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation`` must explicitly be set to false for each container, initContainer, and ephemeralContainer.`Containers must not run as root user in spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsNonRoot`

`'Containers must not run as root user: spec.securityContext.runAsUser is set to 0'`

`Seccomp profile must be "RuntimeDefault" or "Localhost" under restricted policy`

`securityContext.seccompProfile.type`

on the pod or containers to one of the allowed values. This differs from the baseline in the fact that the restricted policy doesn't allow an undefined value.`All containers must drop ALL capabilities under restricted policy`

or `Only NET_BIND_SERVICE may be added to capabilities under restricted policy`

## Enable Deployment Safeguards

Note

Using the Deployment Safeguards `Enforce`

level means you're opting in to deployments being blocked and mutated. Consider how these policies might work with your AKS cluster before enabling `Enforce`

.

### Enable Deployment Safeguards on an existing cluster

Enable Deployment Safeguards on an existing cluster that has the Azure Policy add-on enabled using the `az aks safeguard create`

command with the `--level`

flag. If you want to receive noncompliance warnings, set the `--level`

to `Warn`

. If you want to deny or mutate all noncompliant deployments, set it to `Enforce`

.

```
az aks safeguards create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Enforce
```


You can also enable Deployment Safeguards by using the `--cluster`

flag and specifying the cluster resource ID.

```
az aks safeguards create --cluster <ID> --level Enforce
```


If you want to update the Deployment Safeguards level of an existing cluster, run the following command with the new value for `--level`

.

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn
```


### Excluding namespaces

You can also exclude certain namespaces from Deployment Safeguards. When you exclude a namespace, activity in that namespace is unaffected by Deployment Safeguards warnings or enforcement.

For example, to exclude the namespaces `ns1`

and `ns2`

, use a space separated list of namespaces with the `--excluded-ns`

flag, as shown in the following example:

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn --excluded-ns ns1 ns2
```


### Turn on Pod Security Standards

Note

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses `Privileged`

Pod Security Standards by default. If you want to revert to the default configuration, set the `--pss-level`

flag to `Privileged`

.

To enable Pod Security Standards in Deployment Safeguards, use the `--pss-level`

flag to select one of the following levels: `Baseline`

, `Restricted`

, or `Privileged`

.

```
az aks safeguards update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name> --level Warn --pss-level <Baseline|Restricted|Privileged>
```


### Update your Deployment Safeguard version

Deployment Safeguards adhere to the [AKS addon versioning scheme](supported-kubernetes-versions). Each new version of a Deployment Safeguard will be released as a new minor version in AKS. These updates will be communicated through the [AKS GitHub release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) and reflected in the "Deployment Safeguards Policies" table in our documentation.

To learn more about AKS versioning and addons, refer to the following documentation: [aks-component-versions](supported-kubernetes-versions) and [aks-versioning-for-addons](integrations#add-ons).

## Verify compliance across clusters

After deploying your Kubernetes manifest, you see warnings or a potential denial message in your CLI or terminal if the cluster isn't compliant with Deployment Safeguards, as shown in the following examples:

**Warn**

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Warning: [azurepolicy-k8sazurev1antiaffinityrules-ceffa082711831ebffd1] Deployment with 2 replicas should have either podAntiAffinity or topologySpreadConstraints set to avoid disruptions due to nodes crashing
deployment.apps/simple-web created
```


**Enforce**

With Deployment Safeguard mutations, the `Enforce`

level mutates your Kubernetes resources when applicable. However, your Kubernetes resources still need to pass all safeguards to deploy successfully. If any safeguard policies fail, your resource is denied and won't be deployed.

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "deployment.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [azurepolicy-k8sazurev1antiaffinityrules-ceffa082711831ebffd1] Deployment with 2 replicas should have either podAntiAffinity or topologySpreadConstraints set to avoid disruptions due to nodes crashing
```


If your Kubernetes resources comply with the applicable mutation safeguards and meet all other safeguard requirements, they'll be successfully deployed, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/simple-web created
```


## Verify compliance across clusters using the Azure Policy dashboard

To verify Deployment Safeguards have been applied and to check on your cluster's compliance, navigate to the Azure portal page for your cluster and select **Policies**, then select **go to Azure Policy**.

From the list of policies and initiatives, select the initiative associated with Deployment Safeguards. You see a dashboard showing compliance state across your AKS cluster.

Note

To properly assess compliance across your AKS cluster, the Azure Policy initiative must be scoped to your cluster's resource group.

## Disable Deployment Safeguards

To disable Deployment Safeguards on your cluster, use the `delete`

command.

```
az aks safeguards delete --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>
```


## FAQ

#### Can I create my own mutations?

No. If you have an idea for a safeguard, open an issue in the [AKS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/AKS) and add `[Deployment Safeguards request]`

to the beginning of the title.

#### Can I pick and choose which mutations I want in Enforcement?

No. Deployment Safeguards is all or nothing. Once you turn on Warn or Enforce, all safeguards are active.

#### Why did my deployment resource get admitted even though it wasn't following best practices?

Deployment Safeguards enforce best practice standards through Azure Policy controls and has policies that validate against Kubernetes resources. To evaluate and enforce cluster components, Azure Policy extends [Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/). Gatekeeper enforcement also currently operates in a [ fail-open model](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/failing-closed/#considerations). As there's no guarantee that Gatekeeper responds to our networking call, we make sure that in that case, the validation is skipped so that the deny doesn't block your deployments.

To learn more, see [workload validation in Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/workload-resources/).

# Customize CoreDNS for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) for cluster DNS management and resolution with all *1.12.x* and higher clusters. AKS is a managed service, so you can't modify the main configuration for CoreDNS (a *CoreFile*). Instead, you use a Kubernetes *ConfigMap* to override the default settings. To see the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMaps, use the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

This article shows you how to use ConfigMaps for basic CoreDNS customization options in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Note

Previously, AKS used `kube-dns`

for cluster DNS management and resolution, but it's now deprecated. `kube-dns`

offered different [customization options](https://www.danielstechblog.io/using-custom-dns-server-for-domain-specific-name-resolution-with-azure-kubernetes-service/) via a Kubernetes config map. CoreDNS is **not** backwards compatible with `kube-dns`

. You must update any previous customizations to work with CoreDNS.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Verify the version of CoreDNS you're running. The configuration values might change between versions.

## Plugin support

All built-in CoreDNS plugins are supported. No add-on/third party plugins are supported.

Important

When you create configurations like the ones in this article, the names you specify in the `data`

section must end in `.server`

or `.override`

. This naming convention is defined in the default AKS CoreDNS ConfigMap, which you can view using the `kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns --output yaml`

command.

## Configure DNS name rewrites

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own fully qualified domain name (FQDN).`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { log errors rewrite stop { name regex (.*)\.<domain to be rewritten>\.com {1}.default.svc.cluster.local answer name (.*)\.default\.svc\.cluster\.local {1}.<domain to be rewritten>.com } forward . /etc/resolv.conf # You can redirect this to a specific DNS server such as 10.0.0.10, but that server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name }`

Important

If you redirect to a DNS server, such as the CoreDNS service IP, that DNS server must be able to resolve the rewritten domain name.

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Verify the customizations were applied using the

command.`kubectl get configmaps`

`kubectl get configmaps --namespace=kube-system coredns-custom -o yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Specify a forward server for your network traffic

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to replace the`forward`

name and`<domain to be rewritten>`

with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension <domain to be rewritten>.com:53 { forward foo.com 1.1.1.1 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Use custom domains

You might want to configure custom domains that can only be resolved internally. For example, you might want to resolve the custom domain *puglife.local*, which isn't a valid top-level domain. Without a custom domain ConfigMap, the AKS cluster can't resolve the address.

Create a new file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste in the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domain and IP address with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: puglife.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension puglife.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 192.11.0.1 # This is my test/dev DNS server }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Configure stub domains

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the custom domains and IP addresses with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom namespace: kube-system data: test.server: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .server file extension abc.com:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 1.2.3.4 } my.cluster.local:53 { errors cache 30 forward . 2.3.4.5 }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command and specify.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`


## Add custom host-to-IP mappings

Create a file named

`corednsms.yaml`

and paste the following example configuration. Make sure to update the IP addresses and hostnames with your own values.`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: coredns-custom # This is the name of the ConfigMap you can overwrite with your changes namespace: kube-system data: test.override: | # You can select any name here, but it must end with the .override file extension hosts { 10.0.0.1 example1.org 10.0.0.2 example2.org 10.0.0.3 example3.org fallthrough }`

Create the ConfigMap using the

command.`kubectl apply configmap`

`kubectl apply -f corednsms.yaml`

Perform a rolling restart to reload the ConfigMap and enable the Kubernetes Scheduler to restart CoreDNS without downtime using the

command.`kubectl rollout restart`

`kubectl --namespace kube-system rollout restart deployment coredns`

# Use a public standard load balancer in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

The [Azure Load Balancer](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model that supports both inbound and outbound scenarios. It distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to the back end pool instances.

A **public** load balancer integrated with AKS serves two purposes:

- Provide outbound connections to the cluster nodes inside the AKS virtual network (VNet) by translating the private IP address to a public IP address part of its
*outbound pool*. - Provide access to applications via Kubernetes services of type
`LoadBalancer`

, enabling you to easily scale your applications and create highly available services.

This article covers integration with a public load balancer on AKS. For internal load balancer integration, see [Use an internal load balancer in AKS](internal-lb).

## Prerequisites

- Azure Load Balancer is available in two SKUs:
*Basic*and*Standard*. The*Standard*SKU is used by default when you create an AKS cluster. The*Standard*SKU gives you access to added functionality, such as a larger backend pool,[multiple node pools](create-node-pools),[Availability Zones](availability-zones), and is[secure by default](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview#securebydefault). It's the recommended load balancer SKU for AKS. For more information on the*Basic*and*Standard*SKUs, see[Azure Load Balancer SKU comparison](/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus). - For a full list of the supported annotations for Kubernetes services with type
`LoadBalancer`

, see[LoadBalancer annotations](https://cloud-provider-azure.sigs.k8s.io/topics/loadbalancer/#loadbalancer-annotations). - This article assumes you have an AKS cluster with the
*Standard*SKU Azure Load Balancer. If you need an AKS cluster, you can create one using[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or[the Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal).

Important

If you'd prefer to use your own gateway, firewall, or proxy to provide outbound connection, you can skip the creation of the load balancer outbound pool and respective frontend IP by using [ outbound type as UserDefinedRouting (UDR)](egress-outboundtype). The outbound type defines the egress method for a cluster and defaults to type

`LoadBalancer`

.## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support a load balancer with the *Standard* SKU:

AKS manages the lifecycle and operations of agent nodes. Modifying the IaaS resources associated with the agent nodes isn't supported. An example of an unsupported operation is making manual changes to the load balancer resource group.

At least one public IP or IP prefix is required for allowing egress traffic from the AKS cluster. The public IP or IP prefix is required to maintain connectivity between the control plane and agent nodes and to maintain compatibility with previous versions of AKS. You have the following options for specifying public IPs or IP prefixes with a

*Standard*SKU load balancer:- Provide your own public IPs.
- Provide your own public IP prefixes.
- Specify a number up to 100 to allow the AKS cluster to create that many
*Standard*SKU public IPs in the same resource group as the AKS cluster. This resource group is usually named with`MC_`

at the beginning. AKS assigns the public IP to the*Standard*SKU load balancer. By default, one public IP is automatically created in the same resource group as the AKS cluster if no public IP, public IP prefix, or number of IPs is specified. You also must allow public addresses and avoid creating any Azure policies that ban IP creation.

A public IP created by AKS can't be reused as a custom bring your own (BYO) public IP address. You must create and manage all custom IP addresses.

You can only define the load balancer SKU when you create an AKS cluster. You can't change the load balancer SKU after an AKS cluster has been created.

You can only use one type of load balancer SKU (

*Basic*or*Standard*) in a single cluster.*Standard*SKU load balancers only support*Standard*SKU IP addresses.[Private Link Service](/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview)isn't supported when the load balancer backend pool type is set to`nodeIP`

.

## Create a load balancer service in AKS

After you create an AKS cluster with outbound type `LoadBalancer`

(default), your cluster is ready to use the load balancer to expose services.

Create a service manifest named

`public-svc.yaml`

, which creates a public service of type`LoadBalancer`

.`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: public-svc spec: type: LoadBalancer ports: - port: 80 selector: app: public-app`


## Specify the load balancer IP address

If you want to use a specific IP address with the load balancer, you have two options to specify the IP address:

**Set service annotations**(recommended): Use`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4`

for an IPv4 address and`service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6`

for an IPv6 address.**Add the**: Add the*LoadBalancerIP*property to the load balancer YAML manifest`Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`

property to the load balancer YAML manifest. This field is deprecating following[upstream Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), and it can't support dual-stack. Current usage remains the same and existing services are expected to work without modification.

## Deploy the load balancer service manifest

Deploy the public service manifest using

and specify the name of your YAML manifest.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f public-svc.yaml`

The Azure Load Balancer is configured with a new public IP that fronts the new service. Since the Azure Load Balancer can have multiple frontend IPs, each new service that you deploy gets a new dedicated frontend IP to be uniquely accessed.

Confirm your service is created and the load balancer is configured using the

`kubectl get service`

command.`kubectl get service public-svc`

When you view the service details, the public IP address created for this service on the load balancer is shown in the

*EXTERNAL-IP*column of the output. It might take a few minutes for the IP address to change from*<pending>*to an actual public IP address. The following example output shows successful creation of the service:`NAMESPACE NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE default public-svc LoadBalancer 10.0.39.110 203.0.113.187 80:32068/TCP 52s`

Get more detailed information about your service using the

`kubectl describe service`

command.`kubectl describe service public-svc`

The following example output is a condensed version of the output after you run

`kubectl describe service`

.*LoadBalancer Ingress*shows the external IP address exposed by your service.*IP*shows the internal addresses.`Name: public-svc Namespace: default Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Selector: app=public-app ... IP: 10.0.39.110 ... LoadBalancer Ingress: 203.0.113.187 ... TargetPort: 80/TCP NodePort: 32068/TCP ... Session Affinity: None External Traffic Policy: Cluster ...`
