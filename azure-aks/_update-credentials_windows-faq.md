Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

AKS clusters created with a service principal have a one-year expiration time. As you near the expiration date, you can reset the credentials to extend the service principal for an additional period of time. You might also want to update, or rotate, the credentials as part of a defined security policy. AKS clusters [integrated with Microsoft Entra ID](azure-ad-integration-cli) as an authentication provider have two more identities: the Microsoft Entra Server App and the Microsoft Entra Client App. This article details how to update the service principal and Microsoft Entra credentials for an AKS cluster.

Note

Alternatively, you can use a managed identity for permissions instead of a service principal. Managed identities don't require updates or rotations. For more information, see [Use managed identities](use-managed-identity).

## Before you begin

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.65 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Update or create a new service principal for your AKS cluster

When you want to update the credentials for an AKS cluster, you can choose to either:

- Update the credentials for the existing service principal.
- Create a new service principal and update the cluster to use these new credentials.

Warning

If you choose to create a *new* service principal, wait around 30 minutes for the service principal permission to propagate across all regions. Updating a large AKS cluster to use these credentials can take a long time to complete.

### Check the expiration date of your service principal

To check the expiration date of your service principal, use the [ az ad app credential list](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-list) command. The following example gets the service principal ID for the

`$CLUSTER_NAME`

cluster in the `$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

resource group using the [command. The service principal ID is set as a variable named](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show)

`az aks show`

*SP_ID*.

```
SP_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv)
az ad app credential list --id "$SP_ID" --query "[].endDateTime" -o tsv
```


### Reset the existing service principal credentials

To update the credentials for an existing service principal, get the service principal ID of your cluster using the [ az aks show](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show) command. The following example gets the ID for the

`$CLUSTER_NAME`

cluster in the `$RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`

resource group. The variable named *SP_ID*stores the service principal ID used in the next step. These commands use the Bash command language.

Warning

When you reset your cluster credentials on an AKS cluster that uses Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, a [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade) is performed to update your nodes with the new credential information.

```
SP_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv)
```


Use the variable *SP_ID* containing the service principal ID to reset the credentials using the [ az ad app credential reset](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/app/credential#az-ad-app-credential-reset) command. The following example enables the Azure platform to generate a new secure secret for the service principal and store it as a variable named

*SP_SECRET*.

```
SP_SECRET=$(az ad app credential reset --id "$SP_ID" --query password -o tsv)
```


Next, you [update AKS cluster with service principal credentials](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials). This step is necessary to update the service principal on your AKS cluster.

### Create a new service principal

Note

If you updated the existing service principal credentials in the previous section, skip this section and instead [update the AKS cluster with service principal credentials](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials).

To create a service principal and update the AKS cluster to use the new credential, use the [ az ad sp create-for-rbac](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command.

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```


The output is similar to the following example output. Make a note of your own `appId`

and `password`

to use in the next step.

```
{
"appId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"name": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"password": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
"tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```


Define variables for the service principal ID and client secret using your output from running the [ az ad sp create-for-rbac](/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command. The

*SP_ID*is the

*appId*, and the

*SP_SECRET*is your

*password*.

```
SP_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
SP_SECRET=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```


Next, you [update AKS cluster with the new service principal credential](#update-aks-cluster-with-service-principal-credentials). This step is necessary to update the AKS cluster with the new service principal credential.

## Update AKS cluster with service principal credentials

Important

For large clusters, updating your AKS cluster with a new service principal can take a long time to complete. Consider reviewing and customizing the [node surge upgrade settings](upgrade-aks-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) to minimize disruption during the update. For small and midsize clusters, it takes a several minutes for the new credentials to update in the cluster.

Update the AKS cluster with your new or existing credentials by running the [ az aks update-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update-credentials) command.

```
az aks update-credentials \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--reset-service-principal \
--service-principal "$SP_ID" \
--client-secret "${SP_SECRET}"
```


## Update AKS cluster with new Microsoft Entra application credentials

You can create new Microsoft Entra server and client applications by following the [Microsoft Entra integration steps](azure-ad-integration-cli#create-azure-ad-server-component), or reset your existing Microsoft Entra applications following the [same method as for service principal reset](#reset-the-existing-service-principal-credentials). After that, you need to update your cluster Microsoft Entra application credentials using the [ az aks update-credentials](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update-credentials) command with the

*--reset-aad*variables.

```
az aks update-credentials \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--reset-aad \
--aad-server-app-id $SERVER_APPLICATION_ID \
--aad-server-app-secret $SERVER_APPLICATION_SECRET \
--aad-client-app-id $CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID
```


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to update or rotate service principal and Microsoft Entra application credentials.

# Frequently asked questions about Windows Server on AKS

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about using Windows Server containers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Why can't I create new Windows Server 2019 node pools?

Windows Server 2019 isn't supported in Kubernetes version 1.33 and above. Use a supported Windows Server version such as Windows Server 2025 (preview) or Windows Server 2022.

## Why can't I upgrade my Windows Server 2019 node pools to Kubernetes version 1.33?

Windows Server 2019 isn't supported in Kubernetes version 1.33 and above. Use a supported Windows Server version such as Windows Server 2025 (preview) or Windows Server 2022.

## What kind of disks are supported for Windows?

Azure Disks and Azure Files are the supported volume types, and are accessed as New Technology File System (NTFS) volumes in the Windows Server container.

## Does Windows support generation 2 virtual machines (VMs)?

Generation 2 VMs are supported on Windows starting with Windows Server 2022. Generation 2 VMs are default in Windows Server 2025.

For more information, see [Support for generation 2 VMs on Azure](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/generation-2).

## How do I patch my Windows nodes?

To get the latest patches for Windows nodes, you can either [upgrade the node pool](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-single-node-pool) or [upgrade the node image](node-image-upgrade).

## Is preserving the client source IP supported?

At this time, [client source IP preservation](concepts-network-ingress#ingress-controllers) isn't supported with Windows nodes.

## Can I change the maximum number of pods per node?

Yes. For more information, see [Maximum number of pods](concepts-network-ip-address-planning#maximum-pods-per-node).

## What is the default transmission control protocol (TCP) time-out in Windows OS?

The default TCP time-out in Windows OS is four minutes. This value isn't configurable. When an application uses a longer time-out, the TCP connections between different containers in the same node close after four minutes.

## Why am I seeing an error when I try to create a new Windows agent pool?

If you created your cluster before February 2020 and didn't perform any upgrade operations, the cluster still uses an old Windows image. You might see an error that resembles the following example:

"The following list of images referenced from the deployment template isn't found: Publisher: MicrosoftWindowsServer, Offer: WindowsServer, Sku: 2019-datacenter-core-smalldisk-2004, Version: latest. Refer to [Find and use Azure Marketplace Virtual Machine images with Azure PowerShell](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/cli-ps-findimage) for instructions on finding available images."

To fix this issue, you need to perform the following steps:

- Upgrade the
[cluster control plane](manage-node-pools#upgrade-a-cluster-control-plane-with-multiple-node-pools), which updates the image offer and publisher. - Create new Windows agent pools.
- Move Windows pods from existing Windows agent pools to new Windows agent pools.
- Delete old Windows agent pools.

## Why am I seeing an error when I try to deploy Windows pods?

If you specify a value in `--max-pods`

less than the number of pods you want to create, you might see the `No available addresses`

error.

To fix this error, use the `az aks nodepool add`

command with a high enough `--max-pods`

value. For example:

```
az aks nodepool add \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $NODEPOOL_NAME \
--max-pods 3
```


For more details, see the [ --max-pods documentation](/en-us/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-add).

## Why is there an unexpected user named "sshd" on my virtual machine node?

AKS adds a user named "sshd" when installing the OpenSSH service. This user isn't malicious. We recommend that customers update their alerts to ignore this unexpected user account.

## How do I rotate the service principal for my Windows node pool?

Windows node pools don't support service principal rotation. To update the service principal, create a new Windows node pool and migrate your pods from the older pool to the new one. After your pods are migrated to the new pool, delete the older node pool.

Instead of service principals, you can use managed identities. For more information, see [Use managed identities in AKS](use-managed-identity).

## How do I change the administrator password for Windows Server nodes on my cluster?

To change the administrator password using the Azure CLI, use the `az aks update`

command with the `--admin-password`

parameter. For example:

```
az aks update \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--admin-password <new-password>
```


To change the password using Azure PowerShell, use the `Set-AzAksCluster`

cmdlet with the `-AdminPassword`

parameter. For example:

```
Set-AzAksCluster `
-ResourceGroupName $RESOURCE_GROUP `
-Name $CLUSTER_NAME `
-AdminPassword <new-password>
```


Keep in mind that performing a cluster update causes a restart and only updates the Windows Server node pools. For information about Windows Server password requirements, see [Windows Server password requirements](/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements#reference).

## How many node pools can I create?

AKS clusters with Windows node pools have the same resource limits as the default limits specified for the AKS service. For more information, see [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](quotas-skus-regions).

## Can I run ingress controllers on Windows nodes?

Yes, you can run ingress controllers that support Windows Server containers.

## Can my Windows Server containers use gMSA?

Yes. Group-managed service account (gMSA) support is generally available (GA) for Windows on AKS. For more information, see [Enable Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for your Windows Server nodes on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-group-managed-service-accounts)

## Are there any limitations on the number of services on a cluster with Windows nodes?

A cluster with Windows nodes can have approximately 500 services (sometimes less) before it encounters port exhaustion. This limitation applies to a Kubernetes Service with External Traffic Policy set to "Cluster".

When the external traffic policy on a Service is configured as a Cluster, the traffic undergoes an extra Source NAT on the node. This process also results in reservation of a port from the TCPIP dynamic port pool. This port pool is a limited resource (~16K ports by default) and many active connections to a Service can lead to dynamic port pool exhaustion resulting in connection drops.

If the Kubernetes Service is configured with External Traffic Policy set to "Local", port exhaustion problems aren't likely to occur at 500 services.

## How do I change the time zone of a running container?

To change the time zone of a running Windows Server container, connect to the running container with a PowerShell session. For example:

```
kubectl exec -it CONTAINER-NAME -- PowerShell
```


In the running container, use [Set-TimeZone](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-timezone) to set the time zone of the running container. For example:

```
Set-TimeZone -Id "Russian Standard Time"
```


To see the current time zone of the running container or an available list of time zones, use [Get-TimeZone](/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-timezone).
