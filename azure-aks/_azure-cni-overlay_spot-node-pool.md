Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article explains the setup process, dual-stack networking configuration, and an example workload deployment for Azure CNI Overlay in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. For an overview of Azure CNI Overlay networking, see [Overview of Azure CNI Overlay networking in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-network-azure-cni-overlay).

Important

As of **November 30, 2025**, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) no longer supports or provides security updates for Azure Linux 2.0. The Azure Linux 2.0 node image is frozen at the [202512.06.0 release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AgentBaker/main/vhdbuilder/release-notes/AKSCBLMarinerV2/gen2/202512.06.0.txt). Beginning **March 31, 2026**, node images will be removed, and you'll be unable to scale your node pools. Migrate to a supported Azure Linux version by [upgrading your node pools](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-cluster) to a supported Kubernetes version or migrating to [osSku AzureLinux3](/en-us/azure/aks/upgrade-os-version). For more information, see [[Retirement] Azure Linux 2.0 node pools on AKS](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4988).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)before you begin. - Azure CLI version 2.48.0 or later. To install or upgrade the Azure CLI, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - An existing Azure resource group. If you need to create one, see
[Create resource groups](/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli#create-resource-groups).

For dual-stack networking, you need Kubernetes version 1.26.3 or later.

## Key parameters for Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters

The following table describes the key parameters for configuring Azure CNI Overlay networking in AKS clusters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`--network-plugin` |
Set to `azure` to use Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) networking. |
`--network-plugin-mode` |
Set to `overlay` to enable Azure CNI Overlay networking. This setting applies only when `--network-plugin=azure` . |
`--pod-cidr` |
Specify a custom pod Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block for the cluster. The default is `10.244.0.0/16` . |

The default behavior for network plugins depends on whether you explicitly set `--network-plugin`

:

- If you don't specify
`--network-plugin`

, AKS defaults to Azure CNI Overlay. - If you specify
`--network-plugin=azure`

and omit`--network-plugin-mode`

, AKS intentionally uses virtual network (node subnet) mode for backward compatibility.

## Create an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster

Create an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster by using the [ az aks create](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) command with

`--network-plugin=azure`

and `--network-plugin-mode=overlay`

. If you don't specify a value for `--pod-cidr`

, AKS assigns the default value of `10.244.0.0/16`

.```
az aks create \
--name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--location $REGION \
--network-plugin azure \
--network-plugin-mode overlay \
--pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
--generate-ssh-keys
```


## Add a new node pool to a dedicated subnet

Add a node pool to a different subnet within the same virtual network to control virtual machine (VM) node IP addresses for network traffic to virtual network or peered virtual network resources.

Add a new node pool to the cluster by using the [ az aks nodepool add](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az_aks_nodepool_add) command and specify the subnet resource ID with the

`--vnet-subnet-id`

parameter. For example:```
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
--name $NODE_POOL_NAME \
--node-count 1 \
--mode system \
--vnet-subnet-id $SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID
```


## About Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters with dual-stack networking

You can deploy your Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters in a dual-stack mode with an Azure virtual network. In this configuration, nodes receive both an IPv4 and IPv6 address from the Azure virtual network subnet. Pods receive an IPv4 and IPv6 address from a different address space to the Azure virtual network subnet of the nodes. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured so that the pods can reach resources on the Azure virtual network. The source IP address of the traffic is NAT'd to the node's primary IP address of the same family (*IPv4 to IPv4* and *IPv6 to IPv6*).

Note

You can also deploy dual-stack networking clusters by using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium. For more information, see [Dual-stack networking with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](azure-cni-powered-by-cilium#dual-stack-networking-with-azure-cni-powered-by-cilium).

## Dual-stack networking limitations

The following features aren't supported with dual-stack networking:

## Key parameters for dual-stack networking

The following table describes the key parameters for configuring dual-stack networking in Azure CNI Overlay AKS clusters:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
`--ip-families` |
Takes a comma-separated list of IP families to enable on the cluster. Only `ipv4` and `ipv4,ipv6` are supported. |
`--pod-cidrs` |
Takes a comma-separated list of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation IP ranges to assign pod IPs from. The count and order of ranges in this list must match the value provided to `--ip-families` . If you don't supply any values, the parameter uses the default value of `10.244.0.0/16,fd12:3456:789a::/64` . |
`--service-cidrs` |
Takes a comma-separated list of CIDR notation IP ranges to assign service IPs from. The count and order of ranges in this list must match the value provided to `--ip-families` . If you don't supply any values, the parameter uses the default value of `10.0.0.0/16,fd12:3456:789a:1::/108` . The IPv6 subnet assigned to `--service-cidrs` can be no larger than `/108` . |

## Create an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster with dual-stack networking (Linux)

Create an Azure resource group for the cluster by using the

command:`az group create`

`az group create --location $REGION --name $RESOURCE_GROUP`

Create a dual-stack AKS cluster by using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--ip-families`

parameter set to`ipv4,ipv6`

:`az aks create \ --location $REGION \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --ip-families ipv4,ipv6 \ --generate-ssh-keys`


## Create an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster with dual-stack networking (Windows)

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

Before you create an Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster with dual-stack networking with Windows node pools, you need to install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension and register the `AzureOverlayDualStackPreview`

feature flag in your subscription.

### Install the `aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

extension by using thecommand:`az extension add`

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension by using the

command:`az extension update`

`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register the `AzureOverlayDualStackPreview`

feature flag

Register the

`AzureOverlayDualStackPreview`

feature flag by using thecommand:`az feature register`

`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureOverlayDualStackPreview"`

It takes a few minutes for the status to show

`Registered`

.Verify the registration status by using the

command:`az feature show`

`az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureOverlayDualStackPreview"`

When the status reflects

`Registered`

, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider by using thecommand:`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


### Create a dual-stack Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster and add a Windows node pool

Create a cluster with Azure CNI Overlay by using the

command:`az aks create`

`az aks create \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --location $REGION \ --network-plugin azure \ --network-plugin-mode overlay \ --ip-families ipv4,ipv6 \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Add a Windows node pool to the cluster by using the

command:`az aks nodepool add`

`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --os-type Windows \ --name $WINDOWS_NODE_POOL_NAME \ --node-count 2`


## Deploy an example workload to the Azure CNI Overlay AKS cluster

Deploy dual-stack AKS CNI Overlay clusters with IPv4/IPv6 addresses on virtual machine nodes. This example deploys an NGINX web server and exposes it by using a `LoadBalancer`

service with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Note

We recommend using the application routing add-on for ingress in AKS clusters. However, for demonstration purposes, this example deploys an NGINX web server without the application routing add-on. For more information about the add-on, see [Managed NGINX ingress with the application routing add-on](app-routing).

### Expose the workload by using a `LoadBalancer`

service

Expose the NGINX deployment by using either `kubectl`

commands or YAML manifests.

Important

There are currently *two limitations* that pertain to IPv6 services in AKS:

- Azure Load Balancer sends health probes to IPv6 destinations from a link-local address. In
*Azure Linux node pools*, you can't route this traffic to a pod, so traffic flowing to IPv6 services deployed with`externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster`

fails. - You must deploy IPv6 services with
`externalTrafficPolicy: Local`

, which causes`kube-proxy`

to respond to the probe on the node.

Expose the NGINX deployment by using the

`kubectl expose deployment nginx`

command:`kubectl expose deployment nginx --name=nginx-ipv4 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer kubectl expose deployment nginx --name=nginx-ipv6 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer --overrides='{"spec":{"ipFamilies": ["IPv6"]}}'`

Your output should show the exposed services. For example:

`service/nginx-ipv4 exposed service/nginx-ipv6 exposed`

After the deployment is exposed and the

`LoadBalancer`

services are fully provisioned, get the IP addresses of the services by using the`kubectl get services`

command:`kubectl get services`

Your output should show the services with their assigned IP addresses. For example:

`NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx-ipv4 LoadBalancer 10.0.88.78 20.46.24.24 80:30652/TCP 97s nginx-ipv6 LoadBalancer fd12:3456:789a:1::981a 2603:1030:8:5::2d 80:32002/TCP 63s`

Get the service IP by using the

`kubectl get services`

command and set it to an environment variable:`SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get services nginx-ipv6 -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')`

Verify functionality by using a

`curl`

request from an IPv6-capable host. (*Azure Cloud Shell isn't IPv6 capable*.)`curl -s "http://[${SERVICE_IP}]" | head -n5`

Your output should show the HTML for the NGINX welcome page. For example:

`<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Welcome to nginx!</title> <style>`

# Add an Azure Spot node pool to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you add a secondary Spot node pool to an existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

A Spot node pool is a node pool backed by an [Azure Spot Virtual Machine scale set](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot). With Spot VMs in your AKS cluster, you can take advantage of unutilized Azure capacity with significant cost savings. The amount of available unutilized capacity varies based on many factors, such as node size, region, and time of day.

When you deploy a Spot node pool, Azure allocates the Spot nodes if there's capacity available and deploys a Spot scale set that backs the Spot node pool in a single default domain. There's no SLA for the Spot nodes. There are no high availability guarantees. If Azure needs capacity back, the Azure infrastructure evicts the Spot nodes.

Spot nodes are great for workloads that can handle interruptions, early terminations, or evictions. For example, workloads such as batch processing jobs, development and testing environments, and large compute workloads might be good candidates to schedule on a Spot node pool.

## Before you begin

- This article assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes and Azure Load Balancer concepts. For more information, see
[Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](concepts-clusters-workloads). - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a
[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)before you begin. - When you create a cluster to use a Spot node pool, the cluster must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets for node pools and the
*Standard*SKU load balancer. You must also add another node pool after you create your cluster, which is covered in this tutorial. - This article requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.14 or later. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters with a Spot node pool:

- A Spot node pool can't be a default node pool, it can only be used as a secondary pool.
- You can't upgrade the control plane and node pools at the same time. You must upgrade them separately or remove the Spot node pool to upgrade the control plane and remaining node pools at the same time.
- A Spot node pool must use Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
- You can't change
`ScaleSetPriority`

or`SpotMaxPrice`

after creation. - When setting
`SpotMaxPrice`

, the value must be*-1*or a*positive value with up to five decimal places*. - A Spot node pool has the
`kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority:spot`

label, the`kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule`

taint, and the system pods have anti-affinity. - You must add a
[corresponding toleration](#verify-the-spot-node-pool)and affinity to schedule workloads on a Spot node pool.

## Add a Spot node pool to an AKS cluster

When adding a Spot node pool to an existing cluster, it must be a cluster with multiple node pools enabled. When you create an AKS cluster with multiple node pools enabled, you create a node pool with a `priority`

of `Regular`

by default. To add a Spot node pool, you must specify `Spot`

as the value for `priority`

. For more details on creating an AKS cluster with multiple node pools, see [use multiple node pools](create-node-pools).

- Create a node pool with a
`priority`

of`Spot`

using thecommand.`az aks nodepool add`


```
export SPOT_NODEPOOL="spotnodepool"
az aks nodepool add \
--resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
--cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER \
--name $SPOT_NODEPOOL \
--priority Spot \
--eviction-policy Delete \
--spot-max-price -1 \
--enable-cluster-autoscaler \
--min-count 1 \
--max-count 3 \
--no-wait
```


In the previous command, the `priority`

of `Spot`

makes the node pool a Spot node pool. The `eviction-policy`

parameter is set to `Delete`

, which is the default value. When you set the [eviction policy](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot#eviction-policy) to `Delete`

, nodes in the underlying scale set of the node pool are deleted when they're evicted.

You can also set the eviction policy to `Deallocate`

, which means that the nodes in the underlying scale set are set to the *stopped-deallocated* state upon eviction. Nodes in the *stopped-deallocated* state count against your compute quota and can cause issues with cluster scaling or upgrading. The `priority`

and `eviction-policy`

values can only be set during node pool creation. Those values can't be updated later.

The previous command also enables the [cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler), which we recommend using with Spot node pools. Based on the workloads running in your cluster, the cluster autoscaler scales the number of nodes up and down. For Spot node pools, the cluster autoscaler will scale up the number of nodes after an eviction if more nodes are still needed. If you change the maximum number of nodes a node pool can have, you also need to adjust the `maxCount`

value associated with the cluster autoscaler. If you don't use a cluster autoscaler, upon eviction, the Spot pool will eventually decrease to *0* and require manual operation to receive any additional Spot nodes.

Important

Only schedule workloads on Spot node pools that can handle interruptions, such as batch processing jobs and testing environments. We recommend you set up [taints and tolerations](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler#provide-dedicated-nodes-using-taints-and-tolerations) on your Spot node pool to ensure that only workloads that can handle node evictions are scheduled on a Spot node pool. For example, the above command adds a taint of `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule`

, so only pods with a corresponding toleration are scheduled on this node.

## Verify the Spot node pool

- Verify your node pool was added using the
command and confirming the`az aks nodepool show`

`scaleSetPriority`

is`Spot`

.

```
az aks nodepool show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER --name $SPOT_NODEPOOL
```

## Schedule a pod to run on the Spot node

To schedule a pod to run on a Spot node, you can add a toleration and node affinity that corresponds to the taint applied to your Spot node.

The following example shows a portion of a YAML file that defines a toleration corresponding to the `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot:NoSchedule`

taint and a node affinity corresponding to the `kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority=spot`

label used in the previous step with `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

and `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

node affinity rules:

```
spec:
containers:
- name: spot-example
tolerations:
- key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
operator: "Equal"
value: "spot"
effect: "NoSchedule"
affinity:
nodeAffinity:
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
nodeSelectorTerms:
- matchExpressions:
- key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
operator: In
values:
- "spot"
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 1
preference:
matchExpressions:
- key: another-node-label-key
operator: In
values:
- another-node-label-value
```


When you deploy a pod with this toleration and node affinity, Kubernetes successfully schedules the pod on the nodes with the taint and label applied. In this example, the following rules apply:

- The node
*must*have a label with the key`kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority`

, and the value of that label*must*be`spot`

. - The node
*preferably*has a label with the key`another-node-label-key`

, and the value of that label*must*be`another-node-label-value`

.

For more information, see [Assigning pods to nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

## Upgrade a Spot node pool

When you upgrade a Spot node pool, AKS internally issues a cordon and an eviction notice, but no drain is applied. There are no surge nodes available for Spot node pool upgrades. Outside of these changes, the behavior when upgrading Spot node pools is consistent with that of other node pool types.

For more information on upgrading, see [Upgrade an AKS cluster](upgrade-cluster).

## Max price for a Spot pool

[Pricing for Spot instances is variable](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/use-spot#pricing), based on region and SKU. For more information, see pricing information for [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machine-scale-sets/linux/) and [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machine-scale-sets/windows/).

With variable pricing, you have the option to set a max price, in US dollars (USD) using up to five decimal places. For example, the value *0.98765* would be a max price of *$0.98765 USD per hour*. If you set the max price to *-1*, the instance won't be evicted based on price. As long as there's capacity and quota available, the price for the instance will be the lower price of either the current price for a Spot instance or for a standard instance.
