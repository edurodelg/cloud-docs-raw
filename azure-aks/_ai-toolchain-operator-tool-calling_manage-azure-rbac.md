Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you configure and deploy an AI toolchain operator (KAITO) inference workspace on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with support for OpenAI-style tool calling. You also learn how to validate tool calling functionality using vLLM metrics and local function mocks.

## What is tool calling?

Tool calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interface with external functions, APIs, or services. Instead of just generating text, an LLM can decide:

- "I need to call a weather API."
- "I need to use a calculator."
- "I should search a database."

It does this by invoking a defined “tool” with parameters it chooses based on the user’s request. Tool calling is useful for:

- Chatbots that book, summarize, or calculate.
- Enterprise LLM applications where hallucination must be minimized.
- Agent frameworks (AutoGen, LangGraph, LangChain, AgentOps, etc.).

In production environments, AI-enabled applications often demand more than natural language generation; they require the ability to take action based on user intent. Tool calling empowers LLMs to extend beyond text responses by invoking external tools, APIs, or custom logic in real time. This bridges the gap between language understanding and execution, enabling developers to build interactive AI assistants, agents, and automation workflows that are both accurate and useful. Instead of relying on static responses, LLMs can now access live data, trigger services, and complete tasks on behalf of users, both safely and reliably.

When deployed on AKS, tool calling becomes scalable, secure, and production ready. Kubernetes provides the flexibility to orchestrate inference workloads using high-performance runtimes like vLLM, while ensuring observability and governance of tool usage. With this pattern, AKS operators and app developers can more seamlessly update models or tools independently and deploy advanced AI features without compromising reliability.

As a result, tool calling on AKS is now a foundational pattern for building modern AI apps that are context-aware, action-capable, and enterprise-ready.

### Tool calling with KAITO

To streamline this deployment model, the AI toolchain operator (KAITO) add-on for AKS provides a managed solution for running inference services with [tool calling support](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/). By leveraging KAITO inference workspaces, you can quickly spin up scalable, GPU-accelerated model endpoints with built-in support for tool calling and OpenAI-compatible APIs. This eliminates the operational overhead of configuring runtimes, managing dependencies, or scaling infrastructure manually.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one by using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Your AKS cluster is running on Kubernetes version
`1.33`

or higher. To upgrade your cluster, see[Upgrade your AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster). - Install and configure Azure CLI version
`2.77.0`

or later. To find your version, run`az --version`

. To install or update, see[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - The
[AI toolchain operator add-on enabled](ai-toolchain-operator)on your cluster. - A deployed KAITO inference workspace that supports tool calling. Refer to the official
[KAITO tool calling](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/)documentation for the tool calling supported models with vLLM. - You deployed the
`workspace‑phi‑4-mini-toolcall`

[KAITO workspace](https://github.com/kaito-project/kaito/blob/main/examples/inference/kaito_workspace_tool_calling.yaml)with the default configuration.

## Confirm the KAITO inference workspace is running

Monitor your workspace deployment with the

`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get workspace workspace‑phi‑4‑mini-toolcall -w`

In the output, you want to verify the resource (

`ResourceReady`

) and inference (`InferenceReady`

) are ready and the workspace succeeded (`WorkspaceSucceeded`

being`true`

).

## Confirm the inference API is ready to serve

Once the

[workspace is ready](#confirm-the-kaito-inference-workspace-is-running), find the service endpoint using the`kubectl get`

command.`kubectl get svc workspace‑phi‑4-mini-toolcall`

Note

The output might be a

`ClusterIP`

or internal address. Check which port(s) the service listens on. The default KAITO inference API is on port`80`

for HTTP. If it's only internal, you can port‑forward locally.Port-forward the inference service for testing using the

`kubectl port-forward`

command.`kubectl port-forward svc/workspace‑phi‑4‑mini-toolcall 8000:80`

Check the

`/v1/models`

endpoint to confirm the LLM is available using`curl`

.`curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models`

To ensure the LLM is deployed, and the API is working, your output should be similar to the following:

`... { "object": "list", "data": [ { "id": "phi‑4‑mini‑instruct", ... ... } ] } ...`


## Test the named function tool‐calling

In this example, the `workspace‑phi‑4‑mini-toolcall`

workspace supports named function tool-calling by default, so we can confirm the LLM accepts a “tool” spec in OpenAI‑style requests and returns a “function call” structure.

The Python snippet we use in this section is from the [KAITO documentation](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/#examples) and uses an OpenAI‑compatible client.

Confirm the LLM accepts a “tool” spec in OpenAI‑style requests and returns a “function call” structure. This example:

- Initializes the OpenAI-compatible client to talk to a local inference server. The server is assumed to be running at
`http://localhost:8000/v1`

and accepts OpenAI-style API calls. - Simulates the backend logic for a tool called
`get_weather`

. (In a real scenario, this would call a weather API.) - Describes the tool interface; the
`Phi-4-mini`

LLM will see this tool and decide whether to use it based on the user's input. - Sends a sample chat message to the model and provides the tool spec. The setting
`tool_choice="auto"`

allows the LLM to decide if it should call a tool based on the prompt. - In this case, the user's request was relevant to the
`get_weather`

tool, so we simulate the execution of the tool, calling the local function with the model's chosen arguments.

`from openai import OpenAI import json # local server client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy") def get_weather(location: str, unit: str) -> str: return f"Getting the weather for {location} in {unit}..." tool_functions = {"get_weather": get_weather} tools = [{ "type": "function", "function": { "name": "get_weather", "description": "Get the current weather in a given location", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "location": {"type": "string"}, "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]} }, "required": ["location", "unit"] } } }] response = client.chat.completions.create( model="phi‑4‑mini‑instruct", # or client.models.list().data[0].id messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"}], tools=tools, tool_choice="auto" ) # Inspect response tool_call = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function args = json.loads(tool_call.arguments) print("Function called:", tool_call.name) print("Arguments:", args) print("Result:", tool_functions[tool_call.name](**args))`

Your output should look similar to the following:

`Function called: get_weather Arguments: {"location": "San Francisco, CA", "unit": "fahrenheit"} Result: Getting the weather for San Francisco, CA in fahrenheit...`

The “tool_calls” field comes back, meaning the

`Phi-4-mini`

LLM decided to invoke the function. Now, a sample tool call has been successfully parsed and executed based on the model’s decision to confirm end-to-end tool calling behavior with the KAITO inference deployment.- Initializes the OpenAI-compatible client to talk to a local inference server. The server is assumed to be running at

## Troubleshooting

### Model preset doesn’t support tool calling

If you pick a model that isn't on the supported list, tool calling might not work. Make sure you [review the KAITO documentation](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/), which explicitly lists which presets support tool calling.

### Misaligned runtime

The KAITO inference must use [vLLM runtime for tool calling](https://kaito-project.github.io/kaito/docs/tool-calling/#supported-inference-runtimes) (HuggingFace Transformers runtime generally doesn’t support tool calling in KAITO).

### Network / endpoint issues

If port-forwarding, ensure the service ports are correctly forwarded. If the external MCP server is unreachable, will error out.

### Timeouts

External MCP server calls might take time. Make sure the adapter or client timeout is sufficiently high.

### Authentication

If the external MCP server requires authentication (API key, header, etc.), ensure you supply correct credentials.

## Next steps

- Set up
[vLLM monitoring in the AI toolchain operator add-on](ai-toolchain-operator-monitoring)with Prometheus and Grafana on AKS. - Learn about
[MCP server support with KAITO](ai-toolchain-operator-mcp)and test standardized tool calling examples on your AKS cluster.

# Use Azure role-based access control for Kubernetes Authorization

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article covers how to use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization, which allows for the unified management and access control across Azure resources, AKS, and Kubernetes resources. For more information, see [Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization](/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-rbac-for-kubernetes-authorization).

Note

When using [integrated authentication between Microsoft Entra ID and AKS](managed-azure-ad), you can use Microsoft Entra users, groups, or service principals as subjects in [Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC)](/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-identity#azure-rbac-for-kubernetes-authorization). With this feature, you don't need to separately manage user identities and credentials for Kubernetes. However, you still need to set up and manage Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC separately.

## Before you begin

- You need the Azure CLI version 2.24.0 or later installed and configured. Run
`az --version`

to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). - You need
`kubectl`

, with a minimum version of[1.18.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1183). - You need managed Microsoft Entra integration enabled on your cluster before you can add Azure RBAC for Kubernetes authorization. If you need to enable managed Microsoft Entra integration, see
[Use Microsoft Entra ID in AKS](managed-azure-ad). - If you have CRDs and are making custom role definitions, the only way to cover CRDs today is to use
`Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/*/read`

. For the remaining objects, you can use the specific API groups, such as`Microsoft.ContainerService/apps/deployments/read`

. - New role assignments can take
*up to five minutes*to propagate and be updated by the authorization server. - Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization requires that the Microsoft Entra tenant configured for authentication is same as the tenant for the subscription that holds your AKS cluster.

## Create a new AKS cluster with managed Microsoft Entra integration and Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization

Create an Azure resource group using the

command.`az group create`

`export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name> export LOCATION=<azure-region> az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION`

Create an AKS cluster with managed Microsoft Entra integration and Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization using the

command.`az aks create`

`export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster-name> az aks create \ --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \ --name $CLUSTER_NAME \ --enable-aad \ --enable-azure-rbac \ --generate-ssh-keys`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`"AADProfile": { "adminGroupObjectIds": null, "clientAppId": null, "enableAzureRbac": true, "managed": true, "serverAppId": null, "serverAppSecret": null, "tenantId": "****-****-****-****-****" }`


## Enable Azure RBAC on an existing AKS cluster

Enable Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization on an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--enable-azure-rbac`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-azure-rbac`


## Disable Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization from an AKS cluster

Remove Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization from an existing AKS cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-azure-rbac`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --disable-azure-rbac`


## AKS built-in roles

AKS provides the following built-in roles:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader | Allows read-only access to see most objects in a namespace. It doesn't allow viewing roles or role bindings. This role doesn't allow viewing `Secrets` , since reading the contents of Secrets enables access to ServiceAccount credentials in the namespace, which would allow API access as any ServiceAccount in the namespace (a form of privilege escalation). |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer | Allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace. This role doesn't allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing `Secrets` and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin | Allows admin access, intended to be granted within a namespace. Allows read/write access to most resources in a namespace (or cluster scope), including the ability to create roles and role bindings within the namespace. This role doesn't allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace itself. |
| Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Cluster Admin | Allows super-user access to perform any action on any resource. It gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. |

## Create role assignments for cluster access

Get your AKS resource ID using the

command.`az aks show`

`AKS_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --query id --output tsv)`

Create a role assignment using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`<AAD-ENTITY-ID>`

can be a username or the client ID of a service principal. The following example creates a role assignment for the*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin*role.`az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID`

Note

You can create the

*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader*and*Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Writer*role assignments scoped to a specific namespace within the cluster using thecommand and setting the scope to the desired namespace.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID/namespaces/<namespace-name>`


## Create custom roles definitions

The following example custom role definition allows a user to only read deployments and nothing else. For the full list of possible actions, see [Microsoft.ContainerService operations](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations#microsoftcontainerservice).

To create your own custom role definitions, copy the following file, replacing

`<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>`

with your own subscription ID, and then save it as`deploy-view.json`

.`{ "Name": "AKS Deployment Reader", "Description": "Lets you view all deployments in cluster/namespace.", "Actions": [], "NotActions": [], "DataActions": [ "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/apps/deployments/read" ], "NotDataActions": [], "assignableScopes": [ "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>" ] }`

Create the role definition using the

command, setting the`az role definition create`

`--role-definition`

to the`deploy-view.json`

file you created in the previous step.`az role definition create --role-definition @deploy-view.json`

Assign the role definition to a user or other identity using the

command.`az role assignment create`

`az role assignment create --role "AKS Deployment Reader" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID`


## Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization with `kubectl`


Make sure you have the

[Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-user-role)built-in role, and then get the kubeconfig of your AKS cluster using thecommand.`az aks get-credentials`

`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`

You can now use

`kubectl`

to manage your cluster. For example, you can list the nodes in your cluster using`kubectl get nodes`

.`kubectl get nodes`

Example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11`


## Use Azure RBAC for Kubernetes Authorization with `kubelogin`


AKS created the [ kubelogin](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) plugin to help unblock scenarios such as non-interactive logins, older

`kubectl`

versions, or leveraging SSO across multiple clusters without the need to sign in to a new cluster.Use the

`kubelogin`

plugin by running the following command:`export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig kubelogin convert-kubeconfig`

You can now use

`kubectl`

to manage your cluster. For example, you can list the nodes in your cluster using`kubectl get nodes`

.`kubectl get nodes`

Example output:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000000 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000001 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11 aks-nodepool1-93451573-vmss000002 Ready agent 3h6m v1.15.11`


## Clean up resources

### Delete role assignment

List role assignments using the

command.`az role assignment list`

`az role assignment list --scope $AKS_ID --query [].id --output tsv`

Delete role assignments using the

command.`az role assignment delete`

`az role assignment delete --ids <LIST OF ASSIGNMENT IDS>`


### Delete role definition

Delete the custom role definition using the

command.`az role definition delete`

`az role definition delete --name "AKS Deployment Reader"`


### Delete resource group and AKS cluster

Delete the resource group and AKS cluster using the

command.`az group delete`

`az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes --no-wait`
