Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Cluster extensions provide an Azure Resource Manager driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of services like Azure Machine Learning or Kubernetes applications on an AKS cluster. This feature enables:

- Azure Resource Manager-based deployment of extensions, including at-scale deployments across AKS clusters.
- Lifecycle management of the extension (Update, Delete) from Azure Resource Manager.

## Categories of cluster extensions

There are two categories of cluster extensions, *Core* and *Standard* that can be deployed onto AKS clusters.

### Core extensions

Core Kubernetes extensions have broader region availability, a more integrated AKS experience, and release alignment to AKS version releases. Azure Backup is a core extension.

#### AKS native experience

Core extensions can be managed using `az aks`

CLI command.

```
az aks extension create \
--name <core extension name> \
--extension-type <type> \
--cluster-name <name> \
--resource-group <group>
```


For more information about the commands, see [ az aks](/en-us/cli/azure/aks).

#### Release policy

Minor and major upgrades of core extensions occur alongside AKS minor and major version updates to avoid introducing breaking changes and provide better reliability.

### Standard extensions

For information about the other cluster extensions, see the table in [Currently available extensions](cluster-extensions#currently-available-extensions) and the [Kubernetes apps](deploy-marketplace) deployed via Azure Marketplace are of the Standard Extension type.

Standard extensions can be managed using the `az k8s-extension`

CLI command. For more information, see [Deploy and manage cluster extensions by using Azure CLI](deploy-extensions-az-cli).

```
az k8s-extension create \
--name <standard extension name> \
--extension-type <extension-type> \
--scope cluster \
--cluster-name <clusterName> \
--resource-group <resourceGroupName> \
--cluster-type managedClusters
```


## Cluster extension requirements

The cluster extensions platform is supported in all regions where AKS is deployed, except Qatar Central and US air gapped clouds. Although the platform is available in all regions, check the region availability for individual extensions.

Important

Ensure that your AKS cluster is created with a managed identity, as cluster extensions don't work with service principal-based clusters.

For new clusters created with `az aks create`

, managed identity is configured by default. For existing service principal-based clusters that need to be switched over to managed identity, it can be enabled by running `az aks update`

with the `--enable-managed-identity`

flag. For more information, see [Use managed identity](use-managed-identity).

Note

If you enabled [Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity](use-azure-ad-pod-identity) on your AKS cluster or are considering implementing it,
we recommend you first review [Workload identity overview](workload-identity-overview) to understand our
recommendations and options to set up your cluster to use a Microsoft Entra Workload ID (preview).
This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (preview), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities
to federate with any external identity providers.
The open source Microsoft Entra pod-managed identity (preview) in Azure Kubernetes Service was deprecated as of October 24, 2022.

## Currently available extensions

| Extension | Description |
|---|---|
|

`Dapr`

is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that run on cloud and edge.[Azure App Configuration](azure-app-configuration-quickstart)[Azure Machine Learning](/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere)[Flux (GitOps)](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-gitops-flux2)[supported versions of Flux (GitOps)](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/extensions-release#flux-gitops)and[Tutorial: Deploy applications using GitOps with Flux v2](/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/tutorial-use-gitops-flux2).[Azure Container Storage](/en-us/azure/storage/container-storage/container-storage-introduction)[Azure Backup for AKS](/en-us/azure/backup/azure-kubernetes-service-backup-overview)You can also [select and deploy Kubernetes applications available through Marketplace](deploy-marketplace).

Note

Cluster extensions provide a platform for different extensions to be installed and managed on an AKS cluster. If you're facing issues while using any of these extensions, open a support ticket with the respective service.

# Cluster operator and developer best practices to build and manage applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Building and running applications successfully in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) requires understanding and implementation of some key concepts, including:

- Multi-tenancy and scheduler features.
- Cluster and pod security.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery.

The AKS product group, engineering teams, and field teams (including global black belts (GBBs)) contributed to, wrote, and grouped the following best practices and conceptual articles. Their purpose is to help cluster operators and developers better understand the concepts above and implement the appropriate features.

## Cluster operator best practices

If you're a cluster operator, work with application owners and developers to understand their needs. Then, you can use the following best practices to configure your AKS clusters to fit your needs.

An important practice that you should include as part of your application development and deployment process is remembering to follow commonly used deployment and testing patterns. Testing your application before deployment is an important step to ensure its quality, functionality, and compatibility with the target environment. It can help you identify and fix any errors, bugs, or issues that might affect the performance, security, or usability of the application or underlying infrastructure.

### Multi-tenancy

[Best practices for cluster isolation](operator-best-practices-cluster-isolation)- Includes multi-tenancy core components and logical isolation with namespaces.

[Best practices for basic scheduler features](operator-best-practices-scheduler)- Includes using resource quotas and pod disruption budgets.

[Best practices for advanced scheduler features](operator-best-practices-advanced-scheduler)- Includes using taints and tolerations, node selectors and affinity, and inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity.

[Best practices for authentication and authorization](operator-best-practices-identity)- Includes integration with Microsoft Entra ID, using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC), using Azure RBAC, and pod identities.


### Security

[Best practices for cluster security and upgrades](operator-best-practices-cluster-security)- Includes securing access to the API server, limiting container access, and managing upgrades and node reboots.

[Best practices for container image management and security](operator-best-practices-container-image-management)- Includes securing the image and runtimes and automated builds on base image updates.

[Best practices for pod security](developer-best-practices-pod-security)- Includes securing access to resources, limiting credential exposure, and using pod identities and digital key vaults.


### Network and storage

[Best practices for network connectivity](operator-best-practices-network)- Includes different network models, using ingress and web application firewalls (WAF), and securing node SSH access.

[Best practices for storage and backups](operator-best-practices-storage)- Includes choosing the appropriate storage type and node size, dynamically provisioning volumes, and data backups.


### Running enterprise-ready workloads

[Best practices for business continuity and disaster recovery](operator-best-practices-multi-region)- Includes using region pairs, multiple clusters with Azure Traffic Manager, and geo-replication of container images.


## Developer best practices

If you're a developer or application owner, you can simplify your development experience and define required application performance features.

[Best practices for application developers to manage resources](developer-best-practices-resource-management)- Includes defining pod resource requests and limits, configuring development tools, and checking for application issues.

[Best practices for pod security](developer-best-practices-pod-security)- Includes securing access to resources, limiting credential exposure, and using pod identities and digital key vaults.

[Best practices for deployment and cluster reliability](best-practices-app-cluster-reliability)- Includes deployment, cluster, and node pool level best practices.


## Kubernetes and AKS concepts

The following conceptual articles cover some of the fundamental features and components for clusters in AKS:

[Kubernetes core concepts](concepts-clusters-workloads)[Access and identity](concepts-identity)[Security concepts](concepts-security)[Network concepts](concepts-network)[Storage options](concepts-storage)[Scaling options](concepts-scale)

# Use Virtual Machines node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you'll learn about the new Virtual Machines node pool type for AKS.

With Virtual Machines node pools, AKS directly manages the provisioning and bootstrapping of every single node. For Virtual Machine Scale Sets node pools, AKS manages the model of the Virtual Machine Scale Sets and uses it to achieve consistency across all nodes in the node pool. Virtual Machines node pools enable you to orchestrate your cluster with virtual machines that best fit your individual workloads.

## Overview

### How it works

A node pool consists of a set of virtual machines, where different virtual machine sizes are designated to support different types of workloads. These virtual machine sizes, referred to as SKUs, are categorized into different families that are optimized for specific purposes. For more information, see [VM SKUs](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview).

To enable scaling of multiple virtual machine sizes, the Virtual Machines node pool type uses a `ScaleProfile`

that contains configurations indicating how the node pool can scale, specifically the desired list of virtual machine size and the count of each size. A `ManualScaleProfile`

is a scale profile that specifies one desired virtual machine size and the total count of that type in the nodepool. Only one virtual machine size is allowed in a `ManualScaleProfile`

. You need to create a separate `ManualScaleProfile`

for each virtual machine size in your node pool. When creating a new Virtual Machines node pool, you add an initial manual scale profile for a virtual machine size using the `vm-size`

field and including a `node-count`

, per the instructions below. You can also add additional manual scale profiles following the instructions for [adding manual scale profiles](/en-us/azure/aks/virtual-machines-node-pools#add-a-manual-scale-profile-to-a-node-pool).

Note

When creating a new Virtual Machines node pool, you can have multiple scale profiles, and you need at least one manual scale profile in your nodepool.

### Advantages

Advantages of the Virtual Machines node pool type include:

**Flexibility**: Node specifications can be updated to adapt to your current workload and needs.**Fine-tuned control**: Single node-level controls allow specifying and mixing nodes of different specs to lift restrictions from a single model and improve consistency.**Efficiency**: You can reduce the node footprint for your cluster, simplifying your operational requirements.

Virtual Machines node pools provide a better experience for dynamic workloads and high availability requirements. Virtual Machines node pools enable you to set up multiple similar-family virtual machines in one node pool. Your workload will be automatically scheduled on the available resources that you configure.

### Feature comparison

The following table highlights how Virtual Machines node pools compare with standard [Scale Set](/en-us/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes) node pools.

| Node pool type | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Virtual Machines node pool | You can add, remove, or update nodes in a node pool. Virtual machine types can be any virtual machine of the same family type (for example, D-series, A-Series, etc.). |
| Virtual Machine Scale Set based node pool | You can add or remove nodes of the same size and type in a node pool. If you add a new virtual machine size to the cluster, you need to create a new node pool. |

### Limitations

[Cluster autoscaler](cluster-autoscaler-overview)is currently not supported.[InifiniBand](/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/enable-infiniband)isn't available.[Node pool snapshot](node-pool-snapshot)isn't supported.- All VM sizes selected in a node pool need to be from a similar virtual machine family. For example, you can't mix an N-Series virtual machine type with a D-Series virtual machine type in the same node pool.
- Virtual Machines node pools allow up to five different virtual machine sizes per node pool.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can
[create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). - Azure CLI version 2.73.0 or later installed and configured. To find the version, run
`az --version`

. For more information about installing or upgrading the Azure CLI, see[Install Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli#install-azure-cli) - This feature requires kubernetes version 1.27 or greater. To upgrade your kubernetes version, see
[Upgrade AKS cluster](upgrade-aks-cluster)

## Create an AKS cluster with Virtual Machines node pools

Note

Only *one* VM size is allowed in a scale profile, and the maximum limit is *five* VM scale profiles overall for a Virtual Machines node pool.

Create an AKS cluster with Virtual Machines node pools using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.The following example creates a cluster named

*myAKSCluster*with a Virtual Machines node pool containing two nodes, generates SSH keys, sets the load balancer SKU to*standard*, and sets the Kubernetes version to*1.31.0*:`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" --node-count 2 \ --kubernetes-version 1.31.0`


## Create a cluster with Windows enabled and a Windows Virtual Machine node pool

Virtual Machine node pools are available in Windows enabled clusters. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with a Virtual Machines node pool. These steps create a Linux system pool at first.

Create a username to use as administrator credentials for the Windows Server nodes on your cluster. The following commands prompt you for a username and sets it to

*WINDOWS_USERNAME*for use in a later command.`echo "Please enter the username to use as administrator credentials for Windows Server nodes on your cluster: " && read WINDOWS_USERNAME`

Create a password for the administrator username you created in the previous step. The password must be a minimum of 14 characters and meet the

[Windows Server password complexity requirements](/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/password-must-meet-complexity-requirements#reference).`echo "Please enter the password to use as administrator credentials for Windows Server nodes on your cluster: " && read WINDOWS_PASSWORD`

Create an AKS cluster with Windows enabled and Virtual Machines type node pools using the

command with the`az aks create`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.`az aks create \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --name myAKSCluster \ --node-count 2 \ --enable-addons monitoring \ --generate-ssh-keys \ --windows-admin-username $WINDOWS_USERNAME \ --windows-admin-password $WINDOWS_PASSWORD \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --network-plugin azure`

Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing Windows enabled cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

. The following example adds a Virtual Machines node pool named*npwin*to the*myAKSCluster*cluster:`az aks nodepool add --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --os-type Windows \ --name npwin \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D2s_V3" \ --node-count 1 --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines"`


## Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing cluster

Add a Virtual Machines node pool to an existing cluster using the

command with the`az aks nodepool add`

`--vm-set-type`

flag set to`"VirtualMachines"`

.The following example adds a Virtual Machines node pool named

*myvmpool*to the*myAKSCluster*cluster. The node pool creates a ManualScaleProfile with`--vm-sizes`

set to*Standard_D4s_v3*and a`--node-count`

of 3:`az aks nodepool add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --vm-set-type "VirtualMachines" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" \ --node-count 3`


## Add a manual scale profile to a node pool

Add a manual scale profile to a node pool using the

with the`az aks nodepool manual-scale add`

`--vm-sizes`

flag set to`"Standard_D2s_v3"`

and the`node-count`

set to 2.The following example adds a manual scale profile to node pool

*myvmpool*in cluster*myAKSCluster*. The node pool includes two nodes with a VM SKU of*Standard_D2s_v3*:`az aks nodepool manual-scale add \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D2s_v3" \ --node-count 2`


## Update an existing manual scale profile

Update an existing manual scale profile in a node pool using the

command with the`az aks nodepool manual-scale update`

`--vm-sizes`

flag set to`"Standard_D2s_v3"`

.Note

Use the

`--current-vm-sizes`

parameter to specify the size of the existing node pool that you want to update. You can update`--vm-sizes`

and/or`--node-count`

. When using other tools or REST APIs, you need to pass in a full`agentPoolProfiles.virtualMachinesProfile.scale`

field when updating the node pool scale profile.The following example updates a manual scale profile to the

*myvmpool*node pool in the*myAKSCluster*cluster. The command updates the number of nodes to five and changes the VM SKU from*Standard_D4s_v3*to*Standard_D8s_v3*:`az aks nodepool manual-scale update \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --current-vm-sizes "Standard_D4s_v3" \ --vm-sizes "Standard_D8s_v3" \ --node-count 5`


## Delete a manual scale profile

Delete an existing manual scale profile using the

command.`az aks nodepool manual-scale delete`

Note

The

`--current-vm-sizes`

parameter specifies the size of the existing node pool to be deleted. When using other tools or REST APIs to update the node pool scale profile, pass in a full`agentPoolProfiles.virtualMachinesProfile.scale`

field.The following example deletes the manual scale profile for the

*Standard_D8s_v3*VM SKU in the*myvmpool*node pool.`az aks nodepool manual-scale delete \ --resource-group myResourceGroup \ --cluster-name myAKSCluster \ --name myvmpool \ --current-vm-sizes "Standard_D8s_v3"`

# Use Kubernetes events for troubleshooting in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

This article shows you how to use Kubernetes events to monitor and troubleshoot issues in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## What are Kubernetes events?

Events are one of the most prominent sources for monitoring and troubleshooting issues in Kubernetes. They capture and record information about the lifecycle of various Kubernetes objects, such as pods, nodes, services, and deployments. By monitoring events, you can gain visibility into your cluster's activities, identify issues, and troubleshoot problems effectively.

Kubernetes events don't persist throughout your cluster lifecycle, as there's no retention mechanism. Events are **only available for one hour after the event is generated**. To store events for a longer time period, enable

[Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks).

## Kubernetes event objects

The following table lists some key Kubernetes event objects:

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| type | The type is based on the severity of the event:Warning events signal potentially problematic situations, such as a pod repeatedly failing or a node running out of resources. They require attention, but might not result in immediate failure.Normal events represent routine operations, such as a pod being scheduled or a deployment scaling up. They usually indicate healthy cluster behavior. |
| reason | The reason why the event was generated. For example, FailedScheduling or CrashLoopBackoff. |
| message | A human-readable message that describes the event. |
| namespace | The namespace of the Kubernetes object that the event is associated with. |
| firstSeen | Timestamp when the event was first observed. |
| lastSeen | Timestamp of when the event was last observed. |
| reportingController | The name of the controller that reported the event. For example, `kubernetes.io/kubelet` . |
| object | The name of the Kubernetes object that the event is associated with. |

For more information, see the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/).

## View Kubernetes events

List all events in your cluster using the `kubectl get events`

command.

Assuming your cluster is already created and available (per doc prerequisites), get credentials (note the `--overwrite-existing`

flag is set to avoid kubeconfig errors):

```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER --overwrite-existing
```


Now list all events in your cluster:

```
kubectl get events
```


Results:

```
LAST SEEN TYPE REASON OBJECT MESSAGE
xxm Normal Scheduled pod/my-pod-xxxxx Successfully assigned default/my-pod-xxxxx to aks-nodepoolxx-xxxxxxx-vmss000000
xxm Normal Pulled pod/my-pod-xxxxx Container image "nginx" already present on machine
xxm Normal Created pod/my-pod-xxxxx Created container nginx
xxm Normal Started pod/my-pod-xxxxx Started container nginx
...
```


Look at a specific pod's events by first finding the name of the pod and then using the `kubectl describe pod`

command.

List the pods in the current namespace:

```
kubectl get pods
```


Results:

```
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-pod-xxxxx 1/1 Running 0 xxm
nginx-deployment-xxxxx 1/1 Running 0 xxm
...
```


Replace `<pod-name>`

below with your actual pod name. For automation, here's an example for the first pod in the list:

```
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl describe pod $POD_NAME
```


## Best practices for troubleshooting with events

### Filtering events for relevance

You might have various namespaces and services running in your AKS cluster. Filtering events based on object type, namespace, or reason can help narrow down the results to the most relevant information.

For example, you can use the following command to filter events within the default namespace:

```
kubectl get events --namespace default
```


### Automating event notifications

To ensure timely response to critical events in your AKS cluster, set up automated notifications. Azure offers integration with monitoring and alerting services like [Azure Monitor](monitor-aks). You can configure alerts to trigger based on specific event patterns. This way, you're immediately informed about crucial issues that require attention.

### Regularly reviewing events

Make a habit of regularly reviewing events in your AKS cluster. This proactive approach can help you identify trends, catch potential problems early, and prevent escalations. By staying on top of events, you can maintain the stability and performance of your applications.

## Next steps

Now that you understand Kubernetes events, you can continue your monitoring and observability journey by [enabling Container insights](/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks).

# Quickstart: Generate ConfigMap from Azure App Configuration

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

You can externalize the configurations of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads and manage them in [Azure App Configuration](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/overview). The [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/artifact/mar/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) runs as a container in your cluster. Key benefits include:

**Seamless integration**: Pulls data from Azure App Configuration and Key Vault, making them accessible as ConfigMap and Secret without code changes in your workloads.**Dynamic update**: Built-in caching and refreshing capabilities for dynamic configuration, feature flagging, and automatic secret rotation.

The Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider is available as an AKS extension. By following this document, you can easily install the extension and connect your AKS cluster with an App Configuration store using the Service Connector in the Azure portal. For information on setting up the provider using Helm, see the [Quickstart for Azure App Configuration Kubernetes provider](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
[Create an AKS cluster](/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster). - A running workload in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. If you don't have one, you can
[create a demo application running in AKS](/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-azure-kubernetes-service#create-an-application-running-in-aks).

## Create a service connection to App Configuration

Create a service connection between your AKS cluster and your App Configuration store using Microsoft Entra Workload Identity.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource.Select

**Settings**>**Service Connector**>**Create**.On the

**Basics**tab, configure the following settings:**Kubernetes namespace**: Specify the namespace you'd like to create ConfigMap or Secret to.**Service type**: Select**App Configuration**.**Use App Configuration Extension on Kubernetes**: Check the box to use the[Azure App Configuration AKS extension](azure-app-configuration)for this connection. Azure App Configuration AKS extension will be installed to current cluster if it's not yet.**Connection name**: Enter a connection name or use the default name.**Subscription**: Select the subscription of your App Configuration store.**App Configuration**: Select your App Configuration store. If you don't have one, click**Create new**to set one up.

Select

**Next: Authentication**. On the**Authentication**tab, keep the default selection of**Workload Identity**, select a**User assigned managed identity**you want to use. If you don't have one, click**Create new**to set one up.Select

**Next: Networking**and use the default settings.Select

**Next: Review + create**and wait for the validation to pass.Select

**Create**to create the service connection.

Note

The Service Connector simplifies the installation of the Azure App Configuration AKS extension from the Azure portal. You can also install it without Service Connector using Azure CLI, Bicep, or an ARM template. For more information, see [Install Azure App Configuration AKS extension](azure-app-configuration).

## Generate ConfigMap from App Configuration

Update the service connection to create and deploy an `AzureAppConfigurationProvider`

YAML resource in your AKS cluster. This resource generates a ConfigMap with data from your App Configuration store.

In the

[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your AKS cluster resource and select**Settings**>**Service Connector**.Select the newly created connection, select

**Yaml snippet**in the top menu.On the

**AzureAppConfigurationProvider**tab, configure the following settings:**Using configuration as**: Choose to consume the configuration as a**mounted file**or**environment variables**.**Mounted file**: If selected, specify the**file type**and**file name**.**Selector**: Set the**Key filter**and**Label filter**to load data from your App Configuration store.

A YAML is generated based on your input. Click

**Apply**to add it to your AKS cluster. It will create a ConfigMap in your AKS cluster with data from your App Configuration store.Click

**Next**. On the**Workload**tab, configure the following settings:**File mount path**: Specify the file mount path if the mounted file option was selected.**Kubernetes Workload**: Select the workload where the generated ConfigMap will be injected.- Click

[create a certificate](#create-and-export-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate).Azure DNS if you want to configure global and private zone management and host them in Azure. If you don't have an Azure DNS zone, you can

[create one](#create-a-global-azure-dns-zone). To enable support for DNS zones:- All global Azure DNS zones need to be in the same resource group, which could be different from the cluster resource group.
- All private Azure DNS zones need to be in the same resource group, which could be different from the cluster resource group.
- The resource group doesn't need to be in the same subscription as the cluster.


### Required Azure permissions

**Your user account needs**: [Owner](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Azure account administrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles), or [Azure co-administrator](/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#classic-subscription-administrator-roles) role on your Azure subscription.

**What the commands do**: When you run `az aks approuting update --attach-kv`

or `az aks approuting zone add --attach-zones`

, these commands use your role assignment permissions to automatically grant the application routing add-on's managed identity the following roles:

**Key Vault Certificate User**role on your Azure Key Vault (for certificate access).**DNS Zone Contributor**role on your Azure DNS zones (for DNS record management).

For more information on AKS managed identities, see [Summary of managed identities](managed-identity-overview#summary-of-managed-identities-used-by-aks).

## Connect to your AKS cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your local computer, you use `kubectl`

, the Kubernetes command-line client. You can install it locally using the [ az aks install-cli](/en-us/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command. If you use the Azure Cloud Shell,

`kubectl`

is already installed.Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the

command.`az aks get-credentials`

`# Set environment variables for your resource group and cluster name export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name> export CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster-name> # Get the AKS cluster credentials az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME`


## Create and export a self-signed SSL certificate

For testing, you can use a self-signed public certificate instead of a Certificate Authority (CA)-signed certificate. If you already have a certificate, you can skip this step.

Caution

Self-signed certificates are digital certificates that aren't signed by a trusted third-party CA. The company or developer responsible for the website or software creates, issues, and signs these certificates. This is why self-signed certificates are considered unsafe for public-facing websites and applications. Azure Key Vault has a [trusted partnership with the some Certificate Authorities](/en-us/azure/key-vault/certificates/how-to-integrate-certificate-authority).

Create a self-signed SSL certificate to use with the ingress using the

`openssl req`

command. Make sure you replacewith the DNS name you're using.`<host-name>`

`openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out aks-ingress-tls.crt -keyout aks-ingress-tls.key -subj "/CN=<host-name>" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:<host-name>"`

Export the SSL certificate and skip the password prompt using the

`openssl pkcs12 -export`

command.`openssl pkcs12 -export -in aks-ingress-tls.crt -inkey aks-ingress-tls.key -out aks-ingress-tls.pfx`


## Import a self-signed SSL certificate into Azure Key Vault

Import the SSL certificate into Azure Key Vault using the

command. If your certificate is password protected, you can pass the password through the`az keyvault certificate import`

`--password`

flag.`# Set environment variables for your key vault name and certificate name export KEY_VAULT_NAME=<key-vault-name> export KEY_VAULT_CERT_NAME=<key-vault-certificate-name> # Import the SSL certificate into Azure Key Vault az keyvault certificate import --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --name $KEY_VAULT_CERT_NAME --file aks-ingress-tls.pfx [--password <certificate password if specified>]`


Note

To enable the application routing add-on to reload certificates from Azure Key Vault when they change, you should enable the [secret autorotation feature](csi-secrets-store-configuration-options#manage-auto-rotation) of the Secrets Store CSI driver. When autorotation is enabled, the driver updates the pod mount and the Kubernetes secret by polling for changes periodically, based on the rotation poll interval you define. The default rotation poll interval is two minutes.

## Enable Azure Key Vault integration

Azure Key Vault offers [two authorization systems](/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy): **Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)**, which operates on the management plane, and the **access policy model**, which operates on both the management plane and the data plane. The `--attach-kv`

operation selects the appropriate access model to use.

Get the resource ID for the key vault using the

command and set the output to an environment variable.`az keyvault show`

`KEY_VAULT_ID=$(az keyvault show --name <KeyVaultName> --query "id" --output tsv)`

Update the application routing add-on to enable the Azure Key Vault provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver and apply the required role assignments using the

command with the`az aks approuting update`

`--enable-kv`

and`--attach-kv`

arguments.`az aks approuting update --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-kv --attach-kv ${KEY_VAULT_ID}`


## Create a global Azure DNS zone

If you already have an Azure DNS zone, you can skip this step.

Create an Azure DNS zone using the

command.`az network dns zone create`

`# Set environment variables for your resource group and DNS zone name export RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group-name> export ZONE_NAME=<zone-name> # Create the Azure DNS zone az network dns zone create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $ZONE_NAME`


## Enable Azure DNS integration

Get the resource ID for the DNS zone using the

command and set the output to an environment variable.`az network dns zone show`

`ZONE_ID=$(az network dns zone show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $ZONE_NAME --query "id" --output tsv)`

Update the application routing add-on to enable Azure DNS integration using the

command. You can pass a comma-separated list of DNS zone resource IDs.`az aks approuting zone`

`az aks approuting zone add --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME --ids=${ZONE_ID} --attach-zones`


## Create an Ingress class that uses a host name and a certificate from Azure Key Vault

The application routing add-on creates an Ingress class on the cluster named *webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com*. When you create an Ingress object with this class, it activates the add-on.

Get the certificate URI to use in the ingress from Azure Key Vault using the

command.`az keyvault certificate show`

`az keyvault certificate show --vault-name $KEY_VAULT_NAME --name $KEY_VAULT_CERT_NAME --query "id" --output tsv`

The following example output shows the certificate URI returned from the command:

`https://KeyVaultName.vault.azure.net/certificates/KeyVaultCertificateName/ab12c34567d89e01f2345g6h78ijkl90`

Copy the following YAML manifest into a new file named

**ingress.yaml**and save the file to your local computer.Update

with the name of your DNS host and`<host-name>`

with the URI returned from the previous command. The string value for`<key-vault-certificate-uri>`

should only include`<key-vault-certificate-uri>`

`https://yourkeyvault.vault.azure.net/certificates/certname`

. Remove the*Certificate Version*at the end of the URI string to get the current version.The

key in the`secretName`

`tls`

section defines the name of the secret that contains the certificate for this Ingress resource. This certificate is presented in the browser when a client browses to the URL specified in the`<host-name>`

key. Make sure that the value of`secretName`

is equal to`keyvault-`

followed by the value of the Ingress resource name (from`metadata.name`

). In the example YAML,`secretName`

needs to be equal to`keyvault-<your-ingress-name>`

.`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: annotations: kubernetes.azure.com/tls-cert-keyvault-uri: <key-vault-certificate-uri> name: aks-helloworld namespace: hello-web-app-routing spec: ingressClassName: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com rules: - host: <host-name> http: paths: - backend: service: name: aks-helloworld port: number: 80 path: / pathType: Prefix tls: - hosts: - <host-name> secretName: keyvault-<your-ingress-name>`

Create the cluster resources using the

command.`kubectl apply`

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n hello-web-app-routing`

The following example output shows the created resource:

`Ingress.networking.k8s.io/aks-helloworld created`


## Verify the managed ingress was created

Verify the managed ingress was created using the

command.`kubectl get ingress`

`kubectl get ingress -n hello-web-app-routing`

The following example output shows the created managed ingress:

`NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE aks-helloworld webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com myapp.contoso.com 20.51.92.19 80, 443 4m`

# Upgrade the operating system (OS) version for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Windows workloads

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

When upgrading the OS version of a running Windows workload on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you need to deploy a new node pool to ensure the Windows versions match on each node pool. This article describes the steps to upgrade the OS version for Windows workloads on AKS.

## Windows Server OS version support

When a new Windows Server OS version is released, AKS is committed to supporting it. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of the fixes, improvements, and new functionality. AKS provides a five-year support lifecycle for every Windows Server version, starting with Windows Server 2022. During this period, AKS releases a new version that supports a newer version of Windows Server OS for you to upgrade to. After the five-year lifecycle ends, you must migrate workloads to newer supported versions to ensure compatibility, security updates, and continued support from AKS.

Note

[Windows Server 2019 retires on March 1, 2026](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4091). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2019 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2019 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2019 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.33 and above. Starting on April 1, 2027, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2019, meaning that scaling operations will fail.[Windows Server 2022 retires on March 15, 2027](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/4168). After that date, AKS will no longer produce new node images or provide security patches. After that date, you will not be able to create new node pools with Windows Server 2022 on any Kubernetes version. All existing node pools with Windows Server 2022 will be unsupported. Windows Server 2022 is not supported in Kubernetes version 1.36 and above. Starting on April 1, 2028, AKS will remove all existing node images for Windows Server 2022, meaning that scaling operations will fail.

For more information, see [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases). To stay up to date on the latest Windows Server OS versions and learn more about our roadmap of what's planned for support on AKS, see our [AKS public roadmap](https://github.com/azure/aks/projects/1).

## Limitations

- Node pool update to migrate from one Windows Server version to another isn't supported.
- Different Windows Server versions can't coexist on the same node pool on AKS. You need to create a new node pool to host the new OS version. It's important that you match the permissions and access of the previous node pool to the new one.
- Windows Server 2025 (preview) is supported starting in Kubernetes version 1.32.

## Before you begin

- Update the
`FROM`

statement in your Dockerfile to the new OS version. - Check your application and verify the container app works on the new OS version.
- Deploy the verified container app on AKS to a development or testing environment.
- Take note of the new image name or tag for use in this article.

Note

To learn how to build a Dockerfile for Windows workloads, see [Dockerfile on Windows](/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/manage-windows-dockerfile) and [Optimize Windows Dockerfiles](/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-docker/optimize-windows-dockerfile).

### Install `aks-preview`

extension

Install the

`aks-preview`

Azure CLI extension using thecommand.`az extension add`

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

`az extension add --name aks-preview`

Update to the latest version of the extension using the

command.`az extension update`

**Windows Server 2025 requires a minimum of 18.0.0b5**.`az extension update --name aks-preview`


### Register `AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag

Register the

`AksWindows2025Preview`

feature flag using the [`az feature register`

][az-feature-register] command.`az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AksWindows2025Preview"`

Verify the registration status using the [

`az feature show`

][az-feature-show] command. It takes a few minutes for the status to show*Registered*.`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AksWindows2025Preview`

When the status reflects

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the*Microsoft.ContainerService*resource provider using the [`az provider register`

][az-provider-register] command.`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Add a new node pool to an existing cluster

Add a node pool with your desired OS version to your existing cluster:

[Use CLI to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-cli)to an existing cluster.[Use Portal to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-portal)to an existing cluster.[Use PowerShell to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-powershell)to an existing cluster.[Use Terraform to add a Windows node pool](learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-terraform)to an existing cluster.

## Update the YAML file

Node Selector is the most common and recommended option for placement of Windows pods on Windows nodes.

Add Node Selector to your YAML file by adding the following annotation:

`nodeSelector: "kubernetes.io/os": windows`

The annotation finds any available Windows node and places the pod on that node (following all other scheduling rules). When upgrading your OS version, you need to enforce the placement on a Windows node and a node running the latest OS version. To accomplish this, one option is to use a different annotation. Update

`<OSSKU>`

to match the ossku your desired Windows OS version, for example`Windows2025`

.`nodeSelector: "kubernetes.azure.com/os-sku": <OSSKU>`

Once you update the

`nodeSelector`

in the YAML file, you also need to update the container image you want to use. You can get this information from the previous step in which you created a new version of the containerized application by changing the`FROM`

statement on your Dockerfile.Note

You should use the same YAML file you used to initially deploy the application. This ensures that no other configuration changes besides the

`nodeSelector`

and container image.

## Apply the updated YAML file to the existing workload

View the nodes on your cluster using the

`kubectl get nodes`

command.`kubectl get nodes -o wide`

The following example output shows all nodes on the cluster, including the new node pool you created and the existing node pools:

`NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION INTERNAL-IP EXTERNAL-IP OS-IMAGE KERNEL-VERSION CONTAINER-RUNTIME aks-agentpool-18877473-vmss000000 Ready agent 5h40m v1.23.8 10.240.0.4 <none> Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS 5.4.0-1085-azure containerd://1.5.11+azure-2 akspoolws000000 Ready agent 3h15m v1.23.8 10.240.0.208 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akspoolws000001 Ready agent 3h17m v1.23.8 10.240.0.239 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akspoolws000002 Ready agent 3h17m v1.23.8 10.240.1.14 <none> Windows Server 2022 Datacenter 10.0.20348.825 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000000 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.115 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000001 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.146 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure akswspool000002 Ready agent 5h37m v1.23.8 10.240.0.177 <none> Windows Server 2019 Datacenter 10.0.17763.3165 containerd://1.6.6+azure`

Apply the updated YAML file to the existing workload using the

`kubectl apply`

command and specify the name of the YAML file.`kubectl apply -f <filename>`

The following example output shows a

*configured*status for the deployment:`deployment.apps/sample configured service/sample unchanged`

At this point, AKS starts the process of terminating the existing pods and deploying new pods to the nodes with the

`nodeSelector`

annotation.Check the status of the deployment using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the pods in the

`default`

namespace:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES sample-7794bfcc4c-k62cq 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.238 akspoolws000000 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-rswq9 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.1.10 akspoolws000001 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-sh78c 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.228 akspoolws000000 <none> <none>`


## Security and authentication considerations

If you're using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), you need to update the Managed Identity configuration for the new node pool. gMSA uses a secret (user account and password) so the node that runs the Windows pod can authenticate the container against Microsoft Entra ID. To access that secret on Azure Key Vault, the node uses a Managed Identity that allows the node to access the resource. Since Managed Identities are configured per node pool, and the pod now resides on a new node pool, you need to update that configuration. For more information, see [Enable Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for your Windows Server nodes on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-group-managed-service-accounts).

The same principle applies to Managed Identities for any other pod or node pool when accessing other Azure resources. You need to update any access that Managed Identity provides to reflect the new node pool. To view update and sign-in activities, see [How to view Managed Identity activity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-view-managed-identity-activity).

Apply the updated YAML file to the existing workload using the

`kubectl apply`

command and specify the name of the YAML file.`kubectl apply -f <filename>`

The following example output shows a

At this point, AKS starts the process of terminating the existing pods and deploying new pods to the nodes with the

`nodeSelector`

annotation.Check the status of the deployment using the

`kubectl get pods`

command.`kubectl get pods -o wide`

The following example output shows the pods in the

`default`

namespace:`NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES sample-7794bfcc4c-k62cq 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.238 akspoolws000000 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-rswq9 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.1.10 akspoolws000001 <none> <none> sample-7794bfcc4c-sh78c 1/1 Running 0 2m49s 10.240.0.228 akspoolws000000 <none> <none>`


## Security and authentication considerations

If you're using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA), you need to update the Managed Identity configuration for the new node pool. gMSA uses a secret (user account and password) so the node that runs the Windows pod can authenticate the container against Microsoft Entra ID. To access that secret on Azure Key Vault, the node uses a Managed Identity that allows the node to access the resource. Since Managed Identities are configured per node pool, and the pod now resides on a new node pool, you need to update that configuration. For more information, see [Enable Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA) for your Windows Server nodes on your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](use-group-managed-service-accounts).

The same principle applies to Managed Identities for any other pod or node pool when accessing other Azure resources. You need to update any access that Managed Identity provides to reflect the new node pool. To view update and sign-in activities, see [How to view Managed Identity activity](/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-view-managed-identity-activity).

# Use Image Integrity to validate signed images before deploying them to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters (Preview)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and its underlying container model provide increased scalability and manageability for cloud native applications. With AKS, you can launch flexible software applications according to the runtime needs of your system. However, this flexibility can introduce new challenges.

In these application environments, using signed container images helps verify that your deployments are built from a trusted entity and that images haven't been tampered with since their creation. Image Integrity is a service that allows you to add an Azure Policy built-in definition to verify that only signed images are deployed to your AKS clusters.

Note

Image Integrity is a feature based on [Ratify](https://github.com/deislabs/ratify). On an AKS cluster, the feature name and property name is `ImageIntegrity`

, while the relevant Image Integrity pods' names contain `Ratify`

.

Important

AKS preview features are available on a self-service, opt-in basis. Previews are provided "as is" and "as available," and they're excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. AKS previews are partially covered by customer support on a best-effort basis. As such, these features aren't meant for production use. For more information, see the following support articles:

## Prerequisites

An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a

[free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).`aks-preview`

CLI extension version 0.5.96 or later.Ensure that the Azure Policy add-on for AKS is enabled on your cluster. If you don't have this add-on installed, see

[Install Azure Policy add-on for AKS](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks).An AKS cluster enabled with OIDC Issuer. To create a new cluster or update an existing cluster, see

[Configure an AKS cluster with OIDC Issuer](use-oidc-issuer).The

`EnableImageIntegrityPreview`

feature flags registered on your Azure subscription. Register the feature flags using the following commands:Register the

`EnableImageIntegrityPreview`

feature flags using thecommand.`az feature register`

`# Register the EnableImageIntegrityPreview feature flag az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnableImageIntegrityPreview" It may take a few minutes for the status to show as *Registered*.`

Verify the registration status using the

command.`az feature show`

`# Verify the EnableImageIntegrityPreview feature flag registration status az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "EnableImageIntegrityPreview"`

Once the status shows

*Registered*, refresh the registration of the`Microsoft.ContainerService`

resource provider using thecommand.`az provider register`

`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService`


## Considerations and limitations

- Your AKS clusters must run Kubernetes version 1.26 or above.
- You shouldn't use this feature for production Azure Container Registry (ACR) registries or workloads.
- Image Integrity supports a maximum of 200 unique signatures concurrently cluster-wide.
- Notation is the only supported verifier.
- Audit is the only supported verification policy effect.

## How Image Integrity works

Image Integrity uses Ratify, Azure Policy, and Gatekeeper to validate signed images before deploying them to your AKS clusters. Enabling Image Integrity on your cluster deploys a `Ratify`

pod. This `Ratify`

pod performs the following tasks:

- Reconciles certificates from Azure Key Vault per the configuration you set up through
`Ratify`

CRDs. - Accesses images stored in ACR when validation requests come from
[Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes). To enable this experience, Azure Policy extends Gatekeeper, an admission controller webhook for[Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). - Determines whether the target image is signed with a trusted cert and therefore considered as
*trusted*. `AzurePolicy`

and`Gatekeeper`

consume the validation results as the compliance state to decide whether to allow the deployment request.

## Enable Image Integrity on your AKS cluster

Note

Image signature verification is a governance-oriented scenario and leverages [Azure Policy](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) to verify image signatures on AKS clusters at-scale. We recommend using AKS's Image Integrity built-in Azure Policy initiative, which is available in [Azure Policy's built-in definition library](/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies#kubernetes).

Create a policy assignment with the AKS policy initiative

using the`[Preview]: Use Image Integrity to ensure only trusted images are deployed`

command.`az policy assignment create`

`export SCOPE="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}" export LOCATION=$(az group show --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --query location -o tsv) az policy assignment create --name 'deploy-trustedimages' --policy-set-definition 'af28bf8b-c669-4dd3-9137-1e68fdc61bd6' --display-name 'Audit deployment with unsigned container images' --scope ${SCOPE} --mi-system-assigned --role Contributor --identity-scope ${SCOPE} --location ${LOCATION}`

The

`Ratify`

pod deploys after you enable the feature.

Note

The policy deploys the Image Integrity feature on your cluster when it detects any update operation on the cluster. If you want to enable the feature immediately, you need to create a policy remediation using the [ az policy remediation create](/en-us/cli/azure/policy/remediation#az-policy-remediation-create) command.

```
assignment_id=$(az policy assignment show --name 'deploy-trustedimages' --scope ${SCOPE} --query id -o tsv)
az policy remediation create --policy-assignment "$assignment_id" --definition-reference-id deployAKSImageIntegrity --name remediation --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```


## Set up verification configurations

For Image Integrity to properly verify the target signed image, you need to set up `Ratify`

configurations through K8s [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) using `kubectl`

.

In this article, we use a self-signed CA cert from the official Ratify documentation to set up verification configurations. For more examples, see [Ratify CRDs](https://ratify.dev/docs/1.0/ratify-configuration).

Create a

`VerifyConfig`

file named`verify-config.yaml`

and copy in the following YAML:`apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: KeyManagementProvider metadata: name: certstore-inline spec: provider: inline parameters: value: | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDQzCCAiugAwIBAgIUDxHQ9JxxmnrLWTA5rAtIZCzY8mMwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQAwKTEPMA0GA1UECgwGUmF0aWZ5MRYwFAYDVQQDDA1SYXRpZnkgU2FtcGxlMB4X DTIzMDYyOTA1MjgzMloXDTMzMDYyNjA1MjgzMlowKTEPMA0GA1UECgwGUmF0aWZ5 MRYwFAYDVQQDDA1SYXRpZnkgU2FtcGxlMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8A MIIBCgKCAQEAshmsL2VM9ojhgTVUUuEsZro9jfI27VKZJ4naWSHJihmOki7IoZS8 3/3ATpkE1lGbduJ77M9UxQbEW1PnESB0bWtMQtjIbser3mFCn15yz4nBXiTIu/K4 FYv6HVdc6/cds3jgfEFNw/8RVMBUGNUiSEWa1lV1zDM2v/8GekUr6SNvMyqtY8oo ItwxfUvlhgMNlLgd96mVnnPVLmPkCmXFN9iBMhSce6sn6P9oDIB+pr1ZpE4F5bwa gRBg2tWN3Tz9H/z2a51Xbn7hCT5OLBRlkorHJl2HKKRoXz1hBgR8xOL+zRySH9Qo 3yx6WvluYDNfVbCREzKJf9fFiQeVe0EJOwIDAQABo2MwYTAdBgNVHQ4EFgQUKzci EKCDwPBn4I1YZ+sDdnxEir4wHwYDVR0jBBgwFoAUKzciEKCDwPBn4I1YZ+sDdnxE ir4wDwYDVR0TAQH/BAUwAwEB/zAOBgNVHQ8BAf8EBAMCAgQwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL BQADggEBAGh6duwc1MvV+PUYvIkDfgj158KtYX+bv4PmcV/aemQUoArqM1ECYFjt BlBVmTRJA0lijU5I0oZje80zW7P8M8pra0BM6x3cPnh/oZGrsuMizd4h5b5TnwuJ hRvKFFUVeHn9kORbyQwRQ5SpL8cRGyYp+T6ncEmo0jdIOM5dgfdhwHgb+i3TejcF 90sUs65zovUjv1wa11SqOdu12cCj/MYp+H8j2lpaLL2t0cbFJlBY6DNJgxr5qync cz8gbXrZmNbzC7W5QK5J7fcx6tlffOpt5cm427f9NiK2tira50HU7gC3HJkbiSTp Xw10iXXMZzSbQ0/Hj2BF4B40WfAkgRg= -----END CERTIFICATE----- --- apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: Store metadata: name: store-oras spec: name: oras # If you want to you use Workload Identity for Ratify to access Azure Container Registry, # uncomment the following lines, and fill the proper ClientID: # See more: https://ratify.dev/docs/reference/oras-auth-provider # parameters: # authProvider: # name: azureWorkloadIdentity # clientID: XXX --- apiVersion: config.ratify.deislabs.io/v1beta1 kind: Verifier metadata: name: verifier-notary-inline spec: name: notation artifactTypes: application/vnd.cncf.notary.signature parameters: verificationCertStores: # certificates for validating signatures certs: # name of the trustStore - certstore-inline # name of the certificate store CRD to include in this trustStore trustPolicyDoc: # policy language that indicates which identities are trusted to produce artifacts version: "1.0" trustPolicies: - name: default registryScopes: - "*" signatureVerification: level: strict trustStores: - ca:certs trustedIdentities: - "*"`

Apply the

`VerifyConfig`

to your cluster using the`kubectl apply`

command.`kubectl apply -f verify-config.yaml`


## Deploy sample images to your AKS cluster

Deploy a signed image using the

`kubectl run demo`

command.`kubectl run demo-signed --image=ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:signed`

The following example output shows that Image Integrity allows the deployment:

`ghcr.io/deislabs/ratify/notary-image:signed pod/demo-signed created`


If you want to use your own images, see the [guidance for image signing](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-sign-build-push).

## Disable Image Integrity

### Remove policy initiative

First you should remove the policy initiative using the

command.`az policy assignment delete`

`az policy assignment delete --name 'deploy-trustedimages'`


### Diable add-on

Then disable Image Integrity add-on on your cluster using the

command with the`az aks update`

`--disable-image-integrity`

flag.`az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name MyManagedCluster --disable-image-integrity`


## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to use Image Integrity to validate signed images before deploying them to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. If you want to learn how to sign your own containers, see [Build, sign, and verify container images using Notary and Azure Key Vault (Preview)](/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-sign-build-push).

# Install and Configure Kueue on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Note

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [signing in](#) or [changing directories].

Access to this page requires authorization. You can try [changing directories].

In this article, you learn how to install and configure Kueue to schedule batch workloads on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. You also explore different Kueue concepts, installation methods to enable advanced Kueue features, and learn how to verify your deployments.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

## What are batch workloads?

Batch deployments are typically non-interactive workloads that are retriable, have a finite duration, and might experience spiky or bursty resource usage. These workloads include, but aren't limited to:

- Data processing jobs.
- Security vulnerability scans.
- Media encoding or video transcoding.
- Report generation or financial analysis.
- GPU workloads that require all resources to be available and might tolerate a delayed start but can't tolerate partial GPU allocation.

These workloads are often modeled using a Kubernetes Job, CronJob, or custom resource definition (CRD) like [RayJob](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/rayjob-quick-start.html) or [Kubeflow MPIJob](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/trainer/legacy-v1/user-guides/mpi/). Batch deployments present the following set of distinct requirements from general purpose deployments:

- Scheduling logic beyond selecting the first available node.
- Fairness, queueing, and resource awareness.
- Lifecycle awareness of jobs and pods.

The default AKS scheduler satisfies the requirements of Kubernetes services but provides limited configuration for batch workloads that require a job queueing system.

## What is Kueue?

[Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/overview/) is an open-source Kubernetes-native job queueing project designed to manage batch workloads and ensure efficient, fair, and policy-driven scheduling in Kubernetes clusters. Kueue integrates with the [Kubernetes scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scheduling/README.md) ecosystem to coordinate resource allocation, prioritization, and capacity control for batch jobs.

Important

Open-source software is mentioned throughout AKS documentation and samples. Software that you deploy is excluded from AKS service-level agreements, limited warranty, and Azure support. As you use open-source technology alongside AKS, consult the support options available from the respective communities and project maintainers to develop a plan.

Microsoft takes responsibility for building the open-source packages that we deploy on AKS. That responsibility includes having complete ownership of the build, scan, sign, validate, and hotfix process, along with control over the binaries in container images. For more information, see [Vulnerability management for AKS](concepts-vulnerability-management#aks-container-images) and [AKS support coverage](support-policies#aks-support-coverage).

Kueue introduces a two-level queuing model:

- A
`ClusterQueue`

represents shared resource pools (such as CPU, memory, GPU quotas). - A
`LocalQueue`

represents a tenant-facing queue in a namespace (where users submit their batch jobs).

Workloads submitted to a `LocalQueue`

are matched to a `ClusterQueue`

to determine if they can be admitted.

Note

A `LocalQueue`

is always needed for users to submit batch workloads, and the `LocalQueue`

tells Kueue about which ClusterQueue to assign the job to. The `ClusterQueue`

determines if sufficient resources are available for the job to be admitted and run.

## Who can use Kueue?

Batch workload administrators (including platform or cluster administrators and DevOps engineers) and batch users (data scientists, developers, and ML engineers) can benefit from deploying workloads with Kueue on AKS.

A batch admin focuses on configuring, managing, and securing the platform-level infrastructure to support batch workloads, and have the following responsibilities:

- Provision and manage AKS node pools.
- Define resource quotas, ClusterQueues, and policies for workload isolation.
- Tune autoscaling and cost-efficiency (such as the Cluster Autoscaler or Kueue quotas).
- Monitor cluster and queue health.
- Create and maintain templates and reusable workflows.

A batch user runs compute-intensive or parallel jobs using the platform-level infrastructure configured by a batch admin, and typically:

- Submit batch jobs (such as Job, Workload, or custom controller CRDs) and monitor job status and outputs
- Select appropriate queue or resource flavor for jobs (based on guidance from batch admins)
- Optimize job specs for resource and performance needs

| Queue Type | Scope | Created By | Used For |
|---|---|---|---|
ClusterQueue |
Cluster-wide | Platform admin | Define shared compute capacity and quota management |
LocalQueue |
Namespace | Namespace owner | Enable workload submission, mapped to ClusterQueue |

## Prerequisites

- An existing AKS cluster. If you don't have a cluster, create one using the
[Azure CLI](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli),[Azure PowerShell](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-powershell), or the[Azure portal](learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal). - Azure CLI installed on your local machine. To install or upgrade, see
[Install the Azure CLI](/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). [Helm version 3 or above](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)installed.

## Install Kueue with Helm

While most features and scheduling policies that you might require are enabled by default, some aren't like `TopologyAwareScheduling`

. If needed, reconfigure your Kueue installation by changing the default [Feature Gates](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/installation/#feature-gates-for-alpha-and-beta-features) or by configuring [Kueue paramater values](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/main/charts/kueue/README.md#configuration) in the `values.yaml`

file of the Helm chart.

Kueue supports multiple workload [Frameworks](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/run/) that you need to explicitly enable to use Kueue’s scheduling and resource management capabilities when running [MPI Operator](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/mpi/) MPIJobs, [KubeRay's](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay) [RayJob](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/getting-started/rayjob-quick-start.html) and more.

In this guide, Kueue is configured to include `LocalQueueMetrics`

and `Topology Aware Scheduling`

and frameworks from Kubeflow, Ray, and [JobSet](https://jobset.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/).

`LocalQueueMetrics`

provides detailed Prometheus metrics specific to the state and activity of LocalQueues, enabling fine-grained monitoring of workload admission, quota reservation, and resource utilization.`TopologyAwareScheduling`

allows scheduling of pods based on the topology of nodes in a pool or cluster to improve available bandwidth between the pods.

Note

Update version as needed: [kueue/releases](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases)

Create and save a

`values.yaml`

file to optionally customize your Kueue configuration.`cat <<EOF > values.yaml controllerManager: featureGates: - name: TopologyAwareScheduling enabled: true - name: LocalQueueMetrics enabled: true managerConfig: controllerManagerConfigYaml: | apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Configuration integrations: frameworks: - batch/job - kubeflow.org/mpijob - ray.io/rayjob - ray.io/raycluster - jobset.x-k8s.io/jobset - kubeflow.org/paddlejob - kubeflow.org/pytorchjob - kubeflow.org/tfjob - kubeflow.org/xgboostjob - kubeflow.org/jaxjob EOF`

Install the latest version of the Kueue controller and CRDs in a dedicated namespace using the

`helm install`

command.`LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4 | sed 's/^v//') helm install kueue oci://registry.k8s.io/kueue/charts/kueue \ --version=${LATEST_VERSION} \ --create-namespace --namespace=kueue-system \ --values values.yaml`

Confirm the deployment status using the

`helm list`

command.`helm list --namespace kueue-system`

Your output should include a

`Status`

of`deployed`

and look like:`Pulled: registry.k8s.io/kueue/charts/kueue:0.13.4 Digest: - NAME: kueue LAST DEPLOYED: - NAMESPACE: kueue-system STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None`


## Confirm deployment status

Verify that controller pods are running properly.

`kubectl get deploy -n kueue-system`

Your output should look similar to the following example output:

`NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE kueue-controller-manager 1/1 1 1 7s`

Confirm the installation of Kueue resources on your AKS cluster:

`kubectl get crds | grep kueue`

Your output should include the following Kueue CRDs:

`admissionchecks.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z clusterqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z cohorts.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z localqueues.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z multikueueclusters.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z multikueueconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z provisioningrequestconfigs.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z resourceflavors.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z topologies.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z workloadpriorityclasses.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z workloads.kueue.x-k8s.io 2025-09-11T18:20:48Z`


## Uninstall Kueue

If you no longer need to use the Kueue controller manager or Kueue custom resources in your AKS cluster, you can uninstall the Helm repository and remove the dedicated namespace and resources.

Uninstall the Kueue Helm repository using the

`helm uninstall`

command.`helm uninstall kueue --namespace kueue-system`

Remove the dedicated namespace and resources using the

`kubectl delete`

command.`kubectl delete namespace kueue-system`
