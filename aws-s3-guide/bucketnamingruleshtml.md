# General purpose bucket naming rules

When you create a general purpose bucket, make sure that you consider the length, valid characters, formatting, and uniqueness of bucket names. The following sections provide information about general purpose bucket naming, including naming rules, best practices, and an example for creating a general purpose bucket with a name that includes a globally unique identifier (GUID).

For information about object key names, see [Creating object key
names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html).

To create a general purpose bucket, see [Creating a general purpose bucket](./create-bucket-overview.html).

###### Topics

## General purpose buckets naming rules

The following naming rules apply for general purpose buckets.

-
Bucket names must be between 3 (min) and 63 (max) characters long.

-
Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, periods (

`.`

), and hyphens (`-`

). -
Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number.

-
Bucket names must not contain two adjacent periods.

-
Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (for example,

`192.168.5.4`

). -
Bucket names must not start with the prefix

`xn--`

. -
Bucket names must not start with the prefix

`sthree-`

. -
Bucket names must not start with the prefix

`amzn-s3-demo-`

. -
Bucket names must not end with the suffix

`-s3alias`

. This suffix is reserved for access point alias names. For more information, see[Access point aliases](./access-points-naming.html#access-points-alias). -
Bucket names must not end with the suffix

`--ol-s3`

. This suffix is reserved for Object Lambda Access Point alias names. For more information, see[How to use a bucket-style alias for your S3 bucket Object Lambda Access Point](./olap-use.html#ol-access-points-alias). -
Bucket names must not end with the suffix

`.mrap`

. This suffix is reserved for Multi-Region Access Point names. For more information, see[Rules for naming Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points](./multi-region-access-point-naming.html). -
Bucket names must not end with the suffix

`--x-s3`

. This suffix is reserved for directory buckets. For more information, see[Directory bucket naming rules](./directory-bucket-naming-rules.html). -
Bucket names must not end with the suffix

`--table-s3`

. This suffix is reserved for S3 Tables buckets. For more information, see[Amazon S3 table bucket, table, and namespace naming rules](./s3-tables-buckets-naming.html). -
Buckets used with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can't have periods (

`.`

) in their names. For more information about Transfer Acceleration, see[Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](./transfer-acceleration.html).

###### Important

-
Bucket names

**must**be unique across all AWS accounts in all of the AWS Regions within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions:`aws`

(commercial Regions),`aws-cn`

(China Regions), and`aws-us-gov`

(AWS GovCloud (US) Regions). -
A bucket name can't be used by another AWS account in the same partition until the bucket is deleted.

**After you delete a bucket, be aware that another AWS account in the same partition can use the same bucket name for a new bucket and can therefore potentially receive requests intended for the deleted bucket.**If you want to prevent this, or if you want to continue to use the same bucket name, don't delete the bucket. We recommend that you empty the bucket and keep it, and instead, block any bucket requests as needed. For buckets no longer in active use, we recommend emptying the bucket of all objects to minimize costs while retaining the bucket itself. -
When you create a general purpose bucket, you choose its name and the AWS Region to create it in. After you create a general purpose bucket, you can't change its name or Region.

-
Don't include sensitive information in the bucket name. The bucket name is visible in the URLs that point to the objects in the bucket.


###### Note

Before March 1, 2018, buckets created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region could have names that were up to 255 characters long and included uppercase letters and underscores. Beginning March 1, 2018, new buckets in US East (N. Virginia) must conform to the same rules applied in all other Regions.

## Example general purpose bucket names

The following bucket names show examples of which characters are allowed in general
purpose bucket names: a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (`-`

). The
`amzn-s3-demo-`

reserved prefix is used here only for illustration.
Because it's a reserved prefix, you can't create bucket names that start with
`amzn-s3-demo-`

.

-
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-example11111`

-
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket`


The following example bucket names are valid but not recommended for uses other than
static website hosting because they contain periods (`.`

):

-
`example.com`

-
`www.example.com`

-
`my.example.s3.bucket`


The following example bucket names are *not*
valid:

-
`amzn_s3_demo_bucket`

(contains underscores) -
`AmznS3DemoBucket`

(contains uppercase letters) -
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket-`

(starts with`amzn-s3-demo-`

prefix and ends with a hyphen) -
`example..com`

(contains two periods in a row) -
`192.168.5.4`

(matches format of an IP address)

## Best practices

When naming your general purpose buckets, consider the following bucket naming best practices.

###### Choose a bucket naming scheme that's unlikely to cause naming conflicts

If your application automatically creates buckets, choose a bucket naming scheme that's unlikely to cause naming conflicts. Ensure that your application logic will choose a different bucket name if a bucket name is already taken.

###### Append globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) to bucket names

We recommend that you create bucket names that aren't predictable. Don't write
code assuming your chosen bucket name is available unless you have already created
the bucket. One method for creating bucket names that aren't predictable is to
append a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) to your bucket name, for example,
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-example11111`

.
For more information, see [Creating a bucket that uses a GUID in the
bucket name](#create-bucket-name-guid).

###### Avoid using periods (`.`

) in bucket names

For best compatibility, we recommend that you avoid using periods (`.`

)
in bucket names, except for buckets that are used only for static website hosting.
If you include periods in a bucket's name, you can't use virtual-host-style
addressing over HTTPS, unless you perform your own certificate validation. The
security certificates used for virtual hosting of buckets don't work for buckets
with periods in their names.

This limitation doesn't affect buckets used for static website hosting, because static
website hosting is available only over HTTP. For more information about
virtual-host-style addressing, see [Virtual hosting of general purpose buckets](./VirtualHosting.html). For more information about static website hosting,
see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](./WebsiteHosting.html).

###### Choose a relevant name

When you name a bucket, we recommend that you choose a name that's relevant to you
or your business. Avoid using names associated with others. For example, avoid using
`AWS`

or `Amazon`

in your bucket name.

###### Don't delete buckets so that you can reuse bucket names

If a bucket is empty, you can delete it. After a bucket is deleted, the name becomes available for reuse. However, you aren't guaranteed to be able to reuse the name right away, or at all. After you delete a bucket, some time might pass before you can reuse the name. In addition, another AWS account might create a bucket with the same name before you can reuse the name.

**After you delete a general purpose bucket, be aware that another AWS account
in the same partition can use the same bucket name for a new bucket and can
therefore potentially receive requests intended for the deleted general purpose bucket.**
If you want to prevent this, or if you want to continue to use the same general purpose bucket name,
don't delete the general purpose bucket. We recommend that you empty the bucket and keep it, and
instead, block any bucket requests as needed.

## Creating a bucket that uses a GUID in the bucket name

The following examples show you how to create a general purpose bucket that uses a GUID at the end of the bucket name.

The following AWS CLI example creates a general purpose bucket in the US West (N. California) Region
(`us-west-1`

) Region with an example bucket name that uses a globally
unique identifier (GUID). To use this example command, replace the

with your own information.`user input placeholders`


`aws s3api create-bucket \ --bucket`

`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`

$(uuidgen | tr -d - | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' ) \ --region`us-west-1`

\ --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=`us-west-1`


The following example shows you how to create a with a GUID at the end
of the bucket name in US East (N. Virginia) Region (`us-east-1`

) by using the
AWS SDK for Java. To use this example, replace the

with your own information. For information about other AWS SDKs, see `user input placeholders`

[Tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/).

`import com.amazonaws.regions.Regions; import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3; import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder; import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.Bucket; import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.CreateBucketRequest; import java.util.List; import java.util.UUID; public class CreateBucketWithUUID { public static void main(String[] args) { final AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard().withRegion(Regions.`

`US_EAST_1`

).build(); String bucketName = "`amzn-s3-demo-bucket`

" + UUID.randomUUID().toString().replace("-", ""); CreateBucketRequest createRequest = new CreateBucketRequest(bucketName); System.out.println(bucketName); s3.createBucket(createRequest); } }
