# Configuring fast, secure file transfers using

# Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 general purpose bucket. Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 general purpose buckets. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront. As the data arrives at an edge location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

When you use Transfer Acceleration, additional data transfer charges might apply. For more
information about pricing, see [Amazon S3
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

## Why use Transfer Acceleration?

You might want to use Transfer Acceleration on a general purpose bucket for various reasons:

-
Your customers upload to a centralized general purpose bucket from all over the world.

-
You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.

-
You can't use all of your available bandwidth over the internet when uploading to Amazon S3.


For more information about when to use Transfer Acceleration, see [Amazon S3 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#s3ta).

## Requirements for using Transfer Acceleration

The following are required when you are using Transfer Acceleration on an S3 bucket:

-
Transfer Acceleration is only supported on virtual-hosted style requests. For more information about virtual-hosted style requests, see

[Making requests using the REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTAPI.html)in the*Amazon S3 API Reference*. -
The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (".").

-
Transfer Acceleration must be enabled on the bucket. For more information, see

[Enabling and using S3 Transfer Acceleration](./transfer-acceleration-examples.html).After you enable Transfer Acceleration on a bucket, it might take up to 20 minutes before the data transfer speed to the bucket increases.

###### Note

Transfer Acceleration is currently supported for buckets located in the following Regions:

-
Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)

-
Asia Pacific (Seoul) (ap-northeast-2)

-
Asia Pacific (Mumbai) (ap-south-1)

-
Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)

-

-
To access the bucket that is enabled for Transfer Acceleration, you must use the endpoint


. Or, use the dual-stack endpoint`bucket-name`

.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com

to connect to the enabled bucket over IPv6. You can continue to use the regular endpoints for standard data transfer.`bucket-name`

.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com -
You must be the bucket owner to set the transfer acceleration state. The bucket owner can assign permissions to other users to allow them to set the acceleration state on a bucket. The

`s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration`

permission permits users to enable or disable Transfer Acceleration on a bucket. The`s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration`

permission permits users to return the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either`Enabled`

or`Suspended.`
