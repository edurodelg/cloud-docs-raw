`ArimaForecastingMetrics(mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs)`


Model evaluation metrics for ARIMA forecasting models.

## Attributes |
|
|---|---|
Name |
Description |
`non_seasonal_order` |
`Sequence[`
Non-seasonal order. |
`arima_fitting_metrics` |
`Sequence[`
Arima model fitting metrics. |
`seasonal_periods` |
`Sequence[`
Seasonal periods. Repeated because multiple periods are supported for one time series. |
`has_drift` |
`Sequence[bool]`
Whether Arima model fitted with drift or not. It is always false when d is not 1. |
`time_series_id` |
`Sequence[str]`
Id to differentiate different time series for the large-scale case. |
`arima_single_model_forecasting_metrics` |
`Sequence[`
Repeated as there can be many metric sets (one for each model) in auto-arima and the large-scale case. |

## Classes

### ArimaSingleModelForecastingMetrics

```
ArimaSingleModelForecastingMetrics(
mapping=None, *, ignore_unknown_fields=False, **kwargs
)
```


Model evaluation metrics for a single ARIMA forecasting model.
