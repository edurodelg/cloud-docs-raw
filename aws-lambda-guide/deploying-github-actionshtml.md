# Using GitHub Actions to deploy Lambda functions

You can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically deploy Lambda functions when you push code or configuration changes to your repository. The

[Deploy Lambda Function](https://github.com/aws-actions/aws-lambda-deploy)action provides a declarative, simple YAML interface that eliminates the complexity of manual deployment steps.

## Example workflow

To configure automated Lambda function deployment, create a workflow file in your repository's
`.github/workflows/`

directory:

###### Example GitHub Actions workflow for Lambda deployment

`name: Deploy AWS Lambda on: push: branches: - main jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: id-token: write # Required for OIDC authentication contents: read # Required to check out the repository steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Configure AWS credentials uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4 with: role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionRole aws-region: us-east-1 - name: Deploy Lambda Function uses: aws-actions/aws-lambda-deploy@v1 with: function-name: my-lambda-function code-artifacts-dir: ./dist`


This workflow runs when you push changes to the `main`

branch. It checks out your repository,
configures AWS credentials using OpenID Connect (OIDC), and deploys your function using the code in the
`./dist`

directory.

For additional examples including updating function configuration, deploying via S3 buckets, and dry run validation, see the
[Deploy Lambda Function README](https://github.com/aws-actions/aws-lambda-deploy).
