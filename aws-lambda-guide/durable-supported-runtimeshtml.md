# Supported runtimes for durable functions

Durable functions are available for Node.js and Python runtimes. You can create durable functions using managed runtimes in the Lambda console or deploy them using container images for additional runtime version flexibility.

## Lambda managed runtimes

The following managed runtimes support durable functions when you create functions in the Lambda console or using the AWS CLI with the `--durable-config '{"ExecutionTimeout": 10, "RetentionPeriodInDays":1}'`

parameter. For complete information about Lambda runtimes, see [Lambda runtimes](./lambda-runtimes.html).

| Language | Runtime |
|---|---|
| Node.js | nodejs22.x |
| Node.js | nodejs24.x |
| Python | python3.13 |
| Python | python3.14 |

###### Note

Lambda runtimes include the durable execution SDK for testing and development. However, we recommend including the SDK in your deployment package for production. This ensures version consistency and avoids potential runtime updates that might affect your function behavior.

### Node.js

Install the SDK in your Node.js project:

`npm install @aws/durable-execution-sdk-js`


The SDK supports JavaScript and TypeScript. For TypeScript projects, the SDK includes type definitions.

### Python

Install the SDK in your Python project:

`pip install aws-durable-execution-sdk-python`


The Python SDK uses synchronous methods and doesn't require `async/await`

.

## Container images

You can use durable functions with container images to support additional runtime versions or custom runtime configurations. Container images let you use runtime versions not available as managed runtimes or customize your runtime environment.

To create a durable function using a container image:

Create a Dockerfile based on an Lambda base image

Install the durable execution SDK in your container

Build and push the container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry

Create the Lambda function from the container image with durable execution enabled


### Python container example

Create a Dockerfile for Python 3.11:

`FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11 # Copy requirements file COPY requirements.txt ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/ # Install dependencies including durable SDK RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # Copy function code COPY lambda_function.py ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/ # Set the handler CMD [ "lambda_function.handler" ]`


Create a `requirements.txt`

file:

`aws-durable-execution-sdk-python`


Build and push the image:

`# Build the image docker build -t my-durable-function . # Tag for ECR docker tag my-durable-function:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-durable-function:latest # Push to ECR docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-durable-function:latest`


Create the function with durable execution enabled:

`aws lambda create-function \ --function-name myDurableFunction \ --package-type Image \ --code ImageUri=123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-durable-function:latest \ --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-execution-role \ --durable-config '{"ExecutionTimeout": 10, "RetentionPeriodInDays":1}'`


For more information about using container images with Lambda, see [Creating Lambda container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html) in the Lambda Developer Guide.

## Runtime considerations

**SDK version management:** Include the durable execution SDK in your deployment package or container image. This ensures your function uses a specific SDK version and isn't affected by runtime updates. Pin SDK versions in your `package.json`

or `requirements.txt`

to control when you upgrade.

**Runtime updates:** AWS updates managed runtimes to include security patches and bug fixes. These updates may include new SDK versions. To avoid unexpected behavior, include the SDK in your deployment package and test thoroughly before deploying to production.

**Container image size:** Container images have a maximum uncompressed size of 10 GB. The durable execution SDK adds minimal size to your image. Optimize your container by using multi-stage builds and removing unnecessary dependencies.

**Cold start performance:** Container images may have longer cold start times than managed runtimes. The durable execution SDK has minimal impact on cold start performance. Use provisioned concurrency if cold start latency is critical for your application.
